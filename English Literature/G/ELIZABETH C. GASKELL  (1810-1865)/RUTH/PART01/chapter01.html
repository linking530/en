<DD>
There is an assize-town in one of the eastern counties which was much distinguished
by the Tudor Sovereigns, and, in consequence of their favour and protection,
attained a degree of importance that surprises the modern traveller.</DD>

<DD>
A hundred years ago its appearance was that of picturesque grandeur. The
old houses, which were the temporary residences of such of the county families
as contented themselves with the gaieties of a provincial town, crowded
the streets, and gave them the irregular but noble appearance yet to be
seen in the cities of Belgium. The sides of the streets had a quaint richness,
from the effect of the gables, and the stacks of chimneys which cut against
the blue sky above; while, if the eye fell lower down, the attention was
arrested by all kinds of projections in the shape of balcony and oriel;
and it was amusing to see the infinite variety of windows that had been
crammed into the walls long before Mr. Pitt's days of taxation. The streets
below suffered from all these projections and advanced stories above; they
were dark, and ill-paved with large, round, jolting pebbles, and with no
side-path protected by kerb-stones; there were no lamp-posts for long winter
nights; and no regard was paid to the wants of the middle class, who neither
drove about in coaches of their own, nor were carried by their own men
in their own sedans into the very halls of their friends. The professional
men and their wives, the shopkeepers and their spouses, and all such people,
walked about at considerable peril both night and day. The broad, unwieldy
carriages hemmed them up against the houses in the narrow streets. The
inhospitable houses projected their flights of steps almost into the carriage-way,
forcing pedestrians again into the danger they had avoided for twenty or
thirty paces. Then, at night, the only light was derived from the glaring,
flaring oil-lamps, hung above the doors of the more aristocratic mansions;
just allowing space for the passers-by to become visible, before they again
disappeared into the darkness, where it was no uncommon thing for robbers
to be in waiting for their prey.</DD>

<DD>
The traditions of those bygone times, even to the smallest social particular,
enable one to understand more clearly the circumstances which contributed
to the formation of character. The daily life into which people are born,
and into which they are absorbed before they are well aware, forms chains
which only one in a hundred has moral strength enough to despise, and to
break when the right time comes--when an inward necessity for independent
individual action arises, which is superior to all outward conventionalities.
Therefore, it is well to know what were the chains of dally domestic habit,
which were the natural leading strings of our forefathers before they learnt
to go alone.</DD>

<DD>
The picturesqueness of those ancient streets has departed now. The Astleys,
the Dunstans, the Waverhams--names of power in that district--go up duly
to London in the season, and have Sold their residences in the county town
fifty years ago, or more. And when the county town lost its attraction
for the Astleys, the Dunstans, the Waverhams, how could it be supposed
that the Domvilles, the Bextons, and the Wildes would continue to go and
winter there in their second-rate houses, and with their increased expenditure?
So the grand old houses stood empty awhile; and then speculators ventured
to purchase, and to turn the deserted mansions into many smaller dwellings,
fitted for professional men, or even (bend your ear lower, lest the shade
of Marmaduke, first Baron Waverham, hear) into shops!</DD>

<DD>
Even that was not so very bad, compared with the next innovation on the
old glories. The shopkeepers found out that the once fashionable street
was dark, and that the dingy light did not show off their goods to advantage;
the surgeon could not see to draw his patients' teeth; the lawyer had to
ring for candles an hour earlier than he was accustomed to do when living
in a more plebeian street. In short, by mutual consent, the whole front
of one side of the street was pulled down, and rebuilt in the flat, mean,
unrelieved style of George the Third. The body of the houses was too solidly
grand to submit to alteration; so people were occasionally surprised, after
passing through a commonplace-looking shop, to find themselves at the foot
of a grand carved oaken staircase, lighted by a window of stained glass,
storied all over with armorial bearings.</DD>

<DD>
Up such a stair--past such a window (through which the moonlight fell on
her with a glory of many colours)--Ruth Hilton passed wearily one January
night, now many years ago. I call it night; but, strictly speaking, it
was morning. Two o'clock in the morning chimed forth the old bells of St.
Saviour's. And yet, more than a dozen girls still sat in the room into
which Ruth entered, stitching away as if for very life, not daring to gape,
or show any outward manifestation of sleepiness. They only sighed a little
when Ruth told Mrs. Mason the hour of the night, as the result of her errand;
for they knew that, stay up as late as they might, the work-hours of the
next day must begin at eight, and their young limbs were very weary.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Mason worked away as hard as any of them; but she was older and tougher;
and, besides, the gains were hers. But even she perceived that some rest
was needed. "Young ladies! there will be an interval allowed of half-an-hour.
Ring the bell, Miss Sutton. Martha shall bring you up some bread, and cheese,
and beer. You will be so good as to eat it standing--away from the dresses--and
to have your hands washed ready for work when I return. In half-an-hour,"
said she once more, very distinctly; and then she left the room.</DD>

<DD>
It was curious to watch the young girls as they instantaneously availed
themselves of Mrs. Mason's absence. One fat, particularly heavy-looking
damsel laid her head on her folded arms and was asleep in a moment; refusing
to be wakened for her share in the frugal supper, but springing up with
a frightened look at the sound of Mrs. Mason's returning footstep, even
while it was still far off on the echoing stairs. Two or three others huddled
over the scanty fireplace, which, with every possible economy of space,
and no attempt whatever at anything of grace or ornament, was inserted
in the slight, flat-looking wall, that had been run up by the present owner
of the property to portion off this division of the grand old drawing-room
of the mansion. Some employed the time in eating their bread and cheese,
with as measured and incessant a motion of the jaws (and almost as stupidly
placid an expression of countenance), as you may see in cows ruminating
in the first meadow you happen to pass.</DD>

<DD>
Some held up admiringly the beautiful ball-dress in progress, while others
examined the effect, backing from the object to be criticised in the true
artistic manner. Others stretched themselves into all sorts of postures
to relieve the weary muscles; one or two gave vent to all the yawns, coughs,
and sneezes that bad been pent up so long in the presence of Mrs. Mason.
But Ruth Hilton sprang to the large old window, and pressed against it
as a bird presses against the bars of its cage. She put back the blind,
and gazed into the quiet moonlight night. It was doubly light--almost as
much so as day--for everything was covered with the deep snow which had
been falling silently ever since the evening before. The window was in
a square recess; the old strange little panes of glass had been replaced
by those which gave more light. A little distance off, the feathery branches
of a larch waved softly to and fro in the scarcely perceptible night-breeze.
Poor old larch! the time had been when it had stood in a pleasant lawn,
with the tender grass creeping caressingly up its very trunk; but now the
lawn was divided into yards and squalid back premises, and the larch was
pent up and girded about with flagstones. The snow lay thick on its boughs,
and now and then fell noiselessly down. The old stables had been added
to, and altered into a dismal street of mean-looking houses, back to back
with the ancient mansions. And over all these changes from grandeur to
squalor, bent down the purple heavens with their unchanging splendour!</DD>

<DD>
Ruth pressed her hot forehead against the cold glass, and strained her
aching eyes in gazing out on the lovely sky of a winter's night. The impulse
was strong upon her to snatch up a shawl, and, wrapping it round her head,
to sally forth and enjoy the glory; and time was when that impulse would
have been instantly followed; but now, Ruth's eyes filled with tears, and
she stood quite still dreaming of the days that were gone. Some one touched
her shoulder while her thoughts were far away, remembering past January
nights, which had resembled this, and were yet so different.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth, love," whispered a girl, who had unwillingly distinguished herself
by a long hard fit of coughing, "come and have some supper. You don't know
yet how it helps one through the night."</DD>

<DD>
"One run--one blow of the fresh air would do me more good," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Not such a night as this," replied the other, shivering at the very thought.</DD>

<DD>
"And why not such a night as this, Jenny?" answered Ruth. "Oh! at home
I have many a time run up the lane all the way to the mill, just to see
the icicles hang on the great wheel; and, when I was once out, I could
hardly find in my heart to come m, even to mother, sitting by the fire;--even
to mother," she added, in a low, melancholy tone, which had something of
inexpressible sadness in it. " Why, Jenny!" said she, rousing herself,
but not before her eyes were swimming in tears, "own, now, that you never
saw those dismal, hateful, tumble-down old houses there look half so--what
shall I call them? almost beautiful--as they do now, with that soft, pure,
exquisite covering; and if they are so improved, think of what trees, and
grass, and ivy must be on such a night as this."</DD>

<DD>
Jenny could not be persuaded into admiring the winter's night, which to
her came only as a cold and dismal time, when her cough was more troublesome,
and the pain in her side worse than usual. But she put her arm round Ruth's
neck, and stood by her, glad that the orphan apprentice, who was not yet
inured to the hardship of a dressmaker's workroom, should find so much
to give her pleasure in such a common occurrence as a frosty night.</DD>

<DD>
They remained deep in separate trains of thought till Mrs. Mason's step
was heard, when each returned supperless, but refreshed, to her seat.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth's place was the coldest and the darkest in the room, although she
liked it the best; she had instinctively chosen it for the sake of the
wall opposite to her, on which was a remnant of the beauty of the old drawing-room,
which must once have been magnificent, to judge from the faded specimen
left. It was divided into panels of pale sea-green, picked out with white
and gold; and on these panels were painted--were thrown with the careless,
triumphant hand of a master--the most lovely wreaths of flowers, profuse
and luxuriant beyond description, and so real-looking, that you could almost
fancy you smelt their fragrance, and heard the south wind go softly rustling
in and out among the crimson roses--the branches of purple and white lilac--the
floating golden-tressed laburnum boughs. Besides these, there were stately
white lilies, sacred to the Virgin--hollyhocks, fraxinella, monk's-hood,
pansies, primroses; every flower which blooms profusely in charming old-fashioned
country gardens was there, depicted among its graceful foliage, but not
in the wild disorder in which I have enumerated them. At the bottom of
the panel lay a holly branch, whose stiff straightness was ornamented by
a twining drapery of English ivy, and mistletoe, and winter aconite; while
down either side hung pendent garlands of spring and autumn flowers; and,
crowning all, carne gorgeous summer with the sweet musk-roses, and the
rich-coloured flowers of June and July.</DD>

<DD>
Surely Monnoyer, or whoever the dead-and-gone artist might be, would have
been gratified to know the pleasure his handiwork, even in its wane, had
power to give to the heavy heart of a young girl; for they conjured up
visions of other sister-flowers that grew, and blossomed, and withered
away in her early home.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Mason was particularly desirous that her workwomen should exert themselves
to-night, for, on the next, the annual hunt-ball was to take place. It
was the one gaiety of the town since the assize-balls had been discontinued.
Many were the dresses she had promised should be sent home "without fail"
the next morning; she had not let one slip through her fingers, for fear,
if it did, it might fall into the hands of the rival dressmaker, who had
just established herself in the very same street.</DD>

<DD>
She determined to administer a gentle stimulant to the flagging spirits,
and with a little preliminary cough to attract attention, she began--</DD>

<DD>
"I may as well inform you, young ladies, that I have been requested this
year, as on previous occasions, to allow some of my young people to attend
in the antechamber of the assembly-room with sandal ribbon, pins, and such
little matters, and to be ready to repair any accidental injury to the
ladies' dresses. I shall send four--of the most diligent." She laid a marked
emphasis on the last words, but without much effect; they were too sleepy
to care for any of the pomps and vanities, or, indeed, for any of the comforts
of this world, excepting one sole thing--their beds.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Mason was a very worthy woman, but, like many other worthy women,
she had her foibles; and one (very natural to her calling) was to pay an
extreme regard to appearances. Accordingly, she had already selected in
her own mind the four girls who were most likely to do credit to the "establishment;"
and these were secretly determined upon, although it was very well to promise
the reward to the most diligent. She was really not aware of the falseness
of this conduct; being an adept in that species of sophistry with which
people persuade themselves that what they wish to do is right.</DD>

<DD>
At last there was no resisting the evidence of weariness. They were told
to go to bed; but even that welcome command was languidly obeyed. Slowly
they folded up their work, heavily they moved about, until at length all
was put away, and they trooped up the wide, dark staircase.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! how shall I get through five years of these terrible nights! in that
close room! and in that oppressive stillness! which lets every sound of
the thread be heard as it goes eternally backwards and forwards," sobbed
out Ruth, as she threw herself on her bed, without even undressing herself.</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, Ruth, you know it won't be always as it has been to-night. We often
get to bed by ten o'clock, and by-and-by you won't mind the closeness of
the room. You're worn-out to-night, or you would not have minded the sound
of the needle; I never hear it. Come, let me unfasten you," said Jenny.</DD>

<DD>
"What is the use of undressing? We must be up again and at work in three
hours."</DD>

<DD>
"And in those three hours you may get a great deal of rest, if you will
but undress yourself and fairly go to bed. Come, love."</DD>

<DD>
Jenny's advice was not resisted; but before Ruth went to sleep she said--</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I wish I was not so cross and impatient. I don't think I used to be."</DD>

<DD>
"No, I am sure not. Most new girls get impatient at first; but it goes
off, and they don't care much for anything after a while. Poor child! she's
asleep already," said Jenny to herself.</DD>

<DD>
She could not sleep or rest. The tightness at her side was worse than usual.
She almost thought she ought to mention it in her letters home; but then
she remembered the premium her father had struggled hard to pay, and the
large family, younger than herself, that had to be cared for, and she determined
to bear on, and trust that, when the warm weather came, both the pain and
the cough would go away. She would be prudent about herself.</DD>

<DD>
What was the matter with Ruth? She was crying in her sleep as if her heart
would break. Such agitated slumber could be no rest; so Jenny wakened her.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth! Ruth!"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Jenny!" said Ruth, sitting up in bed, and pushing back the masses
of hair that were heating her forehead, "I thought I saw mamma by the side
of the bed, coming as she used to do, to see if I were asleep and comfortable;
and when I tried to take hold of her, she went away and left me alone--I
don't know where; so strange!"</DD>

<DD>
"It was only a dream; you know you'd been talking about her to me, and
you're feverish with sitting up late. Go to sleep again, and I'll watch,
and waken you if you seem uneasy."</DD>

<DD>
"But you'll be so tired. Oh, dear! dear!" Ruth was asleep again, even while
she sighed.</DD>

<DD>
Morning came, and though their rest had been short, the girls arose refreshed.</DD>

<DD>
"Miss Sutton, Miss Jennings, Miss Booth, and Miss Hilton, you will see
that you are ready to accompany me to the shire-hall by eight o'clock."</DD>

<DD>
One or two of the girls looked astonished, but the majority, having anticipated
the selection, and knowing from experience the unexpressed rule by which
it was made, received it with the sullen indifference which had become
their feeling with regard to most events--a deadened sense of life, consequent
upon their unnatural mode of existence, their sedentary days, and their
frequent nights of late watching.</DD>

<DD>
But to Ruth it was inexplicable. She had yawned, and loitered, and looked
off at the beautiful panel, and lost herself in thoughts of home, until
she fully expected the reprimand which at any other time she would have
been sure to receive, and now, to her surprise, she was singled out as
one of the most diligent!</DD>

<DD>
Much as she longed for the delight of seeing the noble shire-hall--the
boast of the county--and of catching glimpses of the dancers, and hearing
the band; much as she longed for some variety to the dull, monotonous life
she was leading, she could not feel happy to accept a privilege, granted,
as she believed, in ignorance of the real state of the case; so she startled
her companions by rising abruptly and going up to Mrs. Mason, who was finishing
a dress which ought to have been sent home two hours before--</DD>

<DD>
"If you please, Mrs. Mason, I was not one of the most diligent; I am afraid--I
believe--I was not diligent at all. I was very tired; and I could not help
thinking, and, when I think, I can't attend to my work." She stopped, believing
she had sufficiently explained her meaning; but Mrs. Mason would not understand,
and did not wish for any further elucidation.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, my dear, you must learn to think and work, too; or, if you can't
do both, you must leave off thinking. Your guardian, you know, expects
you to make great progress in your business, and I am sure you won't disappoint
him."</DD>

<DD>
But that was not to the point. Ruth stood still an instant, although Mrs.
Mason resumed her employment in a manner which any one but a "new girl"
would have known to be intelligible enough, that she did not wish for any
more conversation just then.</DD>

<DD>
"But as I was not diligent I ought not to go, ma'am. Miss Wood was far
more industrious than I, and many of the others."</DD>

<DD>
"Tiresome girl!" muttered Mrs. Mason; "I've half a mind to keep her at
home for plaguing me so." But, looking up, she was struck afresh with the
remarkable beauty which Ruth possessed; such a credit to the house, with
her waving outline of figure, her striking face, with dark eyebrows and
dark lashes, combined with auburn hair and a fair complexion. No I diligent
or idle, Ruth Hilton must appear to-night.</DD>

<DD>
"Miss Hilton," said Mrs. Mason, with stiff dignity "I am not accustomed
(as these young ladies can tell you) to have my decisions questioned. What
I say, I mean; and I have my reasons. So sit down, if you please, and take
care and be ready by eight. Not a word more," as she fancied she saw Ruth
again about to speak.</DD>

<DD>
"Jenny, you ought to have gone, not me," said Ruth, in no low voice to
Miss Wood, as she sat down by her.</DD>

<DD>
"Hush! Ruth. I could not go if I might, because of my cough. I would rather
give it up to you than any one if it were mine to give. And suppose it
is, then take the pleasure as my present, and tell me every bit about it
when you come home to-night."</DD>

<DD>
"Well! I shall take it in that way, and not as if I'd earned it, which
I haven't. So thank you. You can't think how I shall enjoy it now. I did
work diligently for five minutes last night, after I heard of it; I wanted
to go so much. But I could not keep it up. Oh, dear! and I shall really
hear a band! and see the inside of that beautiful shire-hall!"</DD>
