<DD>
Mr. Bellingham attended afternoon service at St. Nicholas' church the next
Sunday. His thoughts had been far more occupied by Ruth than hers by him,
although his appearance upon the scene of her life was more an event to
her than it was to him. He was puzzled by the impression she had produced
on him, though he did not in general analyse the nature of his feelings,
but simply enjoyed them with the delight which youth takes in experiencing
new and strong emotion.</DD>

<DD>
He was old compared to Ruth, but young as a man; hardly three-and-twenty.
The fact of his being an only child had given him, as it does to many,
a sort of inequality in those parts of the character which are usually
formed by the number of years that a person has lived.</DD>

<DD>
The unevenness of discipline to which only children are subjected; the
thwarting, resulting from over-anxiety; the indiscreet indulgence, arising
from a love centred all in one object--had been exaggerated in his education,
probably from the circumstance that his mother (his only surviving parent)
had been similarly situated to himself.</DD>

<DD>
He was already in possession of the comparatively small property he inherited
from his father. The estate on which his mother lived was her own; and
her income gave her the means of indulging or controlling him, after he
had grownto man's estate, as her wayward disposition and her love of power
prompted her.</DD>

<DD>
Had he been double-dealing in his conduct towards her, had he condescended
to humour her in the least, her passionate love for him would have induced
her to strip herself of all her possessions to add to his dignity or happiness.
But although he felt the warmest affection for her, the regardlessness
which she had taught him (by example, perhaps, more than by precept) of
the feelings of others, was continually prompting him to do things that
she, for the time being, resented as mortal affronts. He would mimic the
clergyman she specially esteemed, even to his very face; he would refuse
to visit her schools for months and months; and, when wearied into going
at last, revenge himself by puzzling the children with the most ridiculous
questions (gravely put) that he could imagine.</DD>

<DD>
All these boyish tricks annoyed and irritated her far more than the accounts
which reached her of more serious misdoings at college and in town. Of
these grave offences she never spoke; of the smaller misdeeds she hardly
ever ceased speaking.</DD>

<DD>
Still, at times, she had great influence over him, and nothing delighted
her more than to exercise it. The submission of his will to hers was sure
to be liberally rewarded; for it gave her great happiness to extort, from
his indifference or his affection, the concessions which she never sought
by force of reason, or by appeals to principle--concessions which he frequently
withheld, solely for the sake of asserting his independence of her control.</DD>

<DD>
She was anxious for him to marry Miss Duncombe. He cared little or nothing
about it--it was time enough to be married ten years hence; and so he was
dawdling through some months of his life--sometimes flirting with the nothing-loth
Miss Duncombe, sometimes plaguing, and sometimes delighting his mother,
at all times taking care to please himself--when he first saw Ruth Hilton,
and a new, passionate, hearty feeling shot through his whole being. He
did not know why he was so fascinated by her. She was very beautiful, but
he had seen others equally beautiful, and with many more <I>agaceries</I>
calculated to set off the effect of their charms.</DD>

<DD>
There was, perhaps, something bewitching in the union of the grace and
loveliness of womanhood with the <I>naivete</I>, simplicity, and innocence
of an intelligent child. There was a spell in the shyness, which made her
avoid and shun all admiring approaches to acquaintance. It would be an
exquisite delight to attract and tame her wildness, just as he had often
allured and tamed the timid fawns in his mother's park.</DD>

<DD>
By no over-bold admiration, or rash, passionate word, would he startle
her; and, surely, in time she might be induced to look upon him as a friend,
if not something nearer and dearer still.</DD>

<DD>
In accordance with this determination, he resisted the strong temptation
of walking by her side the whole distance home after church. He only received
. the intelligence she brought respecting the panel with thanks, spoke
a few words about the weather, bowed, and was gone. Ruth believed she should
never see him again; and, in spite of sundry self-upbraidings for her folly,
she could not help feeling as if a shadow were drawn over her existence
for several days to come.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Mason was a widow, and had to struggle for th. sake of the six or
seven children left dependent on her exertions; thus there was some reason,
and great excuse, for the pinching economy which regulated her household
affairs.</DD>

<DD>
On Sundays she chose to conclude that all her apprentices had friends who
would be glad to see them to dinner, and give them a welcome reception
for the remainder of the day; while she, and those of her children who
were not at school, went to spend the day at her father's house, several
miles out of the town. Accordingly, no dinner was cooked on Sundays for
the young workwomen; no fires were lighted in any rooms to which they had
access. On this morning they breakfasted in Mrs. Mason's own parlour, after
which the room was closed against them through the day by some understood,
though unspoken prohibition.</DD>

<DD>
What became of such as Ruth, who had no home and no friends in that large,
populous, desolate town? She had hitherto commissioned the servant, who
went to market on Saturdays for the family, to buy her a bun or biscuit,
whereon she made her fasting dinner in the deserted workroom, sitting in
her walking-dress to keep off the cold, which clung to her in spite of
shawl and bonnet. Then she would sit at the window, looking out on the
dreary prospect till her eyes were often blinded by tears; and, partly
to shake off thoughts and recollections, the indulgence in which she felt
to be productive of no good, and partly to have some ideas to dwell upon
during the coming week beyond those suggested by the constant view of the
same room she would carry her Bible, and place herself upon the window-seat
on the wide landing, which commanded the street in front of the house.
From thence she could see the irregular grandeur of the place; she caught
a view of the grey church-tower, rising hoary and massive into mid-air;
she saw one or two figures loiter along on the sunny side of the street,
in all the enjoyment of their fine clothes and Sunday leisure; and she
imagined histories for them, and tried to picture to herself their homes
and their daily doings.</DD>

<DD>
And, before long, the bells swung heavily in the church-tower, and struck
out with musical clang the first summons to afternoon church.</DD>

<DD>
After church was over, she used to return home to the same window-seat,
and watch till the winter twilight was over and gone, and the stars came
out over the black masses of houses. And then she would steal down to ask
for a candle, as a companion to her in the deserted workroom. Occasionally
the servant would bring her up some tea; but of late Ruth had declined
taking any, as she had discovered she was robbing the kind-hearted creature
of part of the small provision left out for her by Mrs. Mason. She sat
on, hungry and cold, trying to read her Bible, and to think the old holy
thoughts which had been her childish meditations at her mother's knee,
until one after another the apprentices returned, weary with their day's
enjoyment and their week's late watching; too weary to make her in any
way a partaker of their pleasure by entering into details of the manner
in which they had spent their day.</DD>

<DD>
And, last of all, Mrs. Mason returned; and, summoning her "young people"
once more into the parlour, she read a prayer before dismissing them to
bed. She always expected to find them all in the house when she came home,
but asked no questions as to their proceedings through the day; perhaps
because she dreaded to hear that one or two had occasionally nowhere to
go to, and that it would be sometimes necessary to order a Sunday's dinner,
and leave a lighted fire on that day.</DD>

<DD>
For five months Ruth had been an inmate at Mrs. Mason's; and such had been
the regular order of the Sundays. While the forewoman stayed there, it
is true, she was ever ready to give Ruth the little variety of hearing
of recreations in which she was no partaker; and, however tired Jenny might
be at night, she had ever some sympathy to bestow on Ruth for the dull
length of day she had passed. After her departure, the monotonous idleness
of the Sunday seemed worse to bear than the incessant labour of the work-days;
until the time came when it seemed to be a recognised hope in her mind,
that on Sunday afternoons she should see Mr. Bellingham, and hear a few
words from him as from a friend who took an interest in her thoughts and
proceedings during the past week.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth's mother had been the daughter of a poor curate in Norfolk, and, early
left without parents or home, she was thankful to marry a respectable farmer
a good deal older than herself. After their marriage, however, everything
seemed to go wrong. Mrs. Hilton fell into a delicate state of health, and
was unable to bestow the ever-watchful attention to domestic affairs so
requisite in a farmer's wife. Her husband had a series of misfortunes--of
a more important kind than the death of a whole brood of turkeys from getting
among the nettles, or the year of bad cheeses spoilt by a careless dairymaid--which
were the consequences (so the neighbours said) of Mr. Hilton's mistake
in marrying a delicate fine lady. His crops failed; his horses died; his
barn took fire: in short, if he had been in any way a remarkable character,
one might have supposed him to be the object of an avenging fate, so successive
were the evils which pursued him; but, as he was only a somewhat commonplace
farmer, I believe we must attribute his calamities to some want in his
character of the one quality required to act as keystone to many excellences.
While his wife lived, all worldly misfortunes seemed as nothing to him;
her strong sense and lively faculty of hope upheld him from despair; her
sympathy was always ready, and the invalid's room had an atmosphere of
peace and encouragement which affected all who entered it. But when Ruth
was about twelve, one morning in the busy hay-time, Mrs. Hilton was left
alone for some hours. This had often happened before, nor had she seemed
weaker than usual when they had gone forth to the field; but on their return,
with merry voices, to fetch the dinner prepared for the haymakers, they
found an unusual silence brooding over the house; no low voice called out
gently to welcome them, and ask after the day's progress; and, on entering
the little parlour, which was called Mrs. Hilton's, and was sacred to her,
they found her lying dead on her accustomed sofa. Quite calm and peaceful
she lay; there had been no struggle at last; the struggle was for the survivors,
and one sank under it. Her husband did not make much ado at first--at least,
not in outward show; her memory seemed to keep in check all external violence
of grief; but, day by day, dating from his wife's death, his mental powers
decreased. He was still a hale-looking elderly man, and his bodily health
appeared as good as ever; but he sat for hours in his easy-chair, looking
into the fire, not moving, nor speaking, unless when it was absolutely
necessary to answer repeated questions. If Ruth, with coaxings and draggings,
induced him to come out with her, he went with measured steps around his
fields, his head bent to the ground with the same abstracted, unseeing
look; never smiling-never changing the expression of his face, not even
to one of deeper sadness, when anything occurred which might be supposed
to remind him of his dead wife. But, in this abstraction from all outward
things, his worldly affairs went ever lower down. He paid money away, or
received it, as if it had been so' much water; the gold mines of Potosi
could not have touched the deep grief of his soul; but God in in His mercy
knew the sure balm, and sent the Beautiful Messenger to take the weary
one home.</DD>

<DD>
After his death, the creditors were the chief people who appeared to take
any interest in the affairs; and it seemed strange to Ruth to see people,
whom she scarcely knew, examining and touching all that she had been accustomed
to consider as precious and sacred. Her father had made his will at her
birth. With the pride of newly and late-acquired paternity, he had considered
the office of guardian to his little darling as one which would have been
an additional honour to the lord-lieutenant of the county; but as he had
not the pleasure of his lordship's acquaintance, he selected the person
of most consequence amongst those whom he did know; not any very ambitious
appointment in those days of comparative prosperity; but certainly the
flourishing maltster of Skelton was a little surprised, when, fifteen years
later, he learnt that he was executor to a will bequeathing many vanished
hundreds of pounds, and guardian to a young girl whom he could not remember
ever to have seen.</DD>

<DD>
He was a sensible, hard-headed man of the world; having a very fair proportion
of conscience as consciences go; indeed, perhaps more than many people;
for he had some ideas of duty extending to the circle beyond his own family,
and did not, as some would have done, decline acting altogether, but speedily
summoned the creditors, examined into the accounts, sold up the farming-stock,
and discharged all the debts; paid about &pound;80 into the Skelton bank
for a week, while he inquired for a situation or apprenticeship of some
kind for poor heart-broken Ruth; heard of Mrs. Mason's; arranged all with
her in two short conversations; drove over for Ruth in his gig; waited
while she and the old servant packed up her clothes; and grew very impatient
while she ran, with her eyes streaming with tears, round the garden, tearing
off in a passion of love whole boughs of favourite China and damask roses,
late flowering against the casement-window of what had been her mother's
room. When she took her seat in the gig, she was little able, even if she
had been inclined, to profit by her guardian's lectures on economy and
self-reliance; but she was quiet and silent, looking forward with longing
to the night-time, when, in her bedroom, she might give way to all her
passionate sorrow at being wrenched from the home where she had lived with
her parents, in that utter absence of any anticipation of change, which
is either the blessing or the curse of childhood. But at night there were
four other girls in her room, and she could not cry before them. She watched
and waited till, one by one, they dropped off to sleep, and then she buried
her face in the pillow, and shook with sobbing grief; and then she paused
to conjure up, with fond luxuriance, every recollection of the happy days,
so little valued in their uneventful peace while they lasted, so passionately
regretted when once gone for ever; to remember every look and word of the
dear mother, and to moan afresh over the change caused by her death--the
first clouding in of Ruth's day of life. It was Jenny's sympathy on this
first night, when awakened by Ruth's irrepressible agony, that had made
the bond between them. But Ruth's loving disposition, continually sending
forth fibres in search of nutriment, found no other object for regard among
those of her daily life to compensate for the want of natural ties.</DD>

<DD>
But, almost insensibly, Jenny's place in Ruth's heart was filled up; there
was some one who listened with tender interest to all her little revelations;
who questioned her about her early days of happiness, and, in return, spoke
of his own childhood--not so golden in reality as Ruth's, but more dazzling,
when recounted with stories of the beautiful cream-coloured Arabian pony,
and the old picture-gallery in the house, and avenues, and terraces, and
fountains in the garden, for Ruth to paint, with all the vividness of imagination,
as scenery and background for the figure which was growing by slow degrees
most prominent in her thoughts.</DD>

<DD>
It must not be supposed that this was affected all at once, though the
intermediate stages have been passed over. On Sunday, Mr. Bellingham only
spoke to her to receive the information about the panel; nor did he come
to St. Nicholas' the next, nor yet the following Sunday. But the third
he walked by her side a little way, and, seeing her annoyance, he left
her; and then she wished for him back again, and found the day very dreary,
and wondered why a strange, undefined feeling, had made her imagine she
was doing wrong in walking alongside of one so kind and good as Mr. Bellingham;
it had been very foolish of her to he self-conscious all the time, and
if ever he spoke to her again she would not think of what people might
say, but enjoy the pleasure which his kind words and evident interest in
her might give. Then she thought it was very likely he never would notice
her again, for she knew she had been very rude with her short answers;
it was very provoking that she had behaved so rudely. She sould be sixteen
in another month, and she was still childish and awkward. Thus she lectured
herself, after parting with Mr. Bellingham; and the consequence was, that
on the following Sunday she was ten times as blushing and conscious, and
(Mr. Bellingham thought) ten times more beautiful than ever. He suggested
that, instead of going straight home through High Street, she should take
the round by the Leasowes; at first she declined, but then, suddenly wondering
and questioning herself why she refused a thing which was, as far as reason
and knowledge (<I>her</I> knowledge) went, so innocent, and which was certainly
so tempting and pleasant, she agreed to go the round; and, when she was
once in the meadows that skirted the town, she forgot all doubt and awkwardness--nay,
almost forgot the presence of Mr. Bellingham--in her delight at the new,
tender beauty of an early spring day in February. Among the last year's
brown ruins, heaped together by the wind in the hedgerows, she found the
fresh, green, crinkled leaves and pale star-like flowers of the primroses.
Here and there a golden celandine made brilliant the sides of the little
brook that (full of water in "February fill-dyke") bubbled along by the
side of the path; the sun was low in the horizon, and once, when they came
to a higher part of the Leasowes, Ruth burst into an exclamation of delight
at the evening glory of mellow light which was in the sky behind the purple
distance, while the brown leafless woods in the foreground derived an almost
metallic lustre from the golden mist and haze of sunset. It was but three-quarters
of a mile round by the meadows, but somehow it took them an hour to walk
it. Ruth turned to thank Mr. Bellingham for his kindness in taking her
home by this beautiful way, but his look of admiration at her glowing,
animated face, made her suddenly silent; and, hardly wishing him good-bye,
she quickly entered the house with a beating, happy, agitated heart.</DD>

<DD>
"How strange it is," she thought that evening, "that I should feel as if
this charming afternoon's walk were, somehow, not exactly wrong, but yet
as if it were not right. Why can it be? I am not defrauding Mrs. Mason
of any of her time; that I know would be wrong; I am left to go where I
like on Sundays. I have been to church, so it can't be because I have missed
doing my duty. If I had gone this walk with Jenny, I wonder whether I should
have felt as I do now. There must be something wrong in me, myself, to
feel so guilty when I have done nothing which is not right; and yet I can
thank God for the happiness I have had in this charming spring walk, which
dear mamma used to say was a sign when pleasures were innocent and good
for us."</DD>

<DD>
She was not conscious, as yet, that Mr. Bellingham's presence had added
any charm to the ramble; and when she might have become aware of this,
as, week after week, Sunday after Sunday, loitering ramble after loitering
ramble succeeded each other, she was too much absorbed with one set of
thoughts to have much inclination for self-questioning.</DD>

<DD>
"Tell me everything, Ruth, as you would to a brother; let me help you,
if I can, in your difficulties," he said to her one afternoon. And he really
did try to understand, and to realise, how an insignificant and paltry
person like Mason the dressmaker could be an object of dread, and regarded
as a person having authority, by Ruth. He flamed up with indignation when,
by way of impressing him with Mrs. Mason's power and consequence, Ruth
spoke of some instance of the effects of her employer's displeasure. He
declared his mother should never have a gown made again by such a tyrant--such
a Mrs. Brownrigg; that he would prevent all his acquaintances from going
to such a cruel dressmaker; till Ruth was alarmed at the threatened consequences
of her one-sided account, and pleaded for Mrs. Mason as earnestly as if
a young man's menace of this description were likely to be literally fulfilled.</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, sir, I have been very wrong; if you please, sir, don't be so angry.
She is often very good to us; it is only sometimes she goes into a passion:
and we are very provoking, I dare say. I know I am for one. I have often
to undo my work, and you can't think how it spoils anything (particularly
silk) to be unpicked; and Mrs. Mason has to bear all the blame. Oh! I am
sorry I said anything about it. Don't speak to your mother about it, pray,
sir. Mrs. Mason thinks so much of Mrs. Bellingham's custom."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I won't this time"--recollecting that there might be some awkwardness
in accounting to his mother for the means by which he had obtained his
very correct information as to what passed in Mrs. Mason's workroom--"but,
if ever she does so again, I'll not answer for myself."</DD>

<DD>
"I will take care and not tell again, sir," said Ruth, in a low voice.</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, Ruth, you are not going to have secrets from me, are you? Don't you
remember your promise to consider me as a brother? Go on telling me everything
that happens to you, pray; you cannot think how much interest I take in
all your interests. I can quite fancy that charming home at Milham you
told me about last Sunday. I can almost fancy Mrs. Mason's workroom; and
that, surely, is a proof either of the strength of my imagination, or of
your powers of description."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth smiled. "It is, indeed, sir. Our workroom must be so different to
anything you ever saw. I think you must have passed through Milham often
on your way to Lowford."</DD>

<DD>
"Then you don't think it is any stretch of fancy to have so clear an idea
as I have of Milham Grange? On the left hand of the road, is it, Ruth?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, sir, just over the bridge, and up the hill where the elm-trees meet
overhead and make a green shade; and then comes the dear old Grange, that
I shall never see again."</DD>

<DD>
"Never! Nonsense, Ruthie; it is only six miles off; you may see it any
day. It is not an hour's ride."</DD>

<DD>
"Perhaps I may see it again when I am grown old; I did not think exactly
what 'never' meant; it is so very long since I was there, and I don't see
any chance of my going for years and years at any rate."</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Ruth, you--we may go next Sunday afternoon, if you like."</DD>

<DD>
She looked up at him with a lovely light of pleasure in her face at the
idea. "How, sir? Can I walk it between afternoon-service and the time Mrs.
Mason comes home? I would go for only one glimpse; but if I could get into
the house--oh, sir! if I could just see mamma's room again!"</DD>

<DD>
He was revolving plans in his head for giving her this pleasure, and he
had also his own in view. If they went in any of his carriages, the loitering
charm of the walk would be lost; and they must, to a certain degree, be
encumbered by, and exposed to the notice of servants.</DD>

<DD>
"Are you a good walker, Ruth? Do you think you can manage six miles? If
we set off at two o'clock, we shall be there by four, without hurrying;
or say half-past four. Then we might stay two hours, and you could show
me all the old walks and old places you love, and we could still come leisurely
home. Oh, it's all arranged directly!"</DD>

<DD>
"But do you think it would be right, sir? It seems as if it would be such
a great pleasure, that it must be in some way wrong."</DD>

<DD>
"Why, you little goose, what can be wrong in it?"</DD>

<DD>
"In the first place, I miss going to church by setting out at two," said
Ruth, a little gravely.</DD>

<DD>
"Only for once. Surely you don't see any harm in missing church for once?
You will go in the morning, you know."</DD>

<DD>
"I wonder if Mrs. Mason would think it right--if she would allow it?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, I dare say not. But you don't mean to be governed by Mrs. Mason's
notions of right and wrong. She thought it right to treat that poor girl
Palmer in the way you told me about. You would think that wrong, you know,
and so would every one of sense and feeling. Come, Ruth, don't pin your
faith on any one, but judge for yourself. The pleasure is perfectly innocent:
it is not a selfish pleasure either, for I shall enjoy it to the full as
much as you will. I shall like to see the places where you spent your childhood;
I shall almost love them as much as you do." He had dropped his voice;
and spoke in low, persuasive tones. Ruth hung down her head, and blushed
with exceeding happiness; but she could not speak, even to urge her doubts
afresh. Thus it was in a manner settled.</DD>

<DD>
How delightfully happy the plan made her through the coming week! She was
too young when her mother died to have received any cautions or words of
advice respecting <I>the</I> subject of a woman's life--if, indeed, wise
parents ever directly speak of what, in its depth and power, cannot be
put into words--which is a brooding spirit with no definite form or shape
that men should know it, but which is there, and present before we have
recognised and realised its existence. Ruth was innocent and snow-pure.
She had heard of falling in love, but did not know the signs and symptoms
thereof; nor, indeed, had she troubled her head much about them. Sorrow
had filled up her days, to the exclusion of all lighter thoughts than the
consideration of present duties, and the remembrance of the happy time
which had been. But the interval of blank, after the loss of her mother
and during her father's life-in-death, had made her all the more ready
to value and cling to sympathy--first from Jenny, and now from Mr. Bellingham.
To see her home again, and to see it with him; to show him (secure of his
interest) the haunts of former times, each with its little tale of the
past--of dead-and-gone events!--No coming shadow threw its gloom over this
week's dream of happiness--a dream which was too bright to be spoken about
to common and indifferent ears.</DD>
