Sally and Miss Benson took it in turns to sit up, or rather, they took
it in turns to nod by the fire; for if Ruth was awake she lay very still
in the moonlight calm of her sick bed. That time resembled a beautiful
August evening, such as I have seen. The white, snowy rolling mist covers
up under its great sheet all trees and meadows, and tokens of earth; but
it cannot rise high enough to shut out the heavens, which on such nights
seem bending very near, and to be the only real and present objects; and
so near, so real and present, did heaven, and eternity, and God seem to
Ruth, as she lay encircling her mysterious holy child.</DD>

<DD>
One night Sally found out she was not asleep.</DD>

<DD>
"I'm a rare hand at talking folks to sleep," said she. "I'll try on thee,
for thou must get strength by sleeping and eating. What must I talk to
thee about, I wonder. Shall I tell thee a love story or a fairy story,
such as I've telled Master Thurstan many a time and many a time, for all
his father set his face again fairies, and called it vain talking; or shall
I tell you the dinner I once cooked, when Mr. Harding, as was Miss Faith's
sweetheart, came unlooked for, and we'd nought in the house but a neck
of mutton, out of which I made seven dishes, all with a different name?"</DD>

<DD>
"Who was Mr. Harding?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, he was a grand gentleman from Lunnon, as had seen Miss Faith, and
been struck by her pretty looks when she was out on a visit, and came here
to ask her to marry him. She said, 'No, she would never leave Master Thurstan,
as could never marry;' but she pined a deal at after he went away. She
kept up afore Master Thurstan, but I seed her fretting, though I never
let on that I did, for I thought she'd soonest get over it and be thankful
at after she'd the strength to do right. However, I've no business to be
talking of Miss Benson's concerns. I'll tell you of my own sweethearts
and welcome, or I'll tell you of the dinner, which was the grandest thing
I ever did in my life, but I thought a Lunnoner should never think country
folks knew nothing; and, my word, I puzzled him with his dinner. I'm doubting
whether to this day he knows whether what he was eating was fish, flesh,
or fowl. Shall I tell you how I managed?"</DD>

<DD>
But Ruth said she would rather hear about Sally's sweethearts; much to
the disappointment of the latter, who considered the dinner by far the
greatest achievement.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, you see, I don't know as I should call them sweethearts; for excepting
John Rawson, who was shut up in a mad-house the next week, I never had
what you may call a downright offer of marriage but once. But I had once;
and so I may say I had a sweetheart. I was beginning to be afeard though,
for one likes to be axed; that's but civility; and I remember, after I
had turned forty, and afore Jeremiah Dixon had spoken, I began to think
John Rawson had perhaps not been so very mad, and that I'd done ill to
lightly his offer, as a madman's, if it was to be the only one I was ever
to have; I don't mean as I'd have had him, but I thought, if it was to
come o'er again, I'd speak respectful of him to folk, and say it were only
his way to go about on all-fours, but that he was a sensible man in most
things. However I'd had my laugh, and so had others, at my crazy lover,
and it was late now to set him up as a Solomon. However, I thought it would
be no bad thing to be tried again; but I little thought the trial would
come when it did. You see, Saturday night is a leisure night in counting-houses
and such-like places, while it's the busiest of all for servants. Well!
it was a Saturday night, and I'd my baize apron on, and the tails of my
bed-gown pinned together behind, down on my knees, pipeclaying the kitchen,
when a knock comes to the back door. 'Come in!' says I; but it knocked
again, as if it were too stately to open the door for itself; so I got
up rather cross, and opened the door; and there stood Jerry Dixon, Mr.
Holt's head-clerk; only he was not head-clerk then. So I stood, stopping
up the door, fancying he wanted to speak to master; but he kind of pushed
past me, and telling me summut about the weather (as if I could not see
it for myself), he took a chair, and sat down by the oven. 'Cool and easy!'
thought I; meaning hisself, not his place, which I knew must be pretty
hot. Well! it seemed no use standing waiting for my gentleman to go; not
that he had much to say either; but he kept twirling his hat round and
round, and smoothing the nap on't with the back of his hand. So at last
I squatted down to my work, and thinks I, I shall be on my knees all ready
if he puts up a prayer, for I knew he was a Methodee by bringing-up, and
had only lately turned to master's way of thinking; and them Methodees
are terrible hands at unexpected prayers when one least looks for 'em.
I can't say I like their way of taking one by surprise, as it were; but
then I'm a parish-clerk's daughter, and could never demean myself to dissenting
fashions, always save and except Master Thurstan's, bless him. However,
I'd been caught once or twice unawares, so this time I thought I'd be up
to it, and I moved a dry duster wherever I went, to kneel upon in case
he began when I were in a wet place. By-and-by I thought, if the man would
pray it would be a blessing, for it would prevent his sending his eyes
after me wherever I went; for when they takes to praying they shuts their
eyes, and quivers th' lids in a queer kind o' way--them Dissenters does.
I can speak pretty plain to you, for you're bred in the Church like mysel',
and must find it as out o' the way as I do to be among dissenting folk.
God forbid I should speak disrespectful of Master Thurstan and Miss Faith,
though; I never think on them as Church or Dissenters, but just as Christians.
But to come back to Jerry. First, I tried always to be cleaning at his
back; but when he wheeled round, so as always to face me, I thought I'd
try a different game. So, says I, 'Master Dixon, I ax your pardon, but
I must pipeclay under your chair. Will you please to move?' Well, he moved;
and by-and-by I was at him again with the same words; and at after that,
again and again, till he were always moving about wi' his chair behind
him, like a snail as carries its house on its back. And the great gaupus
never seed that I were pipeclaying the same places twice over. At last
I got desperate cross, he were so in my way; so I made two big crosses
on the tails of his brown coat; for you see, wherever he went, up or down,
he drew out the tails of his coat from under him, and stuck them through
the bars of the chair; and flesh and blood could not resist pipeclaying
them for him; and a pretty brushing he'd have, I reckon, to get it off
again. Well! at length he clears his throat uncommon loud; so I spreads
my duster, and shuts my eyes all ready; but when nought comed of it, I
opened my eyes a little bit to see what he were about. My word! if there
he wasn't down on his knees right facing me, staring as bard as he could.
Well! I thought it would be hard work to stand that, if he made a long
ado; so I shut my eyes again, and tried to think serious, as became what
I fancied were coming; but forgive me! but I thought why couldn't the fellow
go in and pray wi' Master Thurstan, as had always a calm spirit ready for
prayer, instead o' me who had my dresser to scour, let alone an apron to
iron. At last he says, says he, 'Sally! will you oblige me with your hand?'
So I thought it were, maybe, Methodee fashion to pray hand in hand; and
I'll not deny but I wished I'd washed it better after blackleading the
kitchen fire. I thought I'd better tell him it were not so clean as I could
wish, so says I, 'Master Dixon, you shall have it, and welcome, if I may
just go and wash 'em first.' But, says he, 'My dear Sally, dirty or clean,
it's all the same to me, seeing I'm only speaking in a figuring way. What
I'm asking on my bended knees is, that you'd please to be so kind as to
be my wedded wife; week after next will suit me, if it's agreeable to you!'
My word! I were up on my feet in an instant! It were odd now, weren't it?
I never thought of taking the fellow, and getting married; for all, I'll
not deny, I had been thinking it would be agreeable to be axed. But all
at once, I couldn't abide the chap. 'Sir,' says I, trying to look shamefaced
as became the occasion, but for all that feeling a twittering round my
mouth that I were afeard might end in a laugh--'Master Dixon, I'm obleeged
to you for the compliment, and thank ye all the same, but I think I'd prefer
a single life.' He looked mighty taken aback; but in a minute he cleared
up, and was as sweet as ever. He still kept on his knees, and I wished
he'd take himself up; but, I reckon, he thought it would give force to
his words; says he, 'Think again, my dear Sally. I've a four-roomed house,
and furniture conformable; and eighty pound a year. You may never have
such a chance again.' There were truth enough in that, but it was not pretty
in the man to say it; and it put me up a bit. 'As for that, neither you
nor I can tell, Master Dixon. You're not the first chap as I've had down
on his knees afore me, axing me to marry him (you see I were thinking of
John Rawson, only I thought there were no need to say he were on all-fours--it
were truth he were on his knees, you know), and maybe you'll not be the
last. Anyhow, I've no wish to change my condition just now.' 'I'll wait
till Christmas,' says he. 'I've a pig as will be ready for killing then,
so I must get married before that.' Well now! would you believe it? the
pig was a temptation. I'd a receipt for curing hams, as Miss Faith would
never let me try, saying the old way were good enough. However, I resisted.
Says I, very stern, because I felt I'd been wavering, 'Master Dixon, once
for all, pig or no pig, I'll not marry you. And if you'll take my advice,
you'll get up off your knees. The flags is but damp yet, and it would be
an awkward thing to have rheumatiz just before winter.' With that he got
up, stiff enough. He looked as sulky a chap as ever I clapped eyes on.
And as he were so black and cross, I thought I'd done well (whatever came
of the pig) to say 'No' to him. 'You may live to repent this,' says he,
very red. 'But I'll not be hard upon ye, I'll give you another chance.
I'll let you have the night to think about it, and I'll just call in to
hear your second thoughts, after chapel, to-morrow.' Well now! did ever
you hear the like! But that is the way with all of them men, thinking so
much of theirselves, and that it's but ask and have. They've never had
me, though; and I shall be sixty-one next Martinmas, so there's not much
time left for them to try me, I reckon. Well! when Jeremiah said that he
put me up more than ever, and I says, 'My first thoughts, second thoughts,
and third thoughts is all one and the same; you've but tempted me once,
and that was when you spoke of your pig. But of yoursel' you're nothing
to boast on, and so I'll bid you good night, and I'll keep my manners,
or else, if I told the truth, I should say it had been a great loss of
time listening to you. But I'll be civil--so good night.' He never said
a word, but went off as black as thunder, slamming the door after him.
The master called me in to prayers, but I can't say I could put my mind
to them, for my heart was beating so. However, it was a comfort to have
had an offer of holy matrimony; and though it flustered me, it made me
think more of myself. In the night, I began to wonder if I'd not been cruel
and hard to him. You see, I were feverish-like; and the old song of Barbary
Allen would keep running in my head, and I thought I were Barbary, and
he were young Jemmy Gray, and that maybe he'd die for love of me; and I
pictured him to mysel', lying on his death-bed, with his face turned to
the wall 'wi' deadly sorrow sighing,' and I could ha' pinched mysel' for
having been so like cruel Barbary Allen. And when I got up next day, I
found it hard to think on the real Jerry Dixon I had seen the night before,
apart from the sad and sorrowful Jerry I thought on a-dying, when I were
between sleeping and waking. And for many a day I turned sick, when I heard
the passing bell, for I thought it were the bell loud-knelling which were
to break my heart wi' a sense of what I'd missed in saying 'No' to Jerry,
and so Idling him with cruelty. But in less than a three week, I heard
parish bells a-ringing merrily for a wedding; and in the course of the
morning, some one says to me, 'Hark! how the bells is ringing for Jerry
Dixon's wedding!' And, all on a sudden, he changed back again from a heart-broken
young fellow, like Jemmy Gray, into a stout, middle-aged man, ruddy-complexioned,
with a wart on his left cheek like life!"</DD>

<DD>
Sally waited for some exclamation at the conclusion of her tale; but receiving
none, she stepped softly to the bedside, and there lay Ruth, peaceful as
death, with her baby on her breast.</DD>

<DD>
"I thought I'd lost some of my gifts if I could not talk a body to sleep,"
said Sally, in a satisfied and self-complacent tone.</DD>

<DD>
Youth is strong and powerful, and makes a hard battle against sorrow. So
Ruth strove and strengthened, and her baby flourished accordingly; and
before the little celandines were out on the hedge-banks, or the white
violets had sent forth their fragrance from the border under the south
wall of Miss Benson's small garden, Ruth was able to carry her baby into
that sheltered place on sunny days.</DD>

<DD>
She often wished to thank Mr. Benson and his sister, but she did not know
how to tell the deep gratitude she felt, and therefore she was silent.
But they understood her silence well. One day, as she watched her sleeping
child, she spoke to Miss Benson, with whom she happened to be alone.</DD>

<DD>
"Do you know of any cottage where the people are clean, and where they
would not mind taking me in?" asked she.</DD>

<DD>
"Taking you in! What do you mean?" said Miss Benson, dropping her knitting,
in order to observe Ruth more closely.</DD>

<DD>
"I mean," said Ruth, "where I might lodge with my baby--any very poor place
would do, only it must be clean, or he might be ill."</DD>

<DD>
"And what in the world do you want to go and lodge in a cottage for?" said
Miss Benson indignantly.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth did not lift up her eyes, but she spoke with a firmness which showed
that she had considered the subject.</DD>

<DD>
"I think I could make dresses. I know I did not learn as much as I might,
but perhaps I might do for servants and people who are not particular."</DD>

<DD>
"Servants are as particular as any one," said Miss Benson, glad to lay
hold of the first objection that she could.</DD>

<DD>
"Well! somebody who would be patient with me," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Nobody is patient over an ill-fitting gown," put in Miss Benson. "There's
the stuff spoilt, and what not!"</DD>

<DD>
"Perhaps I could find plain work to do," said Ruth, very meekly. "That
I can do very well; mamma taught me, and I liked to learn from her. If
you would be so good, Miss Benson, you might tell people I could do plain
work very neatly, and punctually, and cheaply."</DD>

<DD>
"You'd get sixpence a day, perhaps," said Miss Benson "and who would take
care of baby, I should like to know? Prettily he'd be neglected, would
not he? Why, he'd have the croup and the typhus fever in no time, and be
burnt to ashes after."</DD>

<DD>
"I have thought of all. Look how he sleeps! Hush, darling;" for just at
this point he began to cry, and to show his determination to be awake,
as if in contradiction to his mother's words. Ruth took him up, and carried
him about the room while she went on speaking.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, just now I know he will not sleep; but very often he will, and in
the night he always does."</DD>

<DD>
"And so you'd work in the night and kill yourself, and leave your poor
baby an orphan. Ruth! I'm ashamed of you. Now, brother" (Mr. Benson had
just come in), "is not this too bad of Ruth? here she is planning to go
away and leave us, just as we--as I, at least--have grown so fond of baby,
and he's beginning to know me."</DD>

<DD>
"Where were you thinking of going to, Ruth?" interrupted Mr. Benson, with
mild surprise.</DD>

<DD>
"Anywhere to be near you and Miss Benson; in any poor cottage where I might
lodge very cheaply, and earn my livelihood by taking in plain sewing, and
perhaps a little dressmaking; and where I could come and see you and dear
Miss Benson sometimes and bring baby."</DD>

<DD>
"If he was not dead before then of some fever, or burn, or scald, poor
neglected child, or you had not worked yourself to death with never sleeping"
said Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson thought a minute or two, and then he spoke to Ruth--</DD>

<DD>
"Whatever you may do when this little fellow is a year old, and able to
dispense with some of a mother's care, let me beg you, Ruth, as a favour
to me--as a still greater favour to my sister, is it not, Faith?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; you may put it so if you like."</DD>

<DD>
"To stay with us," continued he, "till then. When baby is twelve months
old, we'll talk about it again, and very likely before then some opening
may be shown us. Never fear leading an idle life, Ruth. We'll treat you
as a daughter, and set you all the household tasks; and it is not for your
sake that we ask you to stay, but for this little dumb helpless child's:
and it is not for our sake that you must stay, but for his."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was sobbing.</DD>

<DD>
"I do not deserve your kindness," said she, in a broken voice; "I do not
deserve it."</DD>

<DD>
Her tears fell fast and soft like summer rain, but no further word was
spoken. Mr. Benson quietly passed on to make the inquiry for which he had
entered the room.</DD>

<DD>
But when there was nothing to decide upon, and no necessity for entering
upon any new course of action, Ruth's mind relaxed from its strung-up state.
She fell into trains of reverie, and mournful regretful recollections which
rendered her languid and tearful. This was noticed both by Miss Benson
and Sally, and as each had kind sympathies, and felt depressed when they
saw any one near them depressed, and as each, without much reasoning on
the cause or reason for such depression, felt irritated at the uncomfortable
state into which they themselves were thrown, they both resolved to speak
to Ruth on the next fitting occasion.</DD>

<DD>
Accordingly, one afternoon--the morning of that day had been spent by Ruth
in house-work, for she had insisted on Mr. Benson's words, and had taken
Miss Benson's share of the more active and fatiguing household duties,
but she went through them heavily, and as if her heart was far away--in
the afternoon when she was nursing her child, Sally, on coming into the
back parlour, found her there alone, and easily detected the fact that
she was crying.</DD>

<DD>
"Where's Miss Benson?" asked Sally gruffly.</DD>

<DD>
"Gone out with Mr. Benson," answered Ruth, with an absent sadness in her
voice and manner. Her tears, scarce checked while she spoke, began to fall
afresh; and as Sally stood and gazed she saw the babe look hack in his
mother's face, and his little lip begin to quiver, and his open blue eye
to grow overclouded, as with some mysterious sympathy with the sorrowful
face bent over him. Sally took him briskly from his mother's arms; Ruth
looked up in grave surprise, for in truth she had forgotten Sally's presence,
and the suddenness of the motion startled her.</DD>

<DD>
"My bonny boy! are they letting the salt tears drop on thy sweet face before
thou'rt weaned! Little somebody knows how to be a mother--I could make
a better myself. 'Dance, thumbkin, dance--dance, ye merry men every one.'
Ay, that's it! smile, my pretty. Any one but a child like thee," continued
she, turning to Ruth, "would have known better than to bring ill-luck on
thy babby by letting tears fall on its face before it was weaned. But thou'rt
not fit to have a babby, and so I've said many a time. I've a great mind
to buy thee a doll, and take thy babby mysel'."</DD>

<DD>
Sally did not look at Ruth, for she was too much engaged in amusing the
baby with the tassel of the string to the window-blind, or else she would
have seen the dignity which the mother's soul put into Ruth at that moment.
Sally was quelled into silence by the gentle composure, the self-command
over her passionate sorrow, which gave to Ruth an unconscious grandeur
of demeanour as she came up to the old servant.</DD>

<DD>
"Give him back to me, please. I did not know it brought ill-luck, or if
my heart broke I would not have let a tear drop on his face--I never will
again. Thank you, Sally," as the servant relinquished him to her who came
in the name of a mother. Sally watched Ruth's grave, sweet smile, as she
followed up Sally's play with the tassel, and imitated, with all the docility
inspired by love, every movement and sound which had amused her babe.</DD>

<DD>
"Thou'lt be a mother, after all," said Sally, with a kind of admiration
of the control which Ruth was exercising over herself. "But why talk of
thy heart breaking? I don't question thee about what's past and gone; but
now thou'rt wanting for nothing, nor thy child either; the time to come
is the Lord's and in His hands; and yet thou goest about a-sighing and
a-moaning in a way that I can't stand or thole."</DD>

<DD>
"What do I do wrong?" said Ruth; "I try to do all I can."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, in a way," said Sally, puzzled to know how to describe her meaning.
"Thou dost it--but there's a, right and a wrong way of setting about everything--and
to my thinking, the right way is to take a thing up heartily, if it is
only making a bed. Why! dear ah me, making a bed may be done after a Christian
fashion, I take it, or else what's to come of such as me in heaven, who've
had little enough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees
for set prayers? When I was a girl, and wretched enough about Master Thurstan,
and the crook on his back which came of the fall I gave him, I took to
praying and sighing, and giving up the world; and I thought it were wicked
to care for the flesh, so I made heavy puddings, and was careless about
dinner and the rooms, and thought I was doing my duty, though I did call
myself a miserable sinner. But one night, the old missus (Master Thurstan's
mother) came in, and sat down by me, as I was a-scolding myself, without
thinking of what I was saying; and, says she, 'Sally! what are you blaming
yourself about, and groaning over? We hear you in the parlour every night,
and it makes my heart ache.' 'Oh, ma'am,' says I, 'I'm a miserable sinner,
and I'm travailing in the new birth.' 'Was that the reason,' says she,
'why the pudding was so heavy to-day?' 'Oh, ma'am, ma'am,' said I, 'if
you would not think of the things of the flesh, but trouble yourself about
your immortal soul.' And I sat a-shaking my head to think about her soul.
'But,' says she, in her sweet dropping voice, 'I do try to think of my
soul every hour of the day, if by that you mean trying to do the will of
God, but we'll talk now about the pudding; Master Thurstan could not eat
it, and I know you'll be sorry for that.' Well! I was sorry, but I didn't
choose to say so, as she seemed to expect me; so says I, 'It's a pity to
see children brought up to care for things of the flesh;' and then I could
have bitten my tongue out, for the missus looked so grave, and I thought
of my darling little lad pining for want of his food. At last, says she,
'Sally, do you think God has put us into the world just to be selfish,
and do nothing but see after our own souls? or to help one another with
heart and hand, as Christ did to all who wanted help?' I was silent, for,
you see, she puzzled me. So she went on, 'What is that beautiful answer
in your Church catechism, Sally?' I were pleased to hear a Dissenter, as
I did not think would have done it, speak so knowledgeably about the catechism,
and she went on: '"to do my duty in that station of life unto which it
shall please God to call me;" well, your station is a servant and it is
as honourable as a king's, if you look at it right; you are to help and
serve others in one way, just as a king is to help others in another. Now
what way are you to help and serve, or to do your duty, in that station
of life unto which it has pleased God to call you? Did it answer God's
purpose, and serve Him, when the food was unfit for a child to eat, and
unwholesome for any one?' Well! I would not give it up, I was so pig-headed
about my soul; so says I, 'I wish folks would be content with locusts and
wild honey, and leave other folks in peace to work out their salvation;'
and I groaned out pretty loud to think of missus's soul. I often think
since she smiled a bit at me; but she said, 'Well, Sally, to-morrow, you
shall have time to work out your salvation; but as we have no locusts in
England, and I don't think they'd agree with Master Thurstan if we had,
I will come and make the pudding; but I shall try and do it well, not only
for him to like it, but because everything may be done in a right way or
a wrong; the right way is to do it as well as we can, as in God's sight;
the wrong is to do it in a self-seeking spirit, which either leads us to
neglect it to follow out some device of our own for our own ends, or to
give up too much time and thought to it both before and after the doing.'
Well! I thought of old missus's words this morning, when I saw you making
the beds. You sighed so, you could not half shake the pillows; your heart
was not in your work; and yet it was the duty God had set you, I reckon;
I know it's not the work parsons preach about; though I don't think they
go so far off the mark when they read, 'whatsoever thy hand findeth to
do, that do with all thy might.' Just try for a day to think of all the
odd jobs as to be done well and truly as in God's sight, not just slurred
over anyhow, and you'll go through them twice as cheerfully, and have no
thought to spare for sighing or crying."</DD>

<DD>
Sally bustled off to set on the kettle for tea, and felt half ashamed,
in the quiet of the kitchen, to think of the oration she had made in the
parlour. But she saw with much satisfaction, that henceforward Ruth nursed
her boy with a vigour and cheerfulness that were reflected back from him;
and the household work was no longer performed with a languid indifference,
as if life and duty were distasteful. Miss Benson had her share in this
improvement, though Sally placidly took all the credit to herself. One
day as she and Ruth sat together, Miss Benson spoke of the child, and thence
went on to talk about her own childhood. By' degrees they spoke of education,
and the book-learning that forms one part of it; and the result was that
Ruth determined to get up early all through the bright summer mornings,
to acquire the knowledge hereafter to be given to her child. Her mind was
uncultivated, her reading scant; beyond the mere mechanical arts of education
she knew nothing; but she had a refined taste, and excellent sense and
judgment to separate the true from the false. With these qualities, she
set to work under Mr. Benson's directions. She read in the early morning
the books that he marked out; she trained herself with strict perseverance
to do all thoroughly; she did not attempt to acquire any foreign language,
although her ambition was to learn Latin, in order to teach it to her boy.
Those summer mornings were happy, for she was learning neither to look
backwards nor forwards, but to live faithfully and earnestly in the present.
She rose while the hedge-sparrow was yet singing his <I>reveil</I> to his
mate; she dressed and opened her window, shading the soft-blowing air and
the sunny eastern light from her baby. If she grew tired, she went and
looked at him, and all her thoughts were holy prayers for him. Then she
would gaze awhile out of the high upper window on to the moorlands, that
swelled in waves one behind the other, in the grey, cool morning light.
These were her occasional. relaxations, and after them she returned with
strength to her work.</DD>
