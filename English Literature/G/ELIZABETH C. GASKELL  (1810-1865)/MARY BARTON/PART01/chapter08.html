<DD>
One Sunday afternoon, about three weeks after that mournful night, Jem
Wilson' set out with the ostensible purpose of calling on John Barton.
He was dressed in his best, his Sunday suit of course; while his face glittered
with the scrubbing he had bestowed on it. His dark black hair had been
arranged and re-arranged before the household looking-glass, and in his
button-hole he stuck a narcissus (a sweet Nancy is its pretty Lancashire
name), hoping it would attract Mary's notice, so that he might have the
delight of giving it her.</DD>

<DD>
It was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that Mary saw him some
minutes before he came into her father's house. She was sitting at the
end of the dresser, with the little window-blind drawn on one side, in
order that she might see the passers-by, in the intervals of reading her
Bible, which lay open before her. So she watched all the greeting a friend
gave Jem; she saw the face of condolence, the sympathetic shake of the
hand, and had time to arrange her own face and manner before Jem came in,
which he did, as if he had eyes for no one but her father, who sat smoking
his pipe by the fire, while he read an old <I>Northern Star</I>, borrowed
from a neighbouring public-house.</DD>

<DD>
Then he turned to Mary, who, he felt by the sure instinct of love, by which
almost his body thought, was present. Her hands were busy adjusting her
dress forced and unnecessary movement Jem could not help thinking. Her
accost was quiet and friendly, if grave; she felt that she reddened like
a rose, and wished she could prevent it, while Jem wondered if her blushes
arose from fear, or anger, or love.</DD>

<DD>
She was very cunning, I am afraid. She pretended to read diligently, and
not to listen to a word that was said, while in fact she heard all sounds,
even to Jem's long, deep sighs, which wrung her heart. At last she took
up her Bible, and as if their conversation disturbed her, went up-stairs
to her little room. And she had scarcely spoken a word to Jem; scarcely
looked at him; never noticed his beautiful sweet Nancy, which only awaited
her least word of praise to be hers! He did not know--that pang was spared--that
in her little dingy bedroom stood a white jug, filled with a luxuriant
bunch of early spring roses, making the whole room fragrant and bright.
They were the gift of her richer lover. So Jem bad to go on sitting with
John Barton, fairly caught in his own trap, and bad to listen to his talk,
and answer him as best he might.</DD>

<DD>
"There's the right stuff in this here 'Star,' and no mistake. Such a right-down
piece for short hours."</DD>

<DD>
"At the same rate of wages as now?" asked Jem.</DD>

<DD>
"Aye, aye! else where's the use? It's only taking out o' the masters' pocket
what they can well afford. Did I ever tell ye what th' Infirmary chap let
me into, many a year agone?"</DD>

<DD>
"No," said Jem, listlessly.</DD>

<DD>
"Well! yo must know I were in th' Infirmary for a fever, and times were
rare and bad, and there be good chaps there to a man, while he's wick,
whate'er they may be about cutting him up at after. So when I were better
o' th' fever, but weak as water, they says to me, says they, 'If yo' can
write, you may stay in a week longer, and help our surgeon wi' sorting
his papers; and we'll take care yo've your bellyful of meat and drink.
Yo'll be twice as strong in a week.' So there wanted but one word to that
bargain. So I were set to writing and copying; th' writing I could do well
enough, but they'd such queer ways o' spelling, that I'd ne'er been used
to, that I'd to look first at th' copy and then at my letters, for all
the world like a cock picking up grains o' corn. But one thing startled
me e'en then, and I thought I'd make bold to ask the surgeon the meaning
o't. I've getten no head for numbers, but this I know, that by <I>far th'
greater part o' th' accidents as comed in, happened in th' last two hours
o' work</I>, when folk getten tired and careless. Th' surgeon said it were
all true, and that he were going to bring that fact to light."</DD>

<DD>
Jem was pondering Mary's conduct; but the pause made him aware he ought
to utter some civil listening noise; so he said,</DD>

<DD>
"Very true."</DD>

<DD>
"Aye, it's true enough, my lad, that we're sadly over-borne, and worse
will come of it afore long. Block-printers is going to strike; they'n getten
a bang-up union, as won't let 'em be put upon. But there's many a thing
will happen afore long, as folk don't expect. Yo may take my word for that,
Jem."</DD>

<DD>
Jem was very willing to take it, but did not express the curiosity he should
have done. So John Barton thought he'd try another hint or two.</DD>

<DD>
"Working folk won't be ground to the dust much longer. We'n a' had as much
to bear as human nature can bear. So, if th' masters can't do us no good,
and they say they can't, we mun try higher folk."</DD>

<DD>
Still Jem was not curious. He gave up hope of seeing Mary again by her
own good free will; and the next best thing would be, to be alone to think
of her. So muttering something which he meant to serve as an excuse for
his sudden departure, he hastily wished John good afternoon, and left him
to resume his pipe and his politics.</DD>

<DD>
For three years past trade had been getting worse and worse, and the price
of provisions higher and higher. This disparity between the amount of the
earnings of the working classes and the price of their food, occasioned,
in more cases than could well be imagined, disease and death. Whole families
went through a gradual starvation. They only wanted a Dante to record their
sufferings. And yet even his words would fall short of the awful truth;
they could only present an outline of the tremendous facts of the destitution
that surrounded thousands upon thousands in the terrible years 1839, 1840,
and 1841. Even philanthropists who had studied the subject, were forced
to own themselves perplexed in their endeavour to ascertain the real causes
of the misery; the whole matter was of so complicated a nature, that it
became next to impossible to understand it thoroughly. It need excite no
surprise, then, to learn that a bad feeling between working men and the
upper classes became very strong in this season of privation. The indigence
and sufferings of the operatives induced a suspicion in the minds of many
of them, that their legislators, their magistrates, their employers, and
even the ministers of religion, were, in general, their oppressors and
enemies; and were in league for their prostration and enthralment. The
most deplorable and enduring evil that arose out of the period of commercial
depression to which I refer, was this feeling of alienation between the
different classes of society. It is so impossible to describe, or even
faintly to picture, the state of distress which prevailed in the town at
that time, that I will not attempt it; and yet I think again that surely,
in a Christian land, it was not known even so feebly as words could tell
it, or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged with their sympathy
and their aid. In many instances the sufferers wept first, and then they
cursed. Their vindictive feelings exhibited themselves in rabid politics.
And when I hear, as I have heard, of the sufferings and privations of the
poor, of provision shops where ha'porths of tea, sugar, butter, and even
flour, were sold to accommodate the indigent,--of parents sitting in their
clothes by the fireside during the whole night for seven weeks together,
in order that their only bed and bedding might be reserved for the use
of their large family,--of others sleeping upon the cold hearthstone for
weeks in succession, without adequate means of providing themselves with
food or fuel (and this in the depth of winter),--of others being compelled
to fast for days together, uncheered by any hope of better fortune, living,
moreover, or rather starving, in a crowded garret, or damp cellar, and
gradually sinking under the pressure of want and despair into a premature
grave; and when this has been confirmed by the evidence of their careworn
looks, their excited feelings, and their desolate homes,--can I wonder
that many of them, in such times of misery and destitution, spoke and acted
with ferocious precipitation?</DD>

<DD>
An idea was now springing up among the operatives, that originated with
the Chartists, but which came at last to be cherished as a darling child
by many and many a one. They could not believe that government knew of
their misery they rather chose to think it possible that men could voluntarily
assume the office of legislators for a nation who were ignorant of its
real state; as who should make domestic rules for the pretty behaviour
of children without caring to know that those children had been kept for
days without food. Besides, the starving multitudes had heard, that the
very existence of their distress had been denied in Parliament; and though
they felt this strange and inexplicable, yet the idea that their misery
had still to be revealed in all its depths, and that then some remedy would
be found, soothed their aching hearts, and kept down their rising fury.</DD>

<DD>
So a petition was framed, and signed by thousands in the bright spring
days of 1839, imploring Parliament to hear witnesses who could testify
to the unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing districts. Nottingham,
Sheffield, Glasgow, Manchester, and many other towns, were busy appointing
delegates to convey this petition, who might speak, not merely of what
they had seen, and had heard, but from what they had borne and suffered.
Life-worn, gaunt, anxious, hunger-stamped men, were those delegates.</DD>

<DD>
One of them was John Barton. He would have been ashamed to own the flutter
of spirits his appointment gave him. There was the childish delight of
seeing London--that went a little way, and but a little way. There was
the vain idea of speaking out his notions before so many grand folk--that
went a little further; and last, there was the really pure gladness of
heart arising from the idea that he was one of those chosen to be instruments
in making known the distresses of the people, and consequently in procuring
them some grand relief, by means of which they should never suffer want
or care any more. He hoped largely, hut vaguely, of the results of his
expedition. An argosy of the precious hopes of many otherwise despairing
creatures, was that petition to be heard concerning their sufferings.</DD>

<DD>
The night before the morning on which the Manchester delegates were to
leave for London, Barton might be said to hold a levee, so many neighbours
came dropping in. Job Legh had early established himself and his pipe by
John Barton's fire, not saying much, but puffing away, and imagining himself
of use in adjusting the smoothing-irons that hung before the fire, ready
for Mary when she should want them. As for Mary, her employment was the
same as that of Beau Tibbs' wife, "just washing her father's two shirts,"
in the pantry back-kitchen; for she was anxious about his appearance in
London. (The coat had been redeemed, though the silk handkerchief was forfeited.)
The door stood open, as usual, between the house-place and back-kitchen,
so she gave her greeting to their friends as they entered.</DD>

<DD>
"So, John, yo're bound for London, are yo?" said one.</DD>

<DD>
"Aye, I suppose I mun go," answered John, yielding to necessity as it were.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, there's many a thing I'd like yo to speak on to the Parliament people.
Thou'lt not spare 'em, John; I hope. Tell 'em our minds; how we're thinking
we'n been clemmed long enough, and we donnot see whatten good they'n been
doing, if they can't give us what we're all crying for sin' the day we
were born."</DD>

<DD>
"Aye, aye! I'll tell 'em that, and much more to it, when it gets to my
turn; but thou knows there's many will have their word afore me."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, thou'lt speak at last. Bless thee, lad, do ask 'em to make th' masters
to break th' machines. There's never been good times sin' spinning-jennies
came up."</DD>

<DD>
"Machines is th' ruin of poor folk," chimed in several voices.</DD>

<DD>
"For my part," said a shivering, half-clad man, who crept near the fire,
as if ague-stricken, " I would like thee to tell 'em to pass th' short-hours'
bill. Flesh and blood gets wearied wi' so much work; why should factory
hands work so much longer nor other trades? Just ask 'em that, Barton,
will ye?"</DD>

<DD>
Barton was saved the necessity of answering, by the entrance of Mrs Davenport,
the poor widow he had been so kind to; she looked half-fed, and eager,
but was decently clad. In her hand she brought a little newspaper parcel,
which she took to Mary, who opened it, and then called out, dangling a
shirt collar from her soapy fingers:</DD>

<DD>
"See father, what a dandy you'll be in London! Mrs Davenport has brought
you this made new cut all after the fashion.--Thank you for thinking on
him."</DD>

<DD>
"Eh, Mary!" said Mrs Davenport, in a low voice, "whatten's all I can do,
to what he's done for me and mine? But, Mary, sure I can help ye, for you'll
be busy wi' this journey."</DD>

<DD>
"Just help me wring these out, and then I'll take em to th' mangle."</DD>

<DD>
So Mrs Davenport became a listener to the conversation; and after a while
joined in.</DD>

<DD>
"I'm sure, John Barton, if yo are taking messages to the Parliament folk,
yo'll not object to telling 'em what a sore trial it is, this law o' theirs,
keeping childer fra' factory work, whether they be weakly or strong. There's
our Ben; why, porridge seems to go no way wi' him, he eats so much; and
I han gotten no money to send him t' school, as I would like; and there
he is, rampaging about the streets a' day, getting hungrier and hungrier,
and picking up a' manner o' bad ways; and th' inspector won't let him in
to work in th' factory, because he's not right age; though he's twice as
strong as Sankey's little ritling of a lad, as works till he cries for
his legs aching so, though he is right age, and better."</DD>

<DD>
"I've one plan I wish to tell John Barton," said a pompous, careful-speaking
man, " and I should like him for to lay it afore the Honourable House.
My mother comed out o' Oxfordshire, and were under-laundry-maid in Sir
Francis Dashwood's family; and when we were little ones, she'd tell us
stories of their grandeur: and one thing she named were, that Sir Francis
wore two shirts a day. Now he were all as one as a Parliament man; and
many on 'em, I han no doubt, are like extravagant. Just tell 'em, John,do,
that they'd be doing the Lancashire weavers a great kindness, if they'd
ha' their shirts a' made o' calico; 'twould make trade brisk, that would,
wi' the power o' shirts they wear."</DD>

<DD>
Job Legh now put in his word. Taking the pipe out of his mouth, and addressing
the last speaker, he said:</DD>

<DD>
"I'll tell ye what, Bill, and no offence, mind ye; there's but hundreds
of them Parliament folk as wear so many shirts to their back; but there's
thousands and thousands o' poor weavers as han only gotten one shirt i'
the world; aye, and don't know where t' get another when that rag's done,
though they're turning out miles o' calico every day; and many a mile o't
is lying in warehouses, stopping up trade for want o' purchasers. Ye take
my advice, John Barton, and ask Parliament to set trade free, so as workmen
can earn a decent wage, and buy their two, aye and three, shirts a-year;
that would make weaving brisk."</DD>

<DD>
He put his pipe in his mouth again, and redoubled his puffing, to make
up for lost time.</DD>

<DD>
"I'm afeard, neighbours," said John Barton, "I've not much chance o' telling
'em all yo say; what I think on, is just speaking out about the distress
that they say is nought. When they hear o' children born on wet flags,
without a rag t' cover 'em or a bit o' food for th' mother; when they bear
of folk lying down to die i' th' streets, or hiding their want i' some
hole o' a cellar till death come to set 'em free; and when they hear o'
all this plague, pestilence, and famine, they'll surely do somewhat wiser
for us than we can guess at now. Howe'er, I han no objection, if so be
there's an opening, to speak up for what yo say; anyhow, I'll do my best,
and yo see now, if better times don't come after Parliament knows all."</DD>

<DD>
Some shook their heads, but more looked cheery: and then one by one dropped
off, leaving John and his daughter alone.</DD>

<DD>
"Didst thou mark bow poorly Jane Wilson looked?" asked he, as they wound
up their hard day's work by a supper eaten over the fire, which glowed
and glimmered through the room, and formed their only light.</DD>

<DD>
"No, I can't say as I did. But she's never rightly held up her head since
the twins died; and all along she has never been a strong woman.</DD>

<DD>
"Never sin' her accident. Afore that I mind her looking as fresh and likely
a girl as e'er a one in Manchester."</DD>

<DD>
"What accident, father?"</DD>

<DD>
"She cotched her side again a wheel. It were afore wheels were boxed up.
It were just when she were to have been married, and many a one thought
George would ha' been off his bargain; but I knew he wern't the chap for
that trick. Pretty near the first place she went to when she were able
to go about again, was th' Oud Church; poor wench, all pale and limping
she went up the aisle, George holding her up as tender as a mother, and
walking as slow as e'er he could, not to hurry her, though there were plenty
enow of rude lads to cast their jests at him and her. Her face were white
like a sheet when she came in church, but afore she got to th' altar she
were all one flush. But for a' that it's been a happy marriage, and George
has stuck by me through life like a brother. He'll never hold up his head
again if he loses Jane. I didn't like her looks tonight."</DD>

<DD>
And so he went to bed, the fear of forthcoming sorrow to his friend mingling
with his thoughts of to-morrow, and his hopes for the future. Mary watched
him set off, with her hands over her eyes to shade them from the bright
slanting rays of the morning sun, and then she turned into the house to
arrange its disorder before going to her work. She wondered if she should
like or dislike the evening and morning solitude; for several hours when
the clock struck she thought of her father, and wondered where he was;
she made good resolutions according to her lights; and by-and-by came the
distractions and events of the broad full day to occupy her with the present,
and to deaden the memory of the absent.</DD>

<DD>
One of Mary's resolutions was, that she would not be persuaded or induced
to see Mr Harry Carson during her father's absence. There was something
crooked in her conscience after all; for this very resolution seemed an
acknowledgment that it was wrong to meet him at any time; and yet she had
brought herself to think her conduct quite innocent and proper, for although
unknown to her father, and certain, even did he know it, to fail of obtaining
his sanction, she esteemed her love-meetings with Mr Carson as sure to
end in her father's good and happiness. But now that he was away, she would
do nothing that he would disapprove of; no, not even though it was for
his own good in the end.</DD>

<DD>
Now, amongst Miss Simmonds' young ladies was one who had been from the
beginning a confidante in Mary's love affair, made so by Mr Carson himself.
He had felt the necessity of some third person to carry letters and messages,
and to plead his cause when he was absent. In a girl named Sally Leadbitter
he had found a willing advocate. She would have been willing to have embarked
in a love-affair herself (especially a clandestine one), for the mere excitement
of the g; but her willingness was strengthened by sundry half-sovereigns,
which from time to time Mr Carson bestowed upon her.</DD>

<DD>
Sally Leadbitter was vulgar-minded to the last degree; never easy unless
her talk was of love and lovers; in her eyes it was an honour to have had
a long list of wooers. So constituted, it was a pity that Sally herself
was but a plain, red-haired, freckled girl; never likely, one would have
thought, to become a heroine on her own account. But what she lacked in
beauty she tried to make up for by a kind of witty boldness, which gave
her what her betters would have called piquancy. Considerations of modesty
or propriety never checked her utterance of a good thing. She had just
talent enough to corrupt others. Her very good-nature was an evil influence.
They could not hate one who was so kind; they could not avoid one who was
so willing to shield them from scrapes by any exertion of her own; whose
ready fingers would at any time make up for their deficiencies, and whose
still more convenient tongue would at any time invent for them. The Jews,
or Mohammedans (I forget which), believe that there is one little bone
of our body,--one of the vertebrae, if I remember rightly,--which will
never decay and turn to dust, but will lie incorrupt and indestructible
in the ground until the Last Day: this is the Seed of the Soul. The most
depraved have also their Seed of the Holiness that shall one day overcome
their evil. Their one good quality, lurking hidden, but safe, among all
the corrupt and had.</DD>

<DD>
Sally's seed of the future soul was her love for her mother, an aged bedridden
woman. For her she had self-denial; for her, her good-nature rose into
tenderness; to cheer her lonely bed, her spirits, in the evenings, when
her body was often wofully tired, never flagged, but were ready to recount
the events of the day, to turn them into ridicule, and to mimic, with admirable
fidelity, any person gifted with an absurdity who had fallen under her
keen eye. But the mother was lightly principled like Sally herself; nor
was there need to conceal from her the reason why Mr Carson gave her so
much money. She chuckled with pleasure, and only hoped that the wooing
would be long a-doing.</DD>

<DD>
Still neither she, nor her daughter, nor Harry Carson liked this resolution
of Mary, not to see him during her father's absence.</DD>

<DD>
One evening (and the early summer evenings were long and bright now), Sally
met Mr Carson by appointment, to be charged with a letter for Mary, imploring
her to see him, which Sally was to back with all her powers of persuasion.
After parting from him she determined, as it was not so very late, to go
at once to Mary's, and deliver the message and letter.</DD>

<DD>
She found Mary in great sorrow. She had just heard of George Wilson's sudden
death: her old friend, her father's friend, Jem's father--all his claims
came rushing upon her. Though not guarded from unnecessary sight or sound
of death, as the children of the rich are, yet it had so often been brought
home to her this last three or four months. It was so terrible thus to
see friend after friend depart. Her father, too, who had dreaded Jane Wilson's
death the evening before he set off. And she, the weakly, was left behind,
while the strong man was taken. At any rate the sorrow her father had so
feared for him was spared. Such were the thoughts which came over her.</DD>

<DD>
She could not go to comfort the bereaved, even if comfort were in her power
to give; for she had resolved to avoid Jem; and she felt that this of all
others was not the occasion on which she could keep up a studiously cold
manner.</DD>

<DD>
And in this shock of grief, Sally Leadbitter was the last person she wished
to see. However, she rose to welcome her, betraying her tear-swollen face.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I shall tell Mr Carson to-morrow how you're fretting for him; it's
no more nor he's doing for you, I can tell you."</DD>

<DD>
"For him, indeed!" said Mary, with a toss of her pretty head.</DD>

<DD>
"Aye, miss, for him! You've been sighing as if your heart would break now
for several days, over your work; now, arn't you a little goose not to
go and see one who I am sure loves you as his life, and whom you love;
'How much, Mary?' 'This much,' as the children say" (opening her arms very
wide).</DD>

<DD>
"Nonsense," said Mary pouting; "I often think I don't love him at all."</DD>

<DD>
"And I'm to tell him that, am I, next time I see him?" asked Sally.</DD>

<DD>
"If you like," replied Mary. "I'm sure I don't care for that or anything
else now;" weeping afresh.</DD>

<DD>
But Sally did not like to be the bearer of any such news. She saw she had
gone on the wrong tack, and that Mary's heart was too full to value either
message or letter as she ought. So she wisely paused in their delivery,
and said, in a more sympathetic tone than she had hitherto used.</DD>

<DD>
"Do tell me, Mary, what's fretting you so? You know I never could abide
to see you cry.</DD>

<DD>
"George Wilson's dropped down dead this afternoon," said Mary, fixing her
eyes for one minute on Sally, and the next hiding her face in her apron
as she sobbed anew.</DD>

<DD>
"Dear, dear! All flesh is grass; here to-day and gone to-morrow, as the
Bible says. Still he was an old man, and not good for much; there's better
folk (than him left behind. Is th' canting old maid as Was his sister alive
yet?"</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know who you mean," said Mary, sharply; for she did know, and
did not like to have her dear, simple Alice so spoken of.</DD>

<DD>
"Come, Mary, don't be so innocent. Is Miss Alice Wilson alive, then; will
that please you? I haven't seen her hereabouts lately."</DD>

<DD>
"No, she's left living here. When the twins died, she thought she could,
may be, be of use to her sister, who was sadly cast down, and Alice thought
she could cheer her up; at any rate she could listen to her when her heart
grew overburdened; so she gave up her cellar and went to live with them."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, good go with her. I'd no fancy for her, and I'd no fancy for her
making my pretty Mary into a Methodee."</DD>

<DD>
"She wasn't a Methodee she was Church o' England."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, well, Mary, you're very particular. You know what I meant. Look,
who is this letter from? holding up Henry Carson's letter.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know, and don't care," said Mary, turning very red.</DD>

<DD>
"My eye! as if I didn't know you did know and did care."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, give it me," said Mary, impatiently, and anxious in her present
mood for her visitor's departure.</DD>

Sally relinquished it unwillingly. She had, however, the pleasure of seeing
Mary dimple and blush as she read the letter, which seemed to say the writer
was not indifferent to her.</DD>

<DD>
"You must tell him I can't come," said Mary, raising her eyes at last.
"I have said I won't meet him while father is away, and I won't."</DD>

<DD>
"But, Mary, he does so look for you. You'd be quite sorry for him, he's
so put out about not seeing you. Besides, you go when your father's at
home, without letting on to him, and what harm would there be in going
now?"</DD>

<DD>
"Well, Sally, you know my answer, I won't; and I won't."</DD>

<DD>
"I'll tell him to come and see you himself some evening, instead o' sending
me; he'd may be find you not so hard to deal with."</DD>

<DD>
Mary flashed up.</DD>

<DD>
"If he dares to come here while father's away, I'll call the neighbours
in to turn him out, so don't be putting him up to that."</DD>

<DD>
"Mercy on us! one would think you were the first girl that ever had a lover;
have you never heard what other girls do and think no shame of?"</DD>

<DD>
"Hush, Sally! that's Margaret Jennings at the door."</DD>

<DD>
And in an instant Margaret was in the room. Mary had begged Job Legh to
let her come and sleep with her. In the uncertain fire-light you could
not help noticing that she had the groping walk of a blind person.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I must go, Mary," said Sally. "And that's your last word?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, yes; good night," She shut the door gladly on her unwelcome visitor--unwelcome
at that time at least.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Margaret, have ye heard this sad news about George Wilson?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, that I have. Poor creatures, they've been sore tried lately. Not
that I think sudden death so bad a thing; it's easy, and there's no terrors
for him as dies. For them as survives it's very hard. Poor George! he were
such a hearty-looking man."</DD>

<DD>
"Margaret," said Mary who had been closely observing her friend, "thou'rt
very blind to-night, arn't thou? Is it wi' crying? Your eyes are so swollen
and red."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, dear! but not crying for sorrow. Han ye beard where I was last night?"</DD>

<DD>
"No; where?"</DD>

<DD>
"Look here." She held up a bright golden sovereign. Mary opened her large
grey eyes with astonishment.</DD>

<DD>
"I'll tell you all how and about it. You see there's a gentleman lecturing
on music at th' Mechanics', and he wants folk to sing his songs. Well,
last night the counter got a sore throat and couldn't make a note. So they
sent for me. Jacob Butterworth had said a good word for me, and they asked
me would I sing? You may think I was frightened, but I thought now or never,
and said I'd do my best. So I tried o'er the songs wi' th' lecturer, and
then th' managers told me I were to make myself decent and be there by
seven."</DD>

<DD>
"And what did you put on?" asked Mary. "Oh, why didn't you come in for
my pretty pink gingham?"</DD>

<DD>
"I did think on't; but you had na come home then. No! I put on my merino,
as was turned last winter, and my white shawl, and did my hair pretty tidy;
it did well enough. Well, but as I was saying, I went at seven. I couldn't
see to read my music, but I took th' paper in wi' me, to ha' something
to do wi' my fingers. Th' folks' heads danced, as I stood as right afore
'em all as if I'd been going to play at ball wi' 'em. You may guess I felt
squeamish, but mine weren't the first song, and th' music sounded like
a friend's voice telling me to take courage. So, to make a long story short,
when it were all o'er th' lecturer thanked me, and th' managers said as
how there never was a new singer so applauded (for they'd clapped and stamped
after I'd done, till I began to wonder how many pair o' shoes they'd get
through a week at that rate, let alone their hands). So I'm to sing again
o' Thursday; and I got a sovereign last night, and am to have half-a-sovereign
every night th' lecturer is at th' Mechanics'."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, Margaret, I'm right glad to hear it."</DD>

<DD>
"And I don't think you've heard the best bit yet. Now that a way seemed
open to me, of not being a burden to any one, though it did please God
to make me blind, I thought I'd tell grandfather. I only tell'd him about
the singing and the sovereign last night, for I thought I'd not send him
to bed wi' a heavy heart; but this morning I telled him all."</DD>

<DD>
"And how did he take it?"</DD>

<DD>
"He's not a man of many words; and it took him by surprise like."</DD>

<DD>
"I wonder at that; I've noticed it in your ways ever since you telled me.</DD>

<DD>
"Aye, that's it I If I'd not telled you, and you'd seen me every day, you'd
not ha' noticed the little mite o' difference fra' day to day."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, but what did your grandfather say?"</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Mary," said Margaret, half smiling, "I'm a bit loath to tell yo,
for unless yo knew grandfather's ways like me, yo'd think it strange. He
was taken by surprise, and he said: 'Damn yo!' Then he began looking at
his book as it were, and were very quiet, while I telled him all about
it; how I'd feared, and how downcast I'd been; and how I were now reconciled
to it, if it were th' Lord's will; and how I hoped to earn money by singing;
and while I were talking, I saw great big tears come dropping on th' book;
but in course I never let on that I saw 'em. Dear grandfather I and all
day long he's been quietly moving things out o' my way, as he thought might
trip me up, and putting things in my way as he thought I might want; never
knowing I saw and felt what he were doing; for, yo see he thinks I'm out
and out blind, I guess--as I shall be soon."</DD>

<DD>
Margaret sighed in spite of her cheerful and relieved tone.</DD>

<DD>
Though Mary caught the sigh, she felt it was better to let it pass without
notice, and began, with the tact which true sympathy rarely fails to supply,
to ask a variety of questions respecting her friend's musical debut, which
tended to bring out more distinctly how successful it had been.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Margaret," at length she exclaimed, "thou'lt become as famous, may
be, as that grand lady fra' London, as we see'd one night driving up to
th' concert room door in her carriage."</DD>

<DD>
"It looks very like it," said Margaret, with a smile. "And be sure, Mary,
I'll not forget to give thee a lift now an' then when that comes about.
Nay, who knows, if thou'rt a good girl, but may happen I may make thee
my lady's maid I Wouldn't that be nice? So I e'en sing to mysel' th' beginning
o' one o' my songs,</DD>

<DD>
'An' ye shall walk in silk attire,</DD>

<DD>
An' siller hae to spare.'</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, don't stop; or else give me something rather more new, for somehow
I never quite liked that part about thinking o' Donald mair."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, though I'm a bit tir'd, I don't care if I do. Before I come, I were
practising well nigh upon two hours this one which I'm to sing o' Thursday.
Th' lecturer said he were sure it would just suit me, and I should do justice
to it; and I should be right sorry to disappoint him, he were so nice and
encouraging 1ike to me. Eh! Mary, what a pity there isn't more o' that
way, and less scolding and rating i' th' world! It would go a vast deal
further. Beside, some o' th' singers said, they were a'most certain that
it were a song o' his own, because he were so fidgety and particular about
it, and so anxious I should give it th' proper expression. And that makes
me care still more. Th' first verse, he said, were to be sung 'tenderly,
but joyously!' I'm afraid I don't quite hit that, but I'll try.</DD>

<DD>
What a single word can do!</DD>

<DD>
Thrilling all the heart-strings through,</DD>

<DD>
Calling forth fond memories,</DD>

<DD>
Raining round hope's melodies,</DD>

<DD>
Steeping all in one bright hue--</DD>

<DD>
What a single word can do!</DD>

<DD>
Now it falls into th' minor key, and must be very sad like. I feel as if
I could do that better than t'other.</DD>

<DD>
What a single word can do!</DD>

<DD>
Making life seem all untrue,</DD>

<DD>
Driving joy and hope away,</DD>

<DD>
Leaving not one cheering ray,</DD>

<DD>
Blighting every flower that grew--</DD>

<DD>
What a single word can do!</DD>

<DD>
Margaret certainly made the most of this little song. As a factory worker,
listening outside, observed, "She spun it reet fine!" And if she only sang
it at the Mechanics' with half the feeling she put into it that night,
the lecturer must have been hard to please, if he did not admit that his
expectations were more than fulfilled.</DD>

<DD>
When it was ended, Mary's looks told more than words could have done what
she thought of it; and partly to keep in a tear which would fain have rolled
out, she brightened into a laugh, and said, "For certain, th' carriage
is coming. So let us go and dream on it."</DD>
