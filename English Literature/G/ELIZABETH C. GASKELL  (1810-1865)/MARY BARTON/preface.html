Three years ago I became anxious (from circumstances that need not be more
fully alluded to) to employ myself in writing a work of fiction. Living
in Manchester, but with a deep relish and fond admiration for the country,
my first thought was to find a frame-work for my story in some rural scene;
and I had already made a little progress in a tale, the period of which
was more than a century ago, and the place on the borders of Yorkshire,
when I bethought me how deep might be the romance in the lives of some
of those who elbowed me daily in the busy streets of the town in which
I resided. I had always felt a deep sympathy with the care-worn men, who
looked as if doomed to struggle through their lives in strange alternations
between work and want; tossed to and fro by circumstances, apparently in
even a greater degree than other men. A little manifestation of this sympathy
and a little attention to the expression of feelings on the part of some
of the work-people with whom I was acquainted, had laid open to me the
hearts of one or two of the more thoughtful among them; I saw that they
were sore and irritable against the rich, the even tenor of whose seemingly
happy lives appeared to increase the anguish caused by the lottery-like
nature of their own. Whether the bitter complaints made by them, of the
neglect which they experienced from the prosperous--especially from the
masters whose fortunes they had helped to build up--were well-founded or
no, it is not for me to judge. It is enough to say, that this belief of
the injustice and unkindness which they endure from their fellow-creatures,
taints what might be resignation to God's will, and turns it to revenge
in too many of the poor uneducated factory-workers of Manchester.

<P>The more I reflected on this unhappy state of things between those so
bound to each other by common interests, as the employers and the employed
must ever be, the more anxious I became to give some utterance to the agony
which, from time to time, convulses this dumb people; the agony of suffering
without the sympathy of the happy, or of erroneously believing that such
is the case. If it be an error, that the woes, which come with ever-returning
tide-like flood to overwhelm the workmen in our manufacturing towns, pass
unregarded by all but the sufferers, it is at any rate an error so bitter
in its consequences to all parties, that whatever public effort can do
in the way of legislation, or private effort in the way of merciful deeds,
or helpless love in the way of widow's mites, should be done, and that
speedily, to disabuse the work-people of so miserable a misapprehension.
At present they seem to me to be left in a state, wherein lamentations
and tears are thrown aside as useless, but in which the lips are compressed
for curses, and the hands clenched and ready to smite.

<P>I know nothing of Political Economy, or the theories of trade. I have
tried to write truthfully; and if my accounts agree or clash with any system,
the agreement or disagreement is unintentional.

<P>To myself the idea which I have formed of the state of feeling among
too many of the factory-people in Manchester, and which I endeavoured to
represent in this tale (completed above a year ago), has received some
confirmation from the events which have so recently occurred among a similar
class on the Continent.
