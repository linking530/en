<DD>
I must now go back to an hour or two before Mary and her friends parted
for the night. It might be about eight o'clock that evening, and the three
Miss Carsons were sitting in their father's drawing-room. He was asleep
in the dining-room, in his own comfortable chair. Mrs Carson was (as was
usual with her, when no particular excitement was going on) very poorly,
and sitting up-stairs in her dressing-room, indulging in the luxury of
a headache. She was not well, certainly. "Wind in the head," the servants
called it. But it was but the natural consequence of the state of mental
and bodily idleness in which she was placed. Without education enough to
value the resources of wealth and leisure, she was so circumstanced as
to command both. It would have done her more good than all the ether and
sal-volatile she was daily in the habit of swallowing, if she might have
taken the work of one of her own housemaids for a week; made beds, rubbed
tables, shaken carpets, and gone out into the fresh morning air, without
all the paraphernalia of shawl, cloak, boa, fur boots, bonnet, and veil,
in which she was equipped before setting out for an "airing," in the closely
shut-up carriage.</DD>

<DD>
So the three girls were by themselves in the comfortable, elegant, well-lighted
drawing-room; and, like many similarly-situated young ladies, they did
not exactly know what to do to while away the time until the tea-hour.
The elder two had been at a dancing-party the night be fore, and were listless
and sleepy in consequence. One tried to read "Emerson's Essays," and fell
asleep in the attempt; the other was turning over a parcel of new songs,
in order to select what she liked. Amy, the youngest, was copying some
manuscript music. The air was heavy with the fragrance of strongly-scented
flowers, which sent out their night odours from an adjoining conservatory.</DD>

<DD>
The clock on the chimney-piece chimed eight. Sophy (the sleeping sister)
started up at the sound.</DD>

<DD>
"What o'clock is that?" she asked.</DD>

<DD>
"Eight," said Amy.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, dear! how tired I am! Is Harry come in? Tea will rouse one up a little.
Are you not worn out, Helen?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; I am tired enough. One is good for nothing the day after a dance.
Yet I don't feel weary at the time; I suppose it is the lateness of the
hours."</DD>

<DD>
"And yet, how could it be managed otherwise? So many don't dine till five
or six, that one cannot begin before eight or nine; and then it takes a
long time to get into the spirit of the evening. It is always more pleasant
after supper than before."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I'm too tired to-night to reform the world in the matter of dances
or balls. What are you copying, Amy?"</DD>

<DD>
"Only that little Spanish air you sing, 'Quien quiera.'"</DD>

<DD>
"What are you copying it for?" asked Helen.</DD>

<DD>
"Harry asked me to do it for him this morning at breakfast-time--for Miss
Richardson, he said."</DD>

<DD>
"For Jane Richardson!" said Sophy, as if a new idea were receiving strength
in her mind.</DD>

<DD>
"Do you think Harry means anything by his attention to her?" asked Helen.</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, I do not know anything more than you do; I can only observe and conjecture.
What do you think, Helen?"</DD>

<DD>
"Harry always likes to be of consequence to the belle of the room. If one
girl is more admired than another, he likes to flutter about her, and seem
to be on intimate terms with her. That is his way, and I have not noticed
anything beyond that in his manner to Jane Richardson."</DD>

<DD>
"But I don't think she knows it's only his way. Just watch her the next
time we meet her when Harry is there, and see how she crimsons, and looks
another way when she feels he is coming up to her. I think he sees it,
too, and I think he is pleased with it."</DD>

<DD>
"I dare say Harry would like well enough to turn the head of such a lovely
girl as Jane Richardson. But I'm not convinced that he's in love, whatever
she may be."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, then!" said Sophy, indignantly, "though it is our own brother, I
do think he is behaving very wrongly. The more I think of it, the more
sure I am that she thinks he means something, and that he intends her to
think so. And then, when he leaves off paying her attention----"</DD>

<DD>
"Which will be as soon as a prettier girl makes her appearance," interrupted
Helen.</DD>

<DD>
"As soon as he leaves off paying her attention," resumed Sophy, "she will
have many and many a heart-ache, and then she will harden herself into
being a flirt, a feminine flirt, as he is a masculine flirt. Poor girl"</DD>

<DD>
"I don't like to hear you speak so of Harry," said Amy, looking up at Sophy.</DD>

<DD>
"And I don't like to have to speak so, Amy, for I love him dearly. He is
a good, kind brother, but I do think him vain, and I think he hardly knows
the misery, the crime, to which indulged vanity may lead him."</DD>

<DD>
Helen yawned.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! do you think we may ring for tea. Sleeping after dinner makes me so
feverish."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, surely. Why should not we?" said the more energetic Sophy, pulling
the bell with some determination.</DD>

<DD>
"Tea, directly, Parker," said she, authoritatively, as the man entered
the room.</DD>

<DD>
She was too little in the habit of reading expressions on the faces of
others to notice Parker's countenance.</DD>

<DD>
Yet it was striking. It was blanched to a dead whiteness; the lips compressed
as if to keep within some tale of horror; the eyes distended and unnatural.
It was a terror-stricken face.</DD>

<DD>
The girls began to put away their music and books, in preparation for tea.
The door slowly opened again, and this time it was the nurse who entered.
I call her nurse, for such had been her office in bygone days, though now
she held rather an anomalous situation in the family. Seamstress, attendant
on the young ladies, keeper of the stores; only "Nurse" was still her name.
She had lived longer with them than any other servant, and to her their
manner was far less haughty than to the other domestics. She occasionally
came into the drawing-room to look for things belonging to their father
or mother, so it did not excite any surprise when she advanced into the
room. They went on arranging their various articles of employment.</DD>

<DD>
She wanted them to look up. She wanted them to read something in her face--
her face so full of woe, of horror. But they went on without taking any
notice. She coughed; not a natural cough; but one of those coughs which
asks so plainly for remark.</DD>

<DD>
"Dear nurse, what is the matter?" asked Amy. "Are not you well?"</DD>

<DD>
"Is mamma ill?" asked Sophy quickly.</DD>

<DD>
"Speak, speak, nurse!" said they all, as they saw her efforts to articulate
choked by the convulsive rising in her throat. They clustered round her
with eager faces, catching a glimpse of some terrible truth to be revealed.</DD>

<DD>
"My dear young ladies! my dear girls!" she gasped out at length, and then
she burst into tears.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! do tell us what it is, nurse!" said one. "Any-thing is better than
this. Speak!"</DD>

<DD>
"My children! I don't know bow to break it to you. My dears, poor Mr Harry
is brought home----"</DD>

<DD>
"Brought home--<I>brought</I> home--how?" Instinctively they sank their
voices to a whisper; but a fearful whisper it was. In the same low tone,
as if afraid lest the walls, the furniture, the inanimate things which
told of preparation for life and comfort, should hear, she answered,</DD>

<DD>
"Dead!"</DD>

<DD>
Amy clutched her nurse's arm, and fixed her eyes on her as if to know if
such a tale could be true; and when she read its confirmation in those
sad, mournful, unflinching eyes, she sank, without word or sound, down
in a faint upon the floor. One sister sat down on an ottoman, and covered
her face, to try and realize it. That was Sophy. Helen threw herself on
the sofa, and burying her head in the pillows, tried to stifle the screams
and moans which shook her frame.</DD>

<DD>
The nurse stood silent. She had not told all.</DD>

<DD>
"Tell me," said Sophy, looking up, and speaking in a hoarse voice, which
told of the inward pain, "tell me, nurse! Is he <I>dead</I>, did you say?
Have you sent for a doctor? Oh! send for one, send for one," continued
she, her voice rising to shrillness, and starting to her feet. Helen lifted
herself up, and looked, with breathless waiting, towards nurse.</DD>

<DD>
"My dears, he is dead! But I have sent for a doctor. I have done all I
could."</DD>

<DD>
"When did he--when did they bring him home?" asked Sophy.</DD>

<DD>
"Perhaps ten minutes ago. Before you rang for Parker."</DD>

<DD>
"How did he die? Where did they find him? He looked so well. He always
seemed so strong. Oh! are you sure he is dead?"</DD>

<DD>
She went towards the door. Nurse laid her hand on her arm.</DD>

<DD>
"Miss Sophy, I have not told you all. Can you bear to hear it? Remember,
master is in the next room, and he knows nothing yet. Come, you must help
me to tell him. Now, be quiet, dear! It was no common death he died!" She
looked in her face as if trying to convey her meaning by her eyes.</DD>

<DD>
Sophy's lips moved, but nurse could hear no sound.</DD>

<DD>
"He has been shot as he was coming home along Turner Street to-night."</DD>

<DD>
Sophy went on with the motion of her lips, twitching them almost convulsively.</DD>

<DD>
"My dear, you must rouse yourself, and remember your father and mother
have yet to be told. Speak Miss Sophy!"</DD>

<DD>
But she could not; her whole face worked involuntarily. The nurse left
the room, and almost immediately brought back some sal-volatile and water.
Sophy drank it eagerly, and gave one or two deep gasps. Then she spoke
in a calm, unnatural voice.</DD>

<DD>
"What do you want me to do, nurse? Go to Helen, and poor Amy. See, they
want help."</DD>

<DD>
"Poor creatures! we must let them alone for a bit. You must go to master;
that's what I want you to do, Miss Sophy. You must break it to him, poor
old gentleman! Come, he's asleep in the dining-room, and the men are waiting
to speak to him."</DD>

<DD>
Sophy went mechanically to the dining-room door.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I cannot go in. I cannot tell him. What must I say?"</DD>

<DD>
"I'll come with you, Miss Sophy. Break it to him by degrees."</DD>

<DD>
"I can't, nurse. My head throbs so, I shall be sure to say the wrong thing."</DD>

<DD>
However, she opened the door. There sat the father, the shaded light of
the candle-lamp falling upon, and softening his marked features, while
his snowy hair contrasted well with the deep crimson morocco of the chair.
The newspaper he had been reading had dropped on the carpet by his side.
He breathed regularly and deeply.</DD>

<DD>
At that instant the words of Mrs Hemans's song came full in Sophy's mind:--</DD>

<DD>
Ye know not what ye do,</DD>

<DD>
That call the slumberer back</DD>

<DD>
From the realms unseen by you,</DD>

<DD>
To life's dim weary track.</DD>

<DD>
But this life's track would be to the bereaved father something more than
dim and weary, hereafter.</DD>

<DD>
"Papa," said she, softly. He did not stir.</DD>

<DD>
"Papa!" she exclaimed somewhat louder.</DD>

<DD>
He started up, half awake.</DD>

<DD>
"Tea is ready, is it?" and he yawned.</DD>

<DD>
"No! papa, but something very dreadful--very sad, has happened!"</DD>

<DD>
He was gaping so loud that he did not catch the words she uttered, and
did not see the expression of her face.</DD>

<DD>
"Master Henry is not come back," said nurse. Her voice, heard in unusual
speech to him, arrested his attention, and rubbing his eyes, he looked
at the servant.</DD>

<DD>
"Harry! oh no! he had to attend a meeting of the masters about these cursed
turn-outs. I don't expect him yet. What are you looking at me so strangely
for, Sophy?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, papa, Harry is come back," said she, bursting into tears..</DD>

<DD>
"What do you mean?" said he, startled into an impatient consciousness that
something was wrong. "One of you says he is not come home, and the other
says he is. Now, that's nonsense! Tell me at once what's the matter. Did
he go on horseback to town? Is he thrown? Speak, child, can't you?"</DD>

<DD>
"No! he's not been thrown, papa, said Sophy, sadly.</DD>

<DD>
"But he's badly hurt," put in the nurse, desirous to be drawing his anxiety
to a point.</DD>

<DD>
"Hurt? Where? How? Have you sent for a doctor?" said he, hastily rising,
as if to leave the room.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, papa, we've sent for a doctor--but I'm afraid--I believe it's of
no use."</DD>

<DD>
He looked at her for a moment, and in her face he read the truth. His son,
his only son, was dead.</DD>

<DD>
He sank back in his chair, and hid his face in his hands, and bowed his
head upon the table. The strong mahogany dining-table shook and rattled
under his agony.</DD>

<DD>
Sophy went and put her arms round his bowed neck.</DD>

<DD>
"Go! you are not Harry," said he; but the action roused him.</DD>

<DD>
"Where is he? where is the----" said he, with his strong face set into
the lines of anguish, by two minutes of such intense woe.</DD>

<DD>
"In the servants' hall," replied nurse. "Two policemen and another man
brought him home. They would be glad to speak to you when you are able,
sir.'</DD>

<DD>
"I am now able," replied he. At first when he stood up he tottered. But
steadying himself; he walked, as firmly as a soldier on drill, to the door.
Then he turned back and poured out a glass of wine from the decanter which
yet remained on the table. His eye caught the wine-glass which Harry had
used but two or three hours before. He sighed a long quivering sigh, and
then mastering himself again, he left the room.</DD>

<DD>
"You had better go back to your sisters, Miss Sophy" said nurse.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Carson went. She could not face death yet.</DD>

<DD>
The nurse followed Mr Carson to the servants' hall. There on their dinner-table
lay the poor dead body. The men who had brought it were sitting near the
fire, while several of the servants stood round the table, gazing at the
remains.</DD>

<DD>
<I>The remains!</I></DD>

<DD>
One or two were crying; one or two were whispering; awed into a strange
stillness of voice and action by the presence of the dead. When Mr Carson
came in they all drew back and looked at him with the reverence due to
sorrow.</DD>

<DD>
He went forward and gazed long and fondly on the calm, dead face; then
he bent down and kissed the lips yet crimson with life. The policemen had
advanced, and stood ready to be questioned. But at first the old man's
mind could only take in the idea of death; slowly, slowly, came the conception
of violence, of murder, "How did he die?" he groaned forth.</DD>

<DD>
The policemen looked at each other. Then one began, and stated that having
heard the report of a gun in Turner Street, he had turned down that way
(a lonely unfrequented way Mr Carson knew, but a short cut to his garden
door, of which Harry had a key); that as he (the policeman) came nearer,
he had heard footsteps as of a man running away; but the evening was so
dark (the moon not having yet risen) that he could see no one twenty yards
off. That he had even been startled when close to the body by seeing it
lying across the path at his feet. That he had sprung his rattle; and when
another policeman came up, by the light of the lantern they had discovered
who it was that had been killed. That they believed him to be dead when
they first took him up, as he had never moved, spoken, or breathed. That
intelligence of the murder had been sent to the superintendent, who would
probably soon be here. That two or three policemen were still about the
p]ace, where the murder was committed, seeking out for some trace of the
murderer. Having said this, they stopped speaking.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Carson had listened attentively, never taking his eyes off the dead
body. When they had ended, he said,</DD>

<DD>
"Where was he shot?"</DD>

<DD>
They lifted up some of the thick chestnut curls, and showed a blue spot
(you could hardly call it a hole, the flesh had closed so much over it)
in the left temple. A deadly aim! And yet it was so dark a night!</DD>

<DD>
"He must have been close upon him," said one policeman.</DD>

<DD>
"And have had him between him and the sky," added the other.</DD>

<DD>
There was a little commotion at the door of th room, and there stood poor
Mrs Carson, the mother.</DD>

<DD>
She had heard unusual noises in the house, and had sent down her maid (much
more a companion to her than her highly-educated daughters) to discover
what was going on. But the maid either forgot, or dreaded, to return; and
with nervous impatience Mrs Carson came down herself; and had traced the
hum and buzz of voices to the servants' hall.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Carson turned round. But he could not leave the dead for any one living.</DD>

<DD>
"Take her away, nurse. It is no sight for her. Tell Miss Sophy to go to
her mother." His eyes were again fixed on the dead face of his son.</DD>

<DD>
Presently Mrs Carson's hysterical cries were heard all over the house.
Her husband shuddered at the outward expression of the agony which was
rending his heart.</DD>

<DD>
Then the police superintendent came, and after him the doctor. The latter
went through all the forms of ascertaining death, without uttering a word,
and when at the conclusion of the operation of opening a vein, from which
no blood flowed, he shook his head, all present understood the confirmation
of their previous belief. The superintendent asked to speak to Mr Carson
in private.</DD>

<DD>
"It was just what I was going to request of you," answered he; so he led
the way into the dining-room, with the wine-glass still on the table.</DD>

<DD>
The door was carefully shut, and both sat down, each apparently waiting
for the other to begin.</DD>

<DD>
At last Mr Carson spoke.</DD>

<DD>
"You probably have heard that I am a rich man."</DD>

<DD>
The superintendent bowed in assent.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, sir, half--nay, if necessary, the whole of my fortune I will give
to have the murderer brought to the gallows.</DD>

<DD>
"Every exertion, you may be sure, sir, shall be used on our part; but probably
offering a handsome reward might accelerate the discovery of the murderer.
But what I wanted particularly to tell you, sir, is that one of my men
has already got some clue, and that another (who accompanied me here) has
within this quarter of an hour found a gun in the field which the murderer
crossed, and which he probably threw away when pursued, as encumbering
his flight. I have not the smallest doubt of discovering the murderer."</DD>

<DD>
"What do you call a handsome reward?" said Mr Carson.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, sir, three, or five hundred pounds is a munificent reward more than
will probably be required as a temptation to any accomplice."</DD>

<DD>
"Make it a thousand" said Mr Carson, decisively. "It's the doing of those
damned turn-outs."</DD>

<DD>
"I imagine not," said the superintendent. "Some days ago the man I was
naming to you before, reported to the inspector when he came on his beat,
that he had to separate your son from a young man, who by his dress he
believed to be employed in a foundry; that the man had thrown Mr Carson
down, and seemed inclined to proceed to more violence, when the policeman
came up and interfered. Indeed, my man wished to give him in charge for
an assault, but Mr Carson would not allow that to be done."</DD>

<DD>
"Just like him!--noble fellow!" murmured the father.</DD>

<DD>
"But after your son had left, the man made use of some pretty strong threats.
And it's rather a curious coincidence that this scuffle took place in the
very same spot where the murder was committed; in Turner Street."</DD>

<DD>
There was some one knocking at the door of the room. It was Sophy, who
beckoned her father out, and then asked him, in an awe-struck whisper,
to come up-stairs and speak to her mother.</DD>

<DD>
"She will not leave Harry, and talks so strangely. Indeed--indeed--papa,
I think she has lost her senses."</DD>

<DD>
And the poor girl sobbed bitterly.</DD>

<DD>
"Where is she?" asked Mr Carson.</DD>

<DD>
"In his room."</DD>

<DD>
They went up-stairs rapidly, and silently. It was a large comfortable bedroom;
too large to be well lighted by the flaring, flickering kitchen-candle
which had been hastily snatched up, and now stood on the dressing-table.</DD>

<DD>
On the bed, surrounded by its heavy, pall-like green curtains, lay the
dead son. They had carried him up, and laid him down, as tenderly as though
they feared to waken him; and, indeed, it looked more like sleep than death,
so very calm and full of repose was the face. You saw, too, the chiselled
beauty of the features much more perfectly than when the brilliant colouring
of life had distracted your attention. There was a peace about him which
told that death had come too instantaneously to give any previous pain.</DD>

<DD>
In a chair, at the head of the bed, sat the mother,--smiling. She held
one of the hands (rapidly stiffening, even in her warm grasp), and gently
stroked the back of it, with the endearing caress she had used to all her
children when young.</DD>

<DD>
"I am glad you are come," said she, looking up at her husband, and still
smiling. "Harry is so full of fun, he always has something new to amuse
us with; and now he pretends he is asleep, and that we can't waken him.
Look he is smiling now; he hears I have found him out. Look!"</DD>

<DD>
And, in truth, the lips, in the rest of death, did look as though they
wore a smile, and the waving light of the unsnuffed candle almost made
them seem to move.</DD>

<DD>
"Look, Amy," said she to her youngest child, who knelt at her feet, trying
to soothe her, by kissing her garments.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, he was always a rogue! You remember, don't you, love? how full of
play he was as a baby; hiding his face under my arm, when you wanted to
play with him. Always a rogue, Harry!"</DD>

<DD>
"We must get her away, sir," said nurse; "you know there is much to be
done, before----"</DD>

<DD>
"I understand, nurse," said the father, hastily interrupting her in dread
of the distinct words which would tell of the changes of mortality.</DD>

<DD>
"Come, love," said he to his wife. "I want you to come with me. I want
to speak to you down-stairs."</DD>

<DD>
"I'm coming," said she, rising; "perhaps, after all, nurse, he's really
tired, and would be glad to sleep. Don't let him get cold, though,--he
feels rather chilly," continued she, after she had bent down, and kissed
the pale lips.</DD>

<DD>
Her husband put his arm around her waist, and they left the room. Then
the three sisters burst into unrestrained wailings. They were startled
into the reality of life and death. And yet in the midst of shrieks and
moans, of shivering and chattering of teeth, Sophy's eye caught the calm
beauty of the dead; so calm amidst such violence, and she hushed her emotion.</DD>

<DD>
"Come," said she to her sisters, nurse wants us to go; and besides, we
ought to be with mamma. Papa told the man he was talking to, when I went
for him, to wait, and she must not be left."</DD>

<DD>
Meanwhile, the superintendent had taken a candle, and was examining the
engravings that hung round the dining-room. It was so common to him to
be acquainted with crime, that he was far from feeling all his interest
absorbed in the present case of violence, although he could not help having
much anxiety to detect the murderer. He was busy looking at the only oil-painting
in the room (a youth of eighteen or so, in a fancy dress), and conjecturing
its identity with the young man so mysteriously dead, when the door opened,
and Mr Carson returned. Stern as he had looked before leaving the room,
he looked far sterner now. His face was hardened into deep-purposed wrath.</DD>

<DD>
"I beg your pardon, sir' or leaving you. The superintendent bowed. They
sat down, and spoke long together. One by one the policemen were called
in, and questioned.</DD>

<DD>
All through the night there was bustle and commotion in the house. Nobody
thought of going to bed. It seemed strange to Sophy to hear nurse summoned
from her mother's side to supper, in the middle of the night, and still
stranger that she should go. The necessity of eating and drinking seemed
out of place in the house of death.</DD>

<DD>
When night was passing into morning, the dining-room door opened, and two
persons' steps were beard along the hall.The superintendent was leaving
at last.Mr Carson stood on the front-door step, feeling the refreshment
of the caller morning air, and seeing the starlight fade away into dawn.</DD>

<DD>
"You will not forget," said he. "I trust to you." The policeman bowed.</DD>

<DD>
"Spare no money. The only purpose for which I now value wealth is to have
the murderer arrested, and brought to justice. My hope in life now is to
see him sentenced to death. Offer any rewards. Name a thousand pounds in
the placards. Come to me at any hour, night or day, if that be required.

heart of vengeance on the murderer. True, his vengeance was sanctioned
by law, but was it the less revenge?</DD>

Oh! Orestes, you would have made a very tolerable Christian of the nineteenth
