I HAVE observed few obvious subjects to have been so seldom, or at 

least so slightly, handled as this; and, indeed, I know few so 

difficult to be treated as it ought, nor yet upon which there 

seemeth so much to be said.



Most things pursued by men for the happiness of public or private 

life our wit or folly have so refined, that they seldom subsist but 

in idea; a true friend, a good marriage, a perfect form of 

government, with some others, require so many ingredients, so good 

in their several kinds, and so much niceness in mixing them, that 

for some thousands of years men have despaired of reducing their 

schemes to perfection.  But in conversation it is or might be 

otherwise; for here we are only to avoid a multitude of errors, 

which, although a matter of some difficulty, may be in every man's 

power, for want of which it remaineth as mere an idea as the other.  

Therefore it seemeth to me that the truest way to understand 

conversation is to know the faults and errors to which it is 

subject, and from thence every man to form maxims to himself 

whereby it may be regulated, because it requireth few talents to 

which most men are not born, or at least may not acquire without 

any great genius or study.  For nature bath left every man a 

capacity of being agreeable, though not of shining in company; and 

there are a hundred men sufficiently qualified for both, who, by a 

very few faults that they might correct in half an hour, are not so 

much as tolerable.



I was prompted to write my thoughts upon this subject by mere 

indignation, to reflect that so useful and innocent a pleasure, so 

fitted for every period and condition of life, and so much in all 

men's power, should be so much neglected and abused.



And in this discourse it will be necessary to note those errors 

that are obvious, as well as others which are seldomer observed, 

since there are few so obvious or acknowledged into which most men, 

some time or other, are not apt to run.



For instance, nothing is more generally exploded than the folly of 

talking too much; yet I rarely remember to have seen five people 

together where some one among them hath not been predominant in 

that kind, to the great constraint and disgust of all the rest.  

But among such as deal in multitudes of words, none are comparable 

to the sober deliberate talker, who proceedeth with much thought 

and caution, maketh his preface, brancheth out into several 

digressions, findeth a hint that putteth him in mind of another 

story, which he promiseth to tell you when this is done; cometh 

back regularly to his subject, cannot readily call to mind some 

person's name, holdeth his head, complaineth of his memory; the 

whole company all this while in suspense; at length, says he, it is 

no matter, and so goes on.  And, to crown the business, it perhaps 

proveth at last a story the company hath heard fifty times before; 

or, at best, some insipid adventure of the relater.



Another general fault in conversation is that of those who affect 

to talk of themselves.  Some, without any ceremony, will run over 

the history of their lives; will relate the annals of their 

diseases, with the several symptoms and circumstances of them; will 

enumerate the hardships and injustice they have suffered in court, 

in parliament, in love, or in law.  Others are more dexterous, and 

with great art will lie on the watch to hook in their own praise.  

They will call a witness to remember they always foretold what 

would happen in such a case, but none would believe them; they 

advised such a man from the beginning, and told him the 

consequences just as they happened, but he would have his own way.  

Others make a vanity of telling their faults.  They are the 

strangest men in the world; they cannot dissemble; they own it is a 

folly; they have lost abundance of advantages by it; but, if you 

would give them the world, they cannot help it; there is something 

in their nature that abhors insincerity and constraint; with many 

other unsufferable topics of the same altitude.



Of such mighty importance every man is to himself, and ready to 

think he is so to others, without once making this easy and obvious 

reflection, that his affairs can have no more weight with other men 

than theirs have with him; and how little that is he is sensible 

enough.



Where company hath met, I often have observed two persons discover 

by some accident that they were bred together at the same school or 

university, after which the rest are condemned to silence, and to 

listen while these two are refreshing each other's memory with the 

arch tricks and passages of themselves and their comrades.



I know a great officer of the army, who will sit for some time with 

a supercilious and impatient silence, full of anger and contempt 

for those who are talking; at length of a sudden demand audience; 

decide the matter in a short dogmatical way; then withdraw within 

himself again, and vouchsafe to talk no more, until his spirits 

circulate again to the same point.



There are some faults in conversation which none are so subject to 

as the men of wit, nor ever so much as when they are with each 

other.  If they have opened their mouths without endeavouring to 

say a witty thing, they think it is so many words lost.  It is a 

torment to the hearers, as much as to themselves, to see them upon 

the rack for invention, and in perpetual constraint, with so little 

success.  They must do something extraordinary, in order to acquit 

themselves, and answer their character, else the standers by may be 

disappointed and be apt to think them only like the rest of 

mortals.  I have known two men of wit industriously brought 

together, in order to entertain the company, where they have made a 

very ridiculous figure, and provided all the mirth at their own 

expense.



I know a man of wit, who is never easy but where he can be allowed 

to dictate and preside; he neither expecteth to be informed or 

entertained, but to display his own talents.  His business is to be 

good company, and not good conversation, and therefore he chooseth 

to frequent those who are content to listen, and profess themselves 

his admirers.  And, indeed, the worst conversation I ever remember 

to have heard in my life was that at Will's coffee-house, where the 

wits, as they were called, used formerly to assemble; that is to 

say, five or six men who had written plays, or at least prologues, 

or had share in a miscellany, came thither, and entertained one 

another with their trifling composures in so important an air, as 

if they had been the noblest efforts of human nature, or that the 

fate of kingdoms depended on them; and they were usually attended 

with a humble audience of young students from the inns of courts, 

or the universities, who, at due distance, listened to these 

oracles, and returned home with great contempt for their law and 

philosophy, their heads filled with trash under the name of 

politeness, criticism, and belles lettres.



By these means the poets, for many years past, were all overrun 

with pedantry.  For, as I take it, the word is not properly used; 

because pedantry is the too front or unseasonable obtruding our own 

knowledge in common discourse, and placing too great a value upon 

it; by which definition men of the court or the army may be as 

guilty of pedantry as a philosopher or a divine; and it is the same 

vice in women when they are over copious upon the subject of their 

petticoats, or their fans, or their china.  For which reason, 

although it be a piece of prudence, as well as good manners, to put 

men upon talking on subjects they are best versed in, yet that is a 

liberty a wise man could hardly take; because, beside the 

imputation of pedantry, it is what he would never improve by.



This great town is usually provided with some player, mimic, or 

buffoon, who hath a general reception at the good tables; familiar 

and domestic with persons of the first quality, and usually sent 

for at every meeting to divert the company, against which I have no 

objection.  You go there as to a farce or a puppet-show; your 

business is only to laugh in season, either out of inclination or 

civility, while this merry companion is acting his part.  It is a 

business he hath undertaken, and we are to suppose he is paid for 

his day's work.  I only quarrel when in select and private 

meetings, where men of wit and learning are invited to pass an 

evening, this jester should be admitted to run over his circle of 

tricks, and make the whole company unfit for any other 

conversation, besides the indignity of confounding men's talents at 

so shameful a rate.



Raillery is the finest part of conversation; but, as it is our 

usual custom to counterfeit and adulterate whatever is too dear for 

us, so we have done with this, and turned it all into what is 

generally called repartee, or being smart; just as when an 

expensive fashion cometh up, those who are not able to reach it 

content themselves with some paltry imitation.  It now passeth for 

raillery to run a man down in discourse, to put him out of 

countenance, and make him ridiculous, sometimes to expose the 

defects of his person or understanding; on all which occasions he 

is obliged not to be angry, to avoid the imputation of not being 

able to take a jest.  It is admirable to observe one who is 

dexterous at this art, singling out a weak adversary, getting the 

laugh on his side, and then carrying all before him.  The French, 

from whom we borrow the word, have a quite different idea of the 

thing, and so had we in the politer age of our fathers.  Raillery 

was, to say something that at first appeared a reproach or 

reflection, but, by some turn of wit unexpected and surprising, 

ended always in a compliment, and to the advantage of the person it 

was addressed to.  And surely one of the best rules in conversation 

is, never to say a thing which any of the company can reasonably 

wish we had rather left unsaid; nor can there anything be well more 

contrary to the ends for which people meet together, than to part 

unsatisfied with each other or themselves.



There are two faults in conversation which appear very different, 

yet arise from the same root, and are equally blamable; I mean, an 

impatience to interrupt others, and the uneasiness of being 

interrupted ourselves.  The two chief ends of conversation are, to 

entertain and improve those we are among, or to receive those 

benefits ourselves; which whoever will consider, cannot easily run 

into either of those two errors; because, when any man speaketh in 

company, it is to be supposed he doth it for his hearers' sake, and 

not his own; so that common discretion will teach us not to force 

their attention, if they are not willing to lend it; nor, on the 

other side, to interrupt him who is in possession, because that is 

in the grossest manner to give the preference to our own good 

sense.



There are some people whose good manners will not suffer them to 

interrupt you; but, what is almost as bad, will discover abundance 

of impatience, and lie upon the watch until you have done, because 

they have started something in their own thoughts which they long 

to be delivered of.  Meantime, they are so far from regarding what 

passes, that their imaginations are wholly turned upon what they 

have in reserve, for fear it should slip out of their memory; and 

thus they confine their invention, which might otherwise range over 

a hundred things full as good, and that might be much more 

naturally introduced.



There is a sort of rude familiarity, which some people, by 

practising among their intimates, have introduced into their 

general conversation, and would have it pass for innocent freedom 

or humour, which is a dangerous experiment in our northern climate, 

where all the little decorum and politeness we have are purely 

forced by art, and are so ready to lapse into barbarity.  This, 

among the Romans, was the raillery of slaves, of which we have many 

instances in Plautus.  It seemeth to have been introduced among us 

by Cromwell, who, by preferring the scum of the people, made it a 

court-entertainment, of which I have heard many particulars; and, 

considering all things were turned upside down, it was reasonable 

and judicious; although it was a piece of policy found out to 

ridicule a point of honour in the other extreme, when the smallest 

word misplaced among gentlemen ended in a duel.



There are some men excellent at telling a story, and provided with 

a plentiful stock of them, which they can draw out upon occasion in 

all companies; and considering how low conversation runs now among 

us, it is not altogether a contemptible talent; however, it is 

subject to two unavoidable defects:  frequent repetition, and being 

soon exhausted; so that whoever valueth this gift in himself hath 

need of a good memory, and ought frequently to shift his company, 

that he may not discover the weakness of his fund; for those who 

are thus endowed have seldom any other revenue, but live upon the 

main stock.



Great speakers in public are seldom agreeable in private 

conversation, whether their faculty be natural, or acquired by 

practice and often venturing.  Natural elocution, although it may 

seem a paradox, usually springeth from a barrenness of invention 

and of words, by which men who have only one stock of notions upon 

every subject, and one set of phrases to express them in, they swim 

upon the superficies, and offer themselves on every occasion; 

therefore, men of much learning, and who know the compass of a 

language, are generally the worst talkers on a sudden, until much 

practice hath inured and emboldened them; because they are 

confounded with plenty of matter, variety of notions, and of words, 

which they cannot readily choose, but are perplexed and entangled 

by too great a choice, which is no disadvantage in private 

conversation; where, on the other side, the talent of haranguing 

is, of all others, most insupportable.



Nothing hath spoiled men more for conversation than the character 

of being wits; to support which, they never fail of encouraging a 

number of followers and admirers, who list themselves in their 

service, wherein they find their accounts on both sides by pleasing 

their mutual vanity.  This hath given the former such an air of 

superiority, and made the latter so pragmatical, that neither of 

them are well to be endured.  I say nothing here of the itch of 

dispute and contradiction, telling of lies, or of those who are 

troubled with the disease called the wandering of the thoughts, 

that they are never present in mind at what passeth in discourse; 

for whoever labours under any of these possessions is as unfit for 

conversation as madmen in Bedlam.



I think I have gone over most of the errors in conversation that 

have fallen under my notice or memory, except some that are merely 

personal, and others too gross to need exploding; such as lewd or 

profane talk; but I pretend only to treat the errors of 

conversation in general, and not the several subjects of discourse, 

which would be infinite.  Thus we see how human nature is most 

debased, by the abuse of that faculty, which is held the great 

distinction between men and brutes; and how little advantage we 

make of that which might be the greatest, the most lasting, and the 

most innocent, as well as useful pleasure of life:  in default of 

which, we are forced to take up with those poor amusements of dress 

and visiting, or the more pernicious ones of play, drink, and 

vicious amours, whereby the nobility and gentry of both sexes are 

entirely corrupted both in body and mind, and have lost all notions 

of love, honour, friendship, and generosity; which, under the name 

of fopperies, have been for some time laughed out of doors.



This degeneracy of conversation, with the pernicious consequences 

thereof upon our humours and dispositions, hath been owing, among 

other causes, to the custom arisen, for some time past, of 

excluding women from any share in our society, further than in 

parties at play, or dancing, or in the pursuit of an amour.  I take 

the highest period of politeness in England (and it is of the same 

date in France) to have been the peaceable part of King Charles 

I.'s reign; and from what we read of those times, as well as from 

the accounts I have formerly met with from some who lived in that 

court, the methods then used for raising and cultivating 

conversation were altogether different from ours; several ladies, 

whom we find celebrated by the poets of that age, had assemblies at 

their houses, where persons of the best understanding, and of both 

sexes, met to pass the evenings in discoursing upon whatever 

agreeable subjects were occasionally started; and although we are 

apt to ridicule the sublime Platonic notions they had, or 

personated in love and friendship, I conceive their refinements 

were grounded upon reason, and that a little grain of the romance 

is no ill ingredient to preserve and exalt the dignity of human 

nature, without which it is apt to degenerate into everything that 

is sordid, vicious, and low.  If there were no other use in the 

conversation of ladies, it is sufficient that it would lay a 

restraint upon those odious topics of immodesty and indecencies, 

into which the rudeness of our northern genius is so apt to fall.  

And, therefore, it is observable in those sprightly gentlemen about 

the town, who are so very dexterous at entertaining a vizard mask 

in the park or the playhouse, that, in the company of ladies of 

virtue and honour, they are silent and disconcerted, and out of 

their element.



There are some people who think they sufficiently acquit themselves 

and entertain their company with relating of facts of no 

consequence, nor at all out of the road of such common incidents as 

happen every day; and this I have observed more frequently among 

the Scots than any other nation, who are very careful not to omit 

the minutest circumstances of time or place; which kind of 

discourse, if it were not a little relieved by the uncouth terms 

and phrases, as well as accent and gesture peculiar to that 

country, would be hardly tolerable.  It is not a fault in company 

to talk much; but to continue it long is certainly one; for, if the 

majority of those who are got together be naturally silent or 

cautious, the conversation will flag, unless it be often renewed by 

one among them who can start new subjects, provided he doth not 

dwell upon them, but leaveth room for answers and replies.
