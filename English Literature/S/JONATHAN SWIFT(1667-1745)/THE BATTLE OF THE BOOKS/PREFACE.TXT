SATIRE is a sort of glass wherein beholders do generally discover 

everybody's face but their own; which is the chief reason for that 

kind reception it meets with in the world, and that so very few are 

offended with it.  But, if it should happen otherwise, the danger 

is not great; and I have learned from long experience never to 

apprehend mischief from those understandings I have been able to 

provoke:  for anger and fury, though they add strength to the 

sinews of the body, yet are found to relax those of the mind, and 

to render all its efforts feeble and impotent.



There is a brain that will endure but one scumming; let the owner 

gather it with discretion, and manage his little stock with 

husbandry; but, of all things, let him beware of bringing it under 

the lash of his betters, because that will make it all bubble up 

into impertinence, and he will find no new supply.  Wit without 

knowledge being a sort of cream, which gathers in a night to the 

top, and by a skilful hand may be soon whipped into froth; but once 

scummed away, what appears underneath will be fit for nothing but 

to be thrown to the hogs.
