	Hame came our gudeman at e'en,
	  And hame came he,
	And there he saw a man
	  Where a man suldna be.
	``How's this now, kimmer?
	  How's this?'' quo he,---
	``How came this carle here
	  Without the leave o' me?''
				Old Song.



  The magistrate took the light out of the servant-maid's hand,
and advanced to his scrutiny, like Diogenes in the street of
Athens, lantern-in-hand, and probably with as little expectation
as that of the cynic, that he was likely to encounter any especial
treasure in the course of his researches. The first whom he
approached was my mysterious guide, who, seated on a table as
I have already described him, with his eyes firmly fixed on the
wall, his features arranged into the utmost inflexibility of
expression, his hands folded on his breast with an air betwixt
carelessness and defiance, his heel patting against the foot of the
table, to keep time with the tune which he continued to whistle,
submitted to Mr. Jarvie's investigation with an air of absolute
confidence and assurance which, for a moment, placed at fault
the memory and sagacity of the acute investigator.

  ``Ah!---Eh!---Oh!'' exclaimed the Bailie. ``My conscience!
---it's impossible!---and yet---no!---Conscience!---it canna be!
---and yet again---Deil hae me, that I suld say sae!---Ye robber
---ye cateran---ye born deevil that ye are, to a' bad ends and nae
gude ane!---can this be you?''

  ``E'en as ye see, Bailie,'' was the laconic answer.

  ``Conscience! if I am na clean bumbaized---_you_, ye cheat-the-wuddy
rogue---_you_ here on your venture in the tolbooth o' Glasgow?
---What d'ye think's the value o' your head?''

  ``Umph!---why, fairly weighed, and Dutch weight, it might
weigh down one provost's, four bailies', a town-clerk's, six deacons',
besides stent-masters' ''------

  ``Ah, ye reiving villain!'' interrupted Mr. Jarvie. ``But tell
ower your sins, and prepare ye, for if I say the word''------

  ``True, Bailie,'' said he who was thus addressed, folding his
hands behind him with the utmost _nonchalance,_ ``but ye will
never say that word.''

  ``And why suld I not, sir?'' exclaimed the magistrate---``Why
suld I not? Answer me that---why suld I not?''

  ``For three sufficient reasons, Bailie Jarvie.---First, for auld
langsyne; second, for the sake of the auld wife ayont the fire at
Stuckavrallachan, that made some mixture of our bluids, to my
own proper shame be it spoken! that has a cousin wi' accounts,
and yarn winnles, and looms and shuttles, like a mere mechanical
person; and lastly, Bailie, because if I saw a sign o' your betraying
me, I would plaster that wa' with your harns ere the hand
of man could rescue you!''

  ``Ye're a bauld desperate villain, sir,'' retorted the undaunted
Bailie; ``and ye ken that I ken ye to be sae, and that I wadna
stand a moment for my ain risk.''

  ``I ken weel,'' said the other, ``ye hae gentle bluid in your
veins, and I wad be laith to hurt my ain kinsman. But I'll
gang out here as free as I came in, or the very wa's o' Glasgow
tolbooth shall tell o't these ten years to come.''

  ``Weel, weel,'' said Mr. Jarvie, ``bluid's thicker than water;
and it liesna in kith, kin, and ally, to see motes in ilka other's
een if other een see them no. It wad be sair news to the auld
wife below the Ben of Stuckavrallachan, that you, ye Hieland
limmer, had knockit out my harns, or that I had kilted you up
in a tow. But ye'll own, ye dour deevil, that were it no your
very sell, I wad hae grippit the best man in the Hielands.''

  ``Ye wad hae tried, cousin,'' answered my guide, ``that I wot
weel; but I doubt ye wad hae come aff wi' the short measure;
for we gang-there-out Hieland bodies are an unchancy generation
when you speak to us o' bondage. We downa bide the coercion
of gude braid-claith about our hinderlans, let a be breeks o' free-stone,
and garters o' iron.''

  ``Ye'll find the stane breeks and the airn garters---ay, and
the hemp cravat, for a' that, neighbour,'' replied the Bailie.

  ``Nae man in a civilised country ever played the pliskies ye hae
done---but e'en pickle in your ain pock-neuk---I hae gi'en ye
wanting.''

  ``Well, cousin,'' said the other, ``ye'll wear black at my
burial.''

  ``Deil a black cloak will be there, Robin, but the corbies
and the hoodie-craws, I'se gie ye my hand on that. But whar's
the gude thousand pund Scots that I lent ye, man, and when
am I to see it again?''

  ``Where it is,'' replied my guide, after the affectation of considering
for a moment, ``I cannot justly tell---probably where
last year's snaw is.''

  ``And that's on the tap of Schehallion, ye Hieland dog,''
said Mr. Jarvie; ``and I look for payment frae you where ye
stand.''

  ``Ay,'' replied the Highlander, ``but I keep neither snaw nor
dollars in my sporran. And as to when you'll see it---why, just
when the king enjoys his ain again, as the auld sang says.''

  ``Warst of a', Robin,'' retorted the Glaswegian,---``I mean,
ye disloyal traitor---Warst of a'!---Wad ye bring popery in on
us, and arbitrary power, and a foist and a warming-pan, and
the set forms, and the curates, and the auld enormities o' surplices
and cerements? Ye had better stick to your auld trade
o' theft-boot, black-mail, spreaghs, and gillravaging---better
stealing nowte than ruining nations.''

  ``Hout, man---whisht wi' your whiggery,'' answered the Celt;
``we hae ken'd ane anither mony a lang day. I'se take care
your counting-room is no cleaned out when the Gillon-a-naillie<*>

* The lads with the kilts or petticoats.

come to redd up the Glasgow buiths, and clear them o' their
auld shop-wares. And, unless it just fa' in the preceese way o'
your duty, ye maunna see me oftener, Nicol, than I am disposed
to be seen.''

  ``Ye are a dauring villain, Rob,'' answered the Bailie; ``and
ye will be hanged, that will be seen and heard tell o'; but I'se
ne'er be the ill bird and foul my nest, set apart strong necessity
and the skreigh of duty, which no man should hear and be
inobedient. And wha the deevil's this?'' he continued, turning
to me---``Some gillravager that ye hae listed, I daur say. He
looks as if he had a bauld heart to the highway, and a lang
craig for the gibbet.''

  ``This, good Mr. Jarvie,'' said Owen, who, like myself, had
been struck dumb during this strange recognition, and no less
strange dialogue, which took place betwixt these extraordinary
kinsmen---``This, good Mr. Jarvie, is young Mr. Frank Osbaldistone,
only child of the head of our house, who should have
been taken into our firm at the time Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone,
his cousin, had the luck to be taken into it''---(Here Owen
could not suppress a groan)---``But howsoever''------

  ``Oh, I have heard of that smaik,'' said the Scotch merchant,
interrupting him; ``it is he whom your principal, like an
obstinate auld fule, wad make a merchant o', wad he or wad he
no,---and the lad turned a strolling stage-player, in pure dislike
to the labour an honest man should live by. Weel, sir, what
say you to your handiwork? Will Hamlet the Dane, or Hamlet's
ghost, be good security for Mr. Owen, sir?''

  ``I don't deserve your taunt,'' I replied, ``though I respect
your motive, and am too grateful for the assistance you have
afforded Mr. Owen, to resent it. My only business here was to
do what I could (it is perhaps very little) to aid Mr. Owen in
the management of my father's affairs. My dislike of the commercial
profession is a feeling of which I am the best and sole
judge.''

  ``I protest,'' said the Highlander, ``I had some respect for
this callant even before I ken'd what was in him; but now I
honour him for his contempt of weavers and spinners, and sic-like
mechanical persons and their pursuits.''

  ``Ye're mad, Rob,'' said the Bailie---``mad as a March hare
---though wherefore a hare suld be mad at March mair than at
Martinmas, is mair than I can weel say. Weavers! Deil shake
ye out o' the web the weaver craft made. Spinners! ye'll spin
and wind yourself a bonny pirn. And this young birkie here,
that ye're hoying and hounding on the shortest road to the
gallows and the deevil, will his stage-plays and his poetries help
him here, dye think, ony mair than your deep oaths and drawn
dirks, ye reprobate that ye are?---Will _Tityre tu patul<ae>,_ as they
ca' it, tell him where Rashleigh Osbaldistone is?, or Macbeth,
and all his kernes and galla-glasses, and your awn to boot, Rob,
procure him five thousand pounds to answer the bills which fall
due ten days hence, were they a' rouped at the Cross,---basket-hilts,
Andra-Ferraras, leather targets, brogues, brochan, and
sporrans?''

  ``Ten days,'' I answered, and instinctively drew out Diana
Vernon's packet; and the time being elapsed during which I
was to keep the seal sacred, I hastily broke it open. A sealed
letter fell from a blank enclosure, owing to the trepidation with
which I opened the parcel. A slight current of wind, which
found its way through a broken pane of the window, wafted the
letter to Mr. Jarvie's feet, who lifted it, examined the address
with unceremonious curiosity, and, to my astonishment, handed
it  to his Highland kinsman, saying, ``Here's a wind has blown
a letter to its right owner, though there were ten thousand
chances against its coming to hand.''

  The Highlander, having examined the address, broke the
letter open without the least ceremony. I endeavoured to
interrupt his proceeding.

  ``You must satisfy me, sir,'' said I, ``that the letter is intended
for you before I can permit you to peruse it.''

  ``Make yourself quite easy, Mr. Osbaldistone,'' replied the
mountaineer with great composure.---``remember Justice Inglewood,
Clerk Jobson, Mr. Morris---above all, remember your
vera humble servant, Robert Cawmil, and the beautiful Diana
Vernon. Remember all this, and doubt no longer that the
letter is for me.''

  I remained astonished at my own stupidity.---Through the
whole night, the voice, and even the features of this man, though
imperfectly seen, haunted me with recollections to which I could
assign no exact local or personal associations. But now the
light dawned on me at once; this man was Campbell himself.
His whole peculiarities flashed on me at once,---the deep strong
voice---the inflexible, stern, yet considerate cast of features---
the Scottish brogue, with its corresponding dialect and imagery,
which, although he possessed the power at times of laying them
aside, recurred at every moment of emotion, and gave pith to
his sarcasm, or vehemence to his expostulation. Rather beneath
the middle size than above it, his limbs were formed upon the
very strongest model that is consistent with agility, while from
the remarkable ease and freedom of his movements, you could
not doubt his possessing the latter quality in a high degree of
perfection. Two points in his person interfered with the rules
of symmetry; his shoulders were so broad in proportion to his
height, as, notwithstanding the lean and lathy appearance of
his frame, gave him something the air of being too square in
respect to his stature; and his arms, though round, sinewy, and
strong, were so very long as to be rather a deformity. I afterwards
heard that this length of arm was a circumstance on
which he prided himself; that when he wore his native Highland
garb, he could tie the garters of his hose without stooping;
and that it gave him great advantage in the use of the broad-sword,
at which he was very dexterous. But certainly this
want of symmetry destroyed the claim he might otherwise have
set up, to be accounted a very handsome man; it gave something
wild, irregular, and, as it were, unearthly, to his appearance,
and reminded me involuntarily of the tales which Mabel
used to tell of the old Picts who ravaged Northumberland in
ancient times, who, according to her tradition, were a sort of
half-goblin half-human beings, distinguished, like this man, for
courage, cunning, ferocity, the length of their arms, and the
squareness of their shoulders.

  When, however, I recollected the circumstances in which we
formerly met, I could not doubt that the billet was most probably
designed for him. He had made a marked figure among
those mysterious personages over whom Diana seemed to exercise
an influence, and from whom she experienced an influence
in her turn. It was painful to think that the fate of a being
so amiable was involved in that of desperadoes of this man's
description;---yet it seemed impossible to doubt it. Of what
use, however, could this person be to my father's affairs?---I
could think only of one. Rashleigh Osbaldistone had, at the
instigation of Miss Vernon, certainly found means to produce
Mr. Campbell when his presence was necessary to exculpate me
from Morris's accusation---Was it not possible that her influence,
in like manner, might prevail on Campbell to produce
Rashleigh? Speaking on this supposition, I requested to know
where my dangerous kinsman was, and when Mr. Campbell had
seen him. The answer was indirect.

  ``It's a kittle cast she has gien me to play; but yet it's fair
play, and I winna baulk her. Mr. Osbaldistone, I dwell not
very far from hence---my kinsman can show you the way---
Leave Mr. Owen to do the best he can in Glasgow---do you
come and see me in the glens, and it's like I may pleasure you,
and stead your father in his extremity. I am but a poor man;
but wit's better than wealth---and, cousin'' (turning from me
to address Mr. Jarvie), ``if ye daur venture sae muckle as to eat
a dish of Scotch collops, and a leg o' red-deer venison wi' me,
come ye wi' this Sassenach gentleman as far as Drymen or
Bucklivie,---or the Clachan of Aberfoil will be better than ony
o' them,---and I'll hae somebody waiting to weise ye the gate to
the place where I may be for the time---What say ye, man?
There's my thumb, I'll ne'er beguile thee.''

  ``Na, na, Robin,'' said the cautious burgher, ``I seldom like
to leave the Gorbals;<*> I have nae freedom to gang among your

* [The _Gorbals_ or ``suburbs'' are situate on the south side of the River.]

wild hills, Robin, and your kilted red-shanks---it disna become
my place, man.''

  ``The devil damn your place and you baith!'' reiterated
Campbell. ``The only drap o' gentle bluid that's in your body
was our great-grand-uncle's that was justified<*> at Dumbarton,

* [Executed for treason.]

and you set yourself up to say ye wad derogate frae your place
to visit me! Hark thee, man---I owe thee a day in harst---I'll
pay up your thousan pund Scots, plack and bawbee, gin ye'll be
an honest fallow for anes, and just daiker up the gate wi' this
Sassenach.''

  ``Hout awa' wi' your gentility,'' replied the Bailie; ``carry
your gentle bluid to the Cross, and see what ye'll buy wi't. But,
if I _were_ to come, wad ye really and soothfastly pay me the
siller?''

  ``I swear to ye,'' said the Highlander, ``upon the halidome of
him that sleeps beneath the grey stane at Inch-Cailleach.''<*>

* Inch-Cailleach is an island in Lochlomond, where the clan of MacGregor
* were wont to be interred, and where their sepulchres may still be
* seen. It formerly contained a nunnery: hence the name of lnch-Cailleach,
* or the island of Old Women.


  ``Say nae mair, Robin---say nae mair---We'll see what may
be dune. But ye maunna expect me to gang ower the Highland
line---I'll gae beyond the line at no rate. Ye maun meet me
about Bucklivie or the Clachan of Aberfoil,---and dinna forget
the needful.''

  ``Nae fear---nae fear,'' said Campbell; ``I'll be as true as the
steel blade that never failed its master. But I must be budging,
cousin, for the air o' Glasgow tolbooth is no that ower
salutary to a Highlander's constitution.''

  ``Troth,'' replied the merchant, ``and if my duty were to be
dune, ye couldna change your atmosphere, as the minister ca's
it, this ae wee while.---Ochon, that I sud ever be concerned in
aiding and abetting an escape frae justice! it will be a shame
and disgrace to me and mine, and my very father's memory, for
ever.''

  ``Hout tout, man! let that flee stick in the wa','' answered
his kinsman; ``when the dirt's dry it will rub out---Your
father, honest man, could look ower a friend's fault as weel as
anither.''

  ``Ye may be right, Robin,'' replied the Bailie, after a moment's
reflection; ``he was a considerate man the deacon; he
ken'd we had a' our frailties, and he lo'ed his friends---Ye'll no
hae forgotten him, Robin?'' This question he put in a softened
tone, conveying as much at least of the ludicrous as the pathetic.

  ``Forgotten him!'' replied his kinsman---``what suld ail me
to forget him?---a wapping weaver he was, and wrought my
first pair o' hose.---But come awa', kinsman,

	Come fill up my cap, come fill up my cann,
	Come saddle my horses, and call up my man;
	Come open your gates, and let me gae free,
	I daurna stay langer in bonny Dundee.''

  ``Whisht, sir!'' said the magistrate, in an authoritative tone
---``lilting and singing sae near the latter end o' the Sabbath!
This house may hear ye sing anither tune yet---Aweel, we hae
a' backslidings to answer for---Stanchells, open the door.''

  The jailor obeyed, and we all sallied forth. Stanchells looked
with some surprise at the two strangers, wondering, doubtless,
how they came into these premises without his knowledge; but
Mr. Jarvie's ``Friends o' mine, Stanchells---friends o' mine,''
silenced all disposition to inquiries. We now descended into
the lower vestibule, and hallooed more than once for Dougal, to
which summons no answer was returned; when Campbell
observed with a sardonic smile, ``That if Dougal was the lad he
kent him, he would scarce wait to get thanks for his ain share
of the night's wark, but was in all probability on the full trot
to the pass of Ballamaha''------

  ``And left us---and, abune a', me, mysell, locked up in the
tolbooth a' night!'' exclaimed the Bailie, in ire and perturbation.
``Ca' for forehammers, sledge-hammers, pinches, and
coulters; send for Deacon Yettlin, the smith, an let him ken
that Bailie Jarvie's shut up in the tolbooth by a Highland
blackguard, whom he'll hang up as high as Haman''------

  ``When ye catch him,'' said Campbell, gravely; ``but stay---
the door is surely not locked.''

  Indeed, on examination, we found that the door was not only
left open, but that Dougal in his retreat had, by carrying off the
keys along with him, taken care that no one should exercise his
office of porter in a hurry.

  ``He has glimmerings o' common sense now, that creature
Dougal,'' said Campbell.---``he ken'd an open door might hae
served me at a pinch.''

  We were by this time in the street.

  ``I tell you, Robin,'' said the magistrate, ``in my puir mind,
if ye live the life ye do, ye suld hae ane o' your gillies door-keeper
in every jail in Scotland, in case o' the warst.''

  ``Ane o' my kinsmen a bailie in ilka burgh will just do as
weel, cousin Nicol---So, gude-night or gude-morning to ye; and
forget not the Clachan of Aberfoil.''

  And without waiting for an answer, he sprung to the other
side of the street, and was lost in darkness. Immediately on
his disappearance, we heard him give a low whistle of peculiar
modulation, which was instantly replied to.

  ``Hear to the Hieland deevils,'' said Mr. Jarvie; ``they think
themselves on the skirts of Benlomond already, where they may
gang whewingand whistling about without minding Sunday or
Saturday.'' Here he was interrupted by something which fell
with a heavy clash on the street before us---``Gude guide us
what's this mair o't?---Mattie, haud up the lantern---Conscience
if it isna the keys!---Weel, that's just as weel---they cost the
burgh siller, and there might hae been some clavers about
the loss o' them. O, an Bailie Grahame were to get word o'
this night's job, it would be a sair hair in my neck!''

  As we were still but a few steps from the tolbooth door, we
carried back these implements of office, and consigned them to
the head jailor, who, in lieu of the usual mode of making good
his post by turning the keys, was keeping sentry in the vestibule
till the arrival of some assistant, whom he had summoned in
order to replace the Celtic fugitive Dougal.

  Having discharged this piece of duty to the burgh, and my
road lying the same way with the honest magistrate's, I profited
by the light of his lantern, and he by my arm, to find our way
through the streets, which, whatever they may now be, were
then dark, uneven, and ill-paved. Age is easily propitiated by
attentions from the young. The Bailie expressed himself interested
in me, and added, ``That since I was nane o' that play-acting
and play-ganging generation, whom his saul hated, he
wad be glad if I wad eat a reisted haddock or a fresh herring,
at breakfast wi' him the morn, and meet my friend, Mr. Owen,
whom, by that time, he would place at liberty.''

  ``My dear sir,'' said I, when I had accepted of the invitation
with thanks, ``how could you possibly connect me with the
stage?''

  ``I watna,'' replied Mr. Jarvie;---``it was a bletherin' phrasin'
chield they ca' Fairservice, that cam at e'en to get an order to
send the crier through the toun for ye at skreigh o' day the
morn. He tell't me whae ye were, and how ye were sent frae
your father's house because ye wadna be a dealer, and that ye
mightna disgrace your family wi' ganging on the stage. Ane
Hammorgaw, our precentor, brought him here, and said he was
an auld acquaintance; but I sent them both away wi' a flae in
their lug for bringing me sic an errand, on sic a night. But I
see he's a fule-creature a'thegither, and clean mistaen about ye.
I like ye, man,'' he continued; ``I like a lad that will stand by his
friends in trouble---I aye did it mysell, and sae did the deacon
my father, rest and bless him! But ye suldna keep ower
muckle company wi' Hielandmen and thae wild cattle. Can a
man touch pitch and no be defiled?---aye mind that. Nae
doubt, the best and wisest may err---Once, twice, and thrice
have I backslidden, man, and dune three things this night---my
father wadna hae believed his een if he could hae looked up and
seen me do them.''

  He was by this time arrived at the door of his own dwelling.
He paused, however, on the threshold, and went on in a solemn
tone of deep contrition,---``Firstly, I hae thought my ain thoughts
on the Sabbath---secondly, I hae gi'en security for an Englishman
---and, in the third and last place, well-a-day! I hae let an ill-doer
escape from the place of imprisonment---But there's balm
in Gilead, Mr. Osbaldistone---Mattie, I can let mysell in---see
Mr. Osbaldistone to Luckie Flyter's, at the corner o' the wynd.
---Mr. Osbaldistone''---in a whisper---``ye'll offer nae incivility
to Mattie---she's an honest man's daughter, and a near cousin
o' the Laird o' Limmerfield's.''
