	Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
	The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent
	When we have chid the hasty-footed time
	For parting us---Oh!---and is all forgot?
				Midsummer Night's Dream.

  We have been a long while in conducting Butler to the door of
the cottage at St. Leonard's; yet the space which we have occupied
in the preceding narrative does not exceed in length that
which he actually spent on Salisbury Crags on the morning
which succeeded the execution done upon Porteous by the
rioters. For this delay he had his own motives. He wished
to collect his thoughts, strangely agitated as they were, first by
the melancholy news of Effie Deans's situation, and afterwards
by the frightful scene which he had witnessed. In the situation
also in which he stood with respect to Jeanie and her
father, some ceremony, at least some choice of fitting time and
season, was necessary to wait upon them. Eight in the morning
was then the ordinary hour for breakfast, and he resolved that
it should arrive before he made his appearance in their cottage.

  Never did hours pass so heavily. Butler shifted his place
and enlarged his circle to while away the time, and heard the
huge bell of St. Giles's toll each successive hour in swelling
tones, which were instantly attested by those of the other
steeples in succession. He had heard seven struck in this
manner, when he began to think he might venture to approach
nearer to St. Leonard's, from which he was still a mile distant.
Accordingly he descended from his lofty station as low as the
bottom of the valley, which divides Salisbury Crags from those
small rocks which take their name from Saint Leonard. It is,
as many of my readers may know, a deep, wild, grassy valley,
scattered with huge rocks and fragments which have descended
from the cliffs and steep ascent to the east.

  This sequestered dell, as well as other places of the open
pasturage of the King's Park, was, about this time, often the
resort of the gallants of the time who had affairs of honour to
discuss with the sword. Duels were then very common in Scotland,
for the gentry were at once idle, haughty, fierce, divided
by faction, and addicted to intemperance, so that there lacked
neither provocation, nor inclination to resent it when given;
and the sword, which was part of every gentleman's dress, was
the only weapon used for the decision of such differences.
When, therefore, Butler observed a young man, skulking, apparently
to avoid observation, among the scattered rocks at
some distance from the footpath, he was naturally led to suppose
that he had sought this lonely spot upon that evil errand.
He was so strongly impressed with this, that, notwithstanding
his own distress of mind, he could not, according to his sense of
duty as a clergyman, pass this person without speaking to him.
There are times, thought he to himself, when the slightest
interference may avert a great calamity---when a word spoken
in season may do more for prevention than the eloquence of
Tully could do for remedying evil---And for my own griefs, be
they as they may, I shall feel them the lighter, if they divert
me not from the prosecution of my duty.

  Thus thinking and feeling, he quitted the ordinary path, and
advanced nearer the object he had noticed. The man at first
directed his course towards the hill, in order, as it appeared, to
avoid him; but when he saw that Butler seemed disposed to
follow him, he adjusted his hat fiercely, turned round, and came
forward, as if to meet and defy scrutiny.

  Butler had an opportunity of accurately studying his features
as they advanced slowly to meet each other. The stranger
seemed about twenty-five years old. His dress was of a kind
which could hardly be said to indicate his rank with certainty,
for it was such as young gentlemen sometimes wore while on
active exercise in the morning, and which, therefore, was imitated
by those of the inferior ranks, as young clerks and tradesmen,
because its cheapness rendered it attainable, while it
approached more nearly to the apparel of youths of fashion than
any other which the manners of the times permitted them to
wear. If his air and manner could be trusted, however, this
person seemed rather to be dressed under than above his rank;
for his carriage was bold and somewhat supercilious, his step
easy and free, his manner daring and unconstrained. His
stature was of the middle size, or rather above it, his limbs
well-proportioned, yet not so strong as to infer the reproach of
clumsiness. His features were uncommonly handsome, and all
about him would have been interesting and prepossessing but
for that indescribable expression which habitual dissipation gives
to the countenance, joined with a certain audacity in look and
manner, of that kind which is often assumed as a mask for confusion
and apprehension.

  Butler and the stranger met---surveyed each other---when, as
the latter, slightly touching his hat, was about to pass by him,
Butler, while he returned the salutation, observed, ``A fine
morning, sir---You are on the hill early.''

  ``I have business here,'' said the young man, in a tone meant
to repress farther inquiry.

  ``I do not doubt it, sir,'' said Butler. ``I trust you will
forgive my hoping that it is of a lawful kind?''

  ``Sir,'' said the other, with marked surprise, ``I never forgive
impertinence, nor can I conceive what title you have to hope
anything about what no way concerns you.''

  ``I am a soldier, sir,'' said Butler, ``and have a charge to
arrest evil-doers in the name of my Master.''

  ``A soldier!'' said the young man, stepping back, and fiercely
laying his hand on his sword---``A soldier, and arrest me! Did
you reckon what your life was worth, before you took the commission
upon you?''

  ``You mistake me, sir,'' said Butler, gravely; ``neither my
warfare nor my warrant are of this world. I am a preacher of
the gospel, and have power, in my Master's name, to command
the peace upon earth and good-will towards men, which was proclaimed
with the gospel.''

  ``A minister!'' said the stranger, carelessly, and with an expression
approaching to scorn. ``I know the gentlemen of your
cloth in Scotland claim a strange right of intermeddling with
men's private affairs. But I have been abroad, and know better
than to be priest-ridden.''

  ``Sir, if it be true that any of my cloth, or, it might be more
decently said, of my calling, interfere with men's private affairs,
for the gratification either of idle curiosity, or for worse motives,
you cannot have learned a better lesson abroad than to contemn
such practices. But in my Master's work, I am called to be
busy in season and out of season; and, conscious as I am of a
pure motive, it were better for me to incur your contempt for
speaking, than the correction of my own conscience for being
silent.''

  ``In the name of the devil!'' said the young man impatiently,
``say what you have to say, then; though whom you take me
for, or what earthly concern you have with me, a stranger to
you, or with my actions and motives, of which you can know
nothing, I cannot conjecture for an instant.''

  ``You are about,'' said Butler, ``to violate one of your country's
wisest laws---you are about, which is much more dreadful,
to violate a law, which God himself has implanted within our
nature, and written as it were, in the table of our hearts, to
which every thrill of our nerves is responsive.''

  ``And what is the law you speak of?'' said the stranger, in a
hollow and somewhat disturbed accent.

  ``Thou shalt do no =murder,='' said Butler, with a deep and
solemn voice.

  The young man visibly started, and looked considerably appalled.
Butler perceived he had made a favourable impression,
and resolved to follow it up. ``Think,'' he said, ``young man,''
laying his hand kindly upon the stranger's shoulder, ``what an
awful alternative you voluntarily choose for yourself, to kill or
be killed. Think what it is to rush uncalled into the presence
of an offended Deity, your heart fermenting with evil passions,
your hand hot from the steel you had been urging, with your
best skill and malice, against the breast of a fellow-creature.
Or, suppose yourself the scarce less wretched survivor, with the
guilt of Cain, the first murderer, in your heart, with the stamp
upon your brow---that stamp which struck all who gazed on
him with unutterable horror, and by which the murderer is made
manifest to all who look upon him. Think''------

  The stranger gradually withdrew himself from under the hand
of his monitor; and, pulling his hat over his brows, thus interrupted
him. ``Your meaning, sir, I dare say, is excellent, but
you are throwing your advice away. I am not in this place
with violent intentions against any one. I may be bad enough
---you priests say all men are so---but I am here for the purpose
of saving life, not of taking it away. If you wish to spend
your time rather in doing a good action than in talking about
you know not what, I will give you an opportunity. Do you
see yonder crag to the right, over which appears the chimney of
a lone house? Go thither, inquire for one Jeanie Deans, the
daughter of the goodman; let her know that he she wots of
remained here from daybreak till this hour, expecting to see
her, and that he can abide no longer. Tell her, she _must_ meet
me at the Hunter's Bog to-night, as the moon rises behind St.
Anthony's Hill, or that she will make a desperate man of me.''

  ``Who or what are you,'' replied Butler, exceedingly and
most unpleasantly surprised, ``who charge me with such an
errand?''

  ``I am the devil!''---answered the young man hastily.

  Butler stepped instinctively back, and commanded himself
internally to Heaven; for, though a wise and strong-minded
man, he was neither wiser nor more strong-minded than those
of his age and education, with whom, to disbelieve witchcraft
or spectres, was held an undeniable proof of atheism.

  The stranger went on without observing his emotion. ``Yes!
call me Apollyon, Abaddon, whatever name you shall choose, as
a clergyman acquainted with the upper and lower circles of
spiritual denomination, to call me by, you shall not find an appellation
more odious to him that bears it, than is mine own.''

  This sentence was spoken with the bitterness of self-upbraiding,
and a contortion of visage absolutely demoniacal. Butler,
though a man brave by principle, if not by constitution, was
overawed; for intensity of mental distress has in it a sort of
sublimity which repels and overawes all men, but especially
those of kind and sympathetic dispositions. The stranger
turned abruptly from Butler as he spoke, but instantly returned,
and, coming up to him closely and boldly, said, in a fierce,
determined tone, ``I have told you who and what I am---who
and what are you? What is your name?''

  ``Butler,'' answered the person to whom this abrupt question
was addressed, surprised into answering it by the sudden and
fierce manner of the querist---``Reuben Butler, a preacher of
the gospel.''

  At this answer, the stranger again plucked more deep over
his brows the hat which he had thrown back in his former
agitation. ``Butler!'' he repeated---``the assistant of the
schoolmaster at Liberton?''

  ``The same,'' answered Butler composedly.

  The stranger covered his face with his hand, as if on sudden
reflection, and then turned away, but stopped when he had
walked a few paces; and seeing Butler follow him with his
eyes, called out in a stern yet suppressed tone, just as if he had
exactly calculated that his accents should not be heard a yard
beyond the spot on which Butler stood. ``Go your way, and
do mine errand. Do not look after me. I will neither descend
through the bowels of these rocks, nor vanish in a flash of fire;
and yet the eye that seeks to trace my motions shall have
reason to curse it was ever shrouded by eyelid or eyelash.
Begone, and look not behind you. Tell Jeanie Deans, that
when the moon rises I shall expect to meet her at Nicol
Muschat's Cairn, beneath Saint Anthony's Chapel.''

  As he uttered these words, he turned and took the road
against the hill, with a haste that seemed as peremptory as his
tone of authority.

  Dreading he knew not what of additional misery to a lot
which seemed little capable of receiving augmentation, and
desperate at the idea that any living man should dare to send
so extraordinary a request, couched in terms so imperious, to
the half-betrothed object of his early and only affection, Butler
strode hastily towards the cottage, in order to ascertain how far
this daring and rude gallant was actually entitled to press on
Jeanie Deans a request, which no prudent, and scarce any
modest young woman, was likely to comply with.

  Butler was by nature neither jealous nor superstitious; yet
the feelings which lead to those moods of the mind were rooted
in his heart, as a portion derived from the common stock of
humanity. It was maddening to think that a profligate gallant,
such as the manner and tone of the stranger evinced him to be,
should have it in his power to command forth his future bride
and plighted true love, at a place so improper, and an hour so
unseasonable. Yet the tone in which the stranger spoke had
nothing of the soft half-breathed voice proper to the seducer
who solicits an assignation; it was bold, fierce, and imperative,
and had less of love in it than of menace and intimidation.

  The suggestions of superstition seemed more plausible, had
Butler's mind been very accessible to them. Was this indeed
the Roaring Lion, who goeth about seeking whom he may
devour? This was a question which pressed itself on Butler's
mind with an earnestness that cannot be conceived by those
who live in the present day. The fiery eye, the abrupt demeanour,
the occasionally harsh, yet studiously subdued tone
of voice,---the features, handsome, but now clouded with pride,
now disturbed by suspicion, now inflamed with passion---those
dark hazel eyes which he sometimes shaded with his cap, as if
he were averse to have them seen while they were occupied with
keenly observing the motions and bearing of others---those eyes
that were now turbid with melancholy, now gleaming with
scorn, and now sparkling with fury---was it the passions of a
mere mortal they expressed, or the emotions of a fiend, who
seeks, and seeks in vain, to conceal his fiendish designs under
the borrowed mask of manly beauty? The whole partook of
the mien, language, and port of the ruined archangel; and,
imperfectly as we have been able to describe it, the effect of the
interview upon Butler's nerves, shaken as they were at the time
by the horrors of the preceding night, were greater than his
understanding warranted, or his pride cared to submit to. The
very place where he had met this singular person was desecrated,
as it were, and unhallowed, owing to many violent deaths, both
in duels and by suicide, which had in former times taken place
there; and the place which he had named as a rendezvous at so
late an hour, was held in general to be accursed, from a frightful
and cruel murder which had been there committed by the wretch
from whom the place took its name, upon the person of his own
wife.<*> It was in such places, according to the belief of that

period (when the laws against witchcraft were still in fresh
observance, and had even lately been acted upon), that evil
spirits had power to make themselves visible to human eyes,
and to practise upon the feelings and senses of mankind.
Suspicions, founded on such circumstances, rushed on Butler's
mind, unprepared as it was by any previous course of reasoning,
to deny that which all of his time, country, and profession
believed; but common sense rejected these vain ideas as inconsistent,
if not with possibility, at least with the general rules
by which the universe is governed,---a deviation from which, as
Butler well argued with himself, ought not to be admitted as
probable, upon any but the plainest and most incontrovertible
evidence. An earthly lover, however, or a young man, who,
from whatever cause, had the right of exercising such summary
and unceremonious authority over the object of his long-settled,
and apparently sincerely returned affection, was an object scarce
less appalling to his mind, than those which superstition
suggested.

  His limbs exhausted with fatigue, his mind harassed with
anxiety, and with painful doubts and recollections, Butler
dragged himself up the ascent from the valley to St. Leonard's
Crags, and presented himself at the door of Deans's habitation,
with feelings much akin to the miserable reflections and fears of
its inhabitants.
