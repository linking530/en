	I'll warrant that fellow from drowning, were 
	the ship no stronger than a nut-shell.
				The Tempest.


  Butler felt neither fatigue nor want of refreshment, although,
from the mode in which he had spent the night, he might well
have been overcome with either. But in the earnestness with
which he hastened to the assistance of the sister of Jeanie Deans,
he forgot both.

  In his first progress he walked with so rapid a pace as almost
approached to running, when he was surprised to hear behind
him a call upon his name, contending with an asthmatic cough,
and half-drowned amid the resounding trot of a Highland pony.
He looked behind, and saw the Laird of Dumbiedikes making
after him with what speed he might, for it happened, fortunately
for the Laird's purpose of conversing with Butler, that his own
road homeward was for about two hundred yards the same with
that which led by the nearest way to the city. Butler stopped
when he heard himself thus summoned, internally wishing no
good to the panting equestrian who thus retarded his journey.

  ``Uh! uh! uh!'' ejaculated Dumbiedikes, as he checked the
hobbling pace of the pony by our friend Butler. ``Uh! uh!
it's a hard-set willyard beast this o' mine.'' He had in fact
just overtaken the object of his chase at the very point beyond
which it would have been absolutely impossible for him to
have continued the pursuit, since there Butler's road parted
from that leading to Dumbiedikes, and no means of influence
or compulsion which the rider could possibly have used towards
his Bucephalus could have induced the Celtic obstinacy of Rory
Bean (such was the pony's name) to have diverged a yard from
the path that conducted him to his own paddock.

  Even when he had recovered from the shortness of breath
occasioned by a trot much more rapid than Rory or he were
accustomed to, the high purpose of Dumbiedikes seemed to
stick as it were in his throat, and impede his utterance, so that
Butler stood for nearly three minutes ere he could utter a
syllable; and when he did find voice, it was only to say, after
one or two efforts, ``Uh! uh! uhm! I say, Mr.---Mr. Butler,
it's a braw day for the har'st.''

  ``Fine day, indeed,'' said Butler. ``I wish you good morning,
sir.''

  ``Stay---stay a bit,'' rejoined Dumbiedikes; ``that was no
what I had gotten to say.''

  ``Then, pray be quick, and let me have your commands,''
rejoined Butler; ``I crave your pardon, but I am in haste, and
_Tempus nemini_---you know the proverb.''

  Dumbiedikes did not know the proverb, nor did he even take
the trouble to endeavour to look as if he did, as others in his
place might have done. He was concentrating all his intellects
for one grand proposition, and could not afford any detachment
to defend outposts. ``I say, Mr. Butler,'' said he, ``ken ye if
Mr. Saddletree's a great lawyer?''

  ``I have no person's word for it but his own,'' answered
Butler, drily; ``but undoubtedly he best understands his own
qualities.''

  ``Umph!'' replied the taciturn Dumbiedikes, in a tone which
seemed to say, ``Mr. Butler, I take your meaning.'' ``In that
case,'' he pursued, ``I'll employ my ain man o' business, Nichil
Novit (auld Nichil's son, and amaist as gleg as his father), to
agent Effie's plea.''

  And having thus displayed more sagacity than Butler expected
from him, he courteously touched his gold-laced cocked
hat, and by a punch on the ribs, conveyed to Rory Bean, it was
his rider's pleasure that he should forthwith proceed homewards;
a hint which the quadruped obeyed with that degree of alacrity
with which men and animals interpret and obey suggestions
that entirely correspond with their own inclinations.

  Butler resumed his pace, not without a momentary revival
of that jealousy which the honest Laird's attention to the family
of Deans had at different times excited in his bosom. But he
was too generous long to nurse any feeling which was allied to
selfishness. ``He is,'' said Butler to himself, ``rich in what I
want; why should I feel vexed that he has the heart to dedicate
some of his pelf to render them services, which I can only form
the empty wish of executing? In God's name, let us each do
what we can. May she be but happy!---saved from the misery
and disgrace that seems impending---Let me but find the
means of preventing the fearful experiment of this evening,
and farewell to other thoughts, though my heart-strings break
in parting with them!''

  He redoubled his pace, and soon stood before the door of the
Tolbooth, or rather before the entrance where the door had
formerly been placed. His interview with the mysterious
stranger, the message to Jeanie, his agitating conversation with
her on the subject of breaking off their mutual engagements,
and the interesting scene with old Deans, had so entirely occupied
his mind as to drown even recollection of the tragical
event which he had witnessed the preceding evening. His
attention was not recalled to it by the groups who stood scattered
on the street in conversation, which they hushed when
strangers approached, or by the bustling search of the agents
of the city police, supported by small parties of the military,
or by the appearance of the Guard-House, before which were
treble sentinels, or, finally, by the subdued and intimidated
looks of the lower orders of society, who, conscious that they
were liable to suspicion, if they were not guilty of accession to
a riot likely to be strictly inquired into, glided about with an
humble and dismayed aspect, like men whose spirits being
exhausted in the revel and the dangers of a desperate debauch
over-night, are nerve-shaken, timorous, and unenterprising on
the succeeding day.

  None of these symptoms of alarm and trepidation struck
Butler, whose mind was occupied with a different, and to him
still more interesting subject, until he stood before the entrance
to the prison, and saw it defended by a double file of grenadiers,
instead of bolts and bars. Their ``Stand, stand!'' the blackened
appearance of the doorless gateway, and the winding
staircase and apartments of the Tolbooth, now open to the
public eye, recalled the whole proceedings of the eventful night.
Upon his requesting to speak with Effie Deans, the same tall,
thin, silver-haired turnkey, whom he had seen on the preceding
evening, made his appearance,

  ``I think,'' he replied to Butler's request of admission, with
true Scottish indirectness, ``ye will be the same lad that was
for in to see her yestreen?''

  Butler admitted he was the same person.

  ``And I am thinking,'' pursued the turnkey, ``that ye speered
at me when we locked up, and if we locked up earlier on account
of Porteous?''

  ``Very likely I might make some such observation,'' said
Butler; ``but the question now is, can I see Effie Deans?''

  ``I dinna ken---gang in by, and up the turnpike stair, and
turn till the ward on the left hand.''

  The old man followed close behind him, with his keys in his
hand, not forgetting even that huge one which had once opened
and shut the outward gate of his dominions, though at present
it was but an idle and useless burden. No sooner had Butler
entered the room to which he was directed, than the experienced
hand of the warder selected the proper key, and locked it on
Rthe outside. At first Butler conceived this man<oe>uvre was only
an effect of the man's habitual and official caution and jealousy.
But when he heard the hoarse command, ``Turn out the guard!''
and immediately afterwards heard the clash of a sentinel's arms,
as he was posted at the door of his apartment, he again called
out to the turnkey, ``My good friend, I have business of some
consequence with Effie Deans, and I beg to see her as soon as
possible.'' No answer was returned. ``If it be against your
rules to admit me,'' repeated Butler, in a still louder tone, ``to see
the prisoner, I beg you will tell me so, and let me go about my
business.---_Fugit irrevocabile tempus!_'' muttered he to himself.

  ``If ye had business to do, ye suld hae dune it before ye cam
here,'' replied the man of keys from the outside; ``yell find it's
easier wunnin in than wunnin out here---there's sma' likelihood
o' another Porteous mob coming to rabble us again---the law
will haud her ain now, neighbour, and that yell find to your
cost.''

  ``What do you mean by that, sir?'' retorted Butler. ``You
must mistake me for some other person. My name is Reuben
Butler, preacher of the gospel.''

  ``I ken that weel eneugh,'' said the turnkey.

  ``Well, then, if you know me, I have a right to know from
you in return, what warrant you have for detaining me; that, I
know, is the right of every British subject.''

  ``Warrant!'' said the jailor,---``the warrant's awa to Libberton
wi' twa sheriff officers seeking ye. If ye had staid at hame,
as honest men should do, ye wad hae seen the warrant; but if
ye come to be incarcerated of your ain accord, wha can help it,
my jo?''

  ```So I cannot see Effie Deans, then,'' said Butler; ``and you
are determined not to let me out?''

  ``Troth will I no, neighbour,'' answered the old man, doggedly;
``as for Effie Deans, ye'll hae eneuch ado to mind your
ain business, and let her mind hers; and for letting you out,
that maun be as the magistrate will determine. And fare ye
weel for a bit, for I maun see Deacon Sawyers put on ane or
twa o' the doors that your quiet folk broke down yesternight,
Mr. Butler.''

  There was something in this exquisitely provoking, but there
was also something darkly alarming. To be imprisoned, even
on a false accusation, has something in it disagreeable and
menacing even to men of more constitutional courage than
Butler had to boast; for although he had much of that resolution
which arises from a sense of duty and an honourable desire
to discharge it, yet, as his imagination was lively, and his frame
of body delicate, he was far from possessing that cool insensibility
to danger which is the happy portion of men of stronger
health, more firm nerves, and less acute sensibility. An indistinct
idea of peril, which he could neither understand nor ward
off, seemed to float before his eyes. He tried to think over the
events of the preceding night, in hopes of discovering some
means of explaining or vindicating his conduct for appearing
among the mob, since it immediately occurred to him that his
detention must be founded on that circumstance. And it was
with anxiety that he found he could not recollect to have been
under the observation of any disinterested witness in the attempts
that he made from time to time to expostulate with the rioters,
and to prevail on them to release him. The distress of Deans's
family, the dangerous rendezvous which Jeanie had formed, and
which he could not now hope to interrupt, had also their share
in his unpleasant reflections. Yet, impatient as he was to
receive an _<e'>claircissement_ upon the cause of his confinement,
and if possible to obtain his liberty, he was affected with a
trepidation which seemed no good omen; when, after remaining
an hour in this solitary apartment, he received a summons to
attend the sitting magistrate. He was conducted from prison
strongly guarded by a party of soldiers, with a parade of precaution,
that, however ill-timed and unnecessary, is generally
displayed _after_ an event, which such precaution, if used in time,
might have prevented.

  He was introduced into the Council Chamber, as the place
is called where the magistrates hold their sittings, and which
was then at a little distance from the prison. One or two of
the senators of the city were present, and seemed about to
engage in the examination of an individual who was brought
forward to the foot of the long green-covered table round which
the council usually assembled. ``Is that the preacher?'' said
one of the magistrates, as the city officer in attendance introduced
Butler. The man answered in the affirmative. ``Let
him sit down there for an instant; we will finish this man's
business very briefly.''

  ``Shall we remove Mr. Butler?'' queried the assistant.

  ``It is not necessary---Let him remain where he is.''

  Butler accordingly sate down on a bench at the bottom of the
apartment, attended by one of his keepers.

  It was a large room, partially and imperfectly lighted; but
by chance, or the skill of the architect, who might happen to
remember the advantage which might occasionally be derived
from such an arrangement, one window was so placed as to
throw a strong light at the foot of the table at which prisoners
were usually posted for examination, while the upper end, where
the examinants sate, was thrown into shadow. Butler's eyes
were instantly fixed on the person whose examination was at
present proceeding, in the idea that he might recognise some
one of the conspirators of the former night. But though the
features of this man were sufficiently marked and striking, he
could not recollect that he had ever seen them before.

  The complexion of this person was dark, and his age somewhat
advanced. He wore his own hair, combed smooth down,
and cut very short. It was jet black, slightly curled by nature,
and already mottled with grey. The man's face expressed
rather knavery than vice, and a disposition to sharpness, cunning,
and roguery, more than the traces of stormy and indulged
passions. His sharp quick black eyes, acute features, ready
sardonic smile, promptitude and effrontery, gave him altogether
what is called among the vulgar a _knowing_ look, which generally
implies a tendency to knavery. At a fair or market, you
could not for a moment have doubted that he was a horse-jockey,
intimate with all the tricks of his trade; yet, had you
met him on a moor, you would not have apprehended any
violence from him. His dress was also that of a horse-dealer---
a close-buttoned jockey-coat, or wrap-rascal, as it was then
termed, with huge metal buttons, coarse blue upper stockings,
called boot-hose because supplying the place of boots, and a
slouched hat. He only wanted a loaded whip under his arm
and a spur upon one heel, to complete the dress of the character
he seemed to represent.

  ``Your name is James Ratcliffe?'' said the magistrate.

  ``Ay---always wi' your honour's leave.''

  ``That is to say, you could find me another name if I did not
like that one?''

  ``Twenty to pick and choose upon, always with your honour's
leave,'' resumed the respondent.

  ``But James Ratcliffe is your present name?---what is your
trade?''

  ``I canna just say, distinctly, that I have what ye wad ca'
preceesely a trade.''

  ``But,'' repeated the magistrate, ``what are your means of
living---your occupation?''

  ``Hout tout---your honour, wi' your leave, kens that as weel
as I do,'' replied the examined.

  ``No matter, I want to hear you describe it,'' said the
examinant.

  ``Me describe!---and to your honour!---far be it from Jemmie
Ratcliffe,'' responded the prisoner.

  ``Come, sir, no trifling---I insist on an answer.''

  ``Weel, sir,'' replied the declarant, ``I maun make a clean
breast, for ye see, wi' your leave, I am looking for favour---
Describe my occupation, quo' ye?---troth it will be ill to do that,
in a feasible way, in a place like this---but what is't again that
the aught command says?''

  ``Thou shalt not steal,'' answered the magistrate.

  ``Are you sure o' that?'' replied the accused.---``Troth, then,
my occupation, and that command, are sair at odds, for I read
it, thou _shalt_ steal; and that makes an unco difference, though
there's but a wee bit word left out.''

  ``To cut the matter short, Ratcliffe, you have been a most
notorious thief,'' said the examinant.

  ``I believe Highlands and Lowlands ken that, sir, forby
England and Holland,'' replied Ratcliffe, with the greatest composure
and effrontery.

  ``And what d'ye think the end of your calling will be?'' said
the magistrate.

  ``I could have gien a braw guess yesterday---but I dinna ken
sae weel the day,'' answered the prisoner.

  ``And what would you have said would have been your end,
had you been asked the question yesterday?''

  ``Just the gallows,'' replied Ratcliffe, with the same composure.

  ``You are a daring rascal, sir,'' said the magistrate; ``and
how dare you hope times are mended with you to-day?''

  ``Dear, your honour,'' answered Ratcliffe, ``there's muckle
difference between lying in prison under sentence of death, and
staying there of ane's ain proper accord, when it would have
cost a man naething to get up and rin awa---what was to hinder
me from stepping out quietly, when the rabble walked awa wi'
Jock Porteous yestreen?---and does your honour really think I
staid on purpose to be hanged?''

  ``I do not know what you may have proposed to yourself;
but I know,'' said the magistrate, ``what the law proposes for
you, and that is, to hang you next Wednesday eight days.''

  ``Na, na, your honour,'' said Ratcliffe firmly, ``craving your
honour's pardon, I'll ne'er believe that till I see it. I have
kend the law this mony a year, and mony a thrawart job I hae
had wi' her first and last; but the auld jaud is no sae ill as that
comes to---I aye fand her bark waur than her bite.''

  ``And if you do not expect the gallows, to which you are
condemned (for the fourth time to my knowledge), may I beg
the favour to know,'' said the magistrate, ``what it is you _do_
expect, in consideration of your not having taken your flight
with the rest of the jail-birds, which I will admit was a line of
conduct little to have been expected?''

  ``I would never have thought for a moment of staying in
that auld gousty toom house,'' answered Ratcliffe, ``but that use
and wont had just gien me a fancy to the place, and I'm just
expecting a bit post in't.''

  ``A post!'' exclaimed the magistrate; ``a whipping-post, I
suppose, you mean?''

  ``Na, na, sir, I had nae thoughts o' a whuppin-post. After
having been four times doomed to hang by the neck till I was
dead, I think I am far beyond being whuppit.''

  ``Then, in Heaven's name, what _did_ you expect?''

  ``Just the post of under-turnkey, for I understand there's a
vacancy,'' said the prisoner; ``I wadna think of asking the
lockman's<*> place ower his head; it wadna suit me sae weel as

* Note H. Hangman, or Lockman.

ither folk, for I never could put a beast out o' the way, much
less deal wi' a man.''

  ``That's something in your favour,'' said the magistrate, making
exactly the inference to which Ratcliffe was desirous to lead
him, though he mantled his art with an affectation of oddity.

  ``But,'' continued the magistrate, ``how do you think you can
be trusted with a charge in the prison, when you have broken
at your own hand half the jails in Scotland?''

  ``Wi' your honour's leave,'' said Ratcliffe, ``if I kend sae
weel how to wun out mysell, it's like I wad be a' the better a
hand to keep other folk in. I think they wad ken their business
weel that held me in when I wanted to be out, or wan out
when I wanted to hand them in.''

  The remark seemed to strike the magistrate, but he made no
further immediate observation, only desired Ratcliffe to be
removed.

  When this daring and yet sly freebooter was out of hearing,
the magistrate asked the city clerk, ``what he thought of the
fellow's assurance?''

  ``It's no for me to say, sir,'' replied the clerk; ``but if James
Ratcliffe be inclined to turn to good, there is not a man e'er
came within the ports of the burgh could be of sae muckle use
to the Good Town in the thief and lock-up line of business.
I'll speak to Mr. Sharpitlaw about him.''

  Upon Ratcliffe's retreat, Butler was placed at the table for
examination. The magistrate conducted his inquiry civilly,
but yet in a manner which gave him to understand that he
laboured under strong suspicion. With a frankness which at
once became his calling and character, Butler avowed his involuntary
presence at the murder of Porteous, and, at the
request of the magistrate, entered into a minute detail of the
circumstances which attended that unhappy affair. All the
particulars, such as we have narrated, were taken minutely
down by the clerk from Butler's dictation.

  When the narrative was concluded, the cross-examination
commenced, which it is a painful task even for the most candid
witness to undergo, since a story, especially if connected with
agitating and alarming incidents, can scarce be so clearly and
distinctly told, but that some ambiguity and doubt may be
thrown upon it by a string of successive and minute interrogatories.

  The magistrate commenced by observing, that Butler had
said his object was to return to the village of Libberton, but
that he was interrupted by the mob at the West Port. ``Is
the West Port your usual way of leaving town when you go to
Libberton?'' said the magistrate, with a sneer.

  ``No, certainly,'' answered Butler, with the haste of a man
anxious to vindicate the accuracy of his evidence; ``but I
chanced to be nearer that port than any other, and the hour of
shutting the gates was on the point of striking.''

  ``That was unlucky,'' said the magistrate, drily. ``Pray,
being, as you say, under coercion and fear of the lawless multitude,
and compelled to accompany them through scenes
disagreeable to all men of humanity, and more especially irreconcilable
to the profession of a minister, did you not attempt
to struggle, resist, or escape from their violence?''

  Butler replied, ``that their numbers prevented him from
attempting resistance, and their vigilance from effecting his
escape.''

  ``That was unlucky,'' again repeated the magistrate, in the
same dry inacquiescent tone of voice and manner. He proceeded
with decency and politeness, but with a stiffness which
argued his continued suspicion, to ask many questions concerning
the behaviour of the mob, the manners and dress of the
ringleaders; and when he conceived that the caution of Butler,
if he was deceiving him, must be lulled asleep, the magistrate
suddenly and artfully returned to former parts of his declaration,
and required a new recapitulation of the circumstances,
to the minutest and most trivial point, which attended each
part of the melancholy scene. No confusion or contradiction,
however, occurred, that could countenance the suspicion which
he seemed to have adopted against Butler. At length the train
of his interrogatories reached Madge Wildfire, at whose name
the magistrate and town-clerk exchanged significant glances.
If the fate of the Good Town had depended on her careful
magistrate's knowing the features and dress of this personage,
his inquiries could not have been more particular. But Butler
could say almost nothing of this person's features, which were
disguised apparently with red paint and soot, like an Indian
going to battle, besides the projecting shade of a curch, or coif,
which muffled the hair of the supposed female. He declared
that he thought he could not know this Madge Wildfire, if
placed before him in a different dress, but that he believed he
might recognise her voice.

  The magistrate requested him again to state by what gate he
left the city.

  ``By the Cowgate Port,'' replied Butler.

  ``Was that the nearest road to Libberton?''

  ``No,'' answered Butler, with embarrassment; ``but it was
the nearest way to extricate myself from the mob.''

  The clerk and magistrate again exchanged glances.

  ``Is the Cowgate Port a nearer way to Libberton from the
Grassmarket than Bristo Port?''

  ``No,'' replied Butler; ``but I had to visit a friend.''

  ``Indeed!'' said the interrogator---``You were in a hurry to
tell the sight you had witnessed, I suppose?''

  ``Indeed I was not,'' replied Butler; ``nor did I speak on
the subject the whole time I was at St. Leonard's Crags.''

  ``Which road did you take to St. Leonard's Crags?''

  ``By the foot of Salisbury Crags,'' was the reply.

  ``Indeed? you seem partial to circuitous routes,'' again said
the magistrate. ``Whom did you see after you left the city?''

  One by one he obtained a description of every one of the
groups who had passed Butler, as already noticed, their number,
demeanour, and appearance; and, at length, came to the circumstance
of the mysterious stranger in the King's Park. On
this subject Butler would fain have remained silent, But the
magistrate had no sooner got a slight hint concerning the
incident, than he seemed bent to possess himself of the most
minute particulars.

  ``Look ye, Mr. Butler,'' said he, ``you are a young man, and
bear an excellent character; so much I will myself testify in
your favour. But we are aware there has been, at times, a sort
of bastard and fiery zeal in some of your order, and those, men
irreproachable in other points, which has led them into doing
and countenancing great irregularities, by which the peace of
the country is liable to be shaken.---I will deal plainly with
you. I am not at all satisfied with this story, of your setting
out again and again to seek your dwelling by two several roads,
which were both circuitous. And, to be frank, no one whom
we have examined on this unhappy affair could trace in your
appearance any thing like your acting under compulsion. Moreover,
the waiters at the Cowgate Port observed something like
the trepidation of guilt in your conduct, and declare that you
were the first to command them to open the gate, in a tone of
authority, as if still presiding over the guards and out-posts of
the rabble, who had besieged them the whole night.''

  ``God forgive them!'' said Butler; ``I only asked free passage
for myself; they must have much misunderstood, if they did not
wilfully misrepresent me.''

  ``Well, Mr. Butler,'' resumed the magistrate, ``I am inclined
to judge the best and hope the best, as I am sure I wish the
best; but you must be frank with me, if you wish to secure my
good opinion, and lessen the risk of inconvenience to yourself.
You have allowed you saw another individual in your passage
through the King's Park to Saint Leonard's Crags---I must
know every word which passed betwixt you.''

  Thus closely pressed, Butler, who had no reason for concealing
what passed at that meeting, unless because Jeanie Deans
was concerned in it, thought it best to tell the whole truth from
beginning to end.

  ``Do you suppose,'' said the magistrate, pausing, ``that the
young woman will accept an invitation so mysterious?''

  ``I fear she will,'' replied Butler.

  ``Why do you use the word _fear_ it?'' said the magistrate.

  ``Because I am apprehensive for her safety, in meeting at
such a time and place, one who had something of the manner
of a desperado, and whose message was of a character so
inexplicable.''

  ``Her safety shall be cared for,'' said the magistrate. ``Mr.
Butler, I am concerned I cannot immediately discharge you
from confinement, but I hope you will not be long detained.---
Remove Mr. Butler, and let him be provided with decent
accommodation in all respects.''

  He was conducted back to the prison accordingly; but, in
the food offered to him, as well as in the apartment in which
he was lodged, the recommendation of the magistrate was
strictly attended to.
