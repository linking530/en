	Elswhair he colde right weel lay down the law,
	But in his house was meek as is a daw.
				Davie Lindsay.

  ``There has been Jock Driver the carrier here, speering about
his new graith,'' said Mrs. Saddletree to her husband, as he
crossed his threshold, not with the purpose, by any means, of
consulting him upon his own affairs, but merely to intimate, by
a gentle recapitulation, how much duty she had gone through in
his absence.

  ``Weel,'' replied Bartoline, and deigned not a word more.

  ``And the laird of Girdingburst has had his running footman
here, and ca'd himsell (he's a civil pleasant young gentleman),
to see when the broidered saddle-cloth for his sorrel horse will
be ready, for he wants it agane the Kelso races.''

  ``Weel, aweel,'' replied Bartoline, as laconically as before.

  ``And his lordship, the Earl of Blazonbury, Lord Flash and
Flame, is like to be clean daft, that the harness for the six
Flanders mears, wi' the crests, coronets, housings, and mountings
conform, are no sent hame according to promise gien.''

  ``Weel, weel, weel---weel, weel, gudewife,'' said Saddletree,
``if he gangs daft, we'll hae him cognosced---it's a' very weel.''

  ``It's weel that ye think sae, Mr. Saddletree,'' answered his
helpmate, rather nettled at the indifference with which her
report was received; ``there's mony ane wad hae thought themselves
affronted, if sae mony customers had ca'd and naebody to
answer them but women-folk; for a' the lads were aff, as soon
as your back was turned, to see Porteous hanged, that might be
counted upon; and sae, you no being at hame''------

  ``Houts, Mrs. Saddletree,'' said Bartoline, with an air of
consequence, ``dinna deave me wi' your nonsense; I was under
the necessity of being elsewhere---_non omnia_---as Mr. Crossmyloof
said, when he was called by two macers at once---_non omnia
possumus---pessimus---possimis_---I ken our law-latin offends Mr.
Butler's ears, but it means, Naebody, an it were the Lord President
himsell, can do twa turns at ance.''

  ``Very right, Mr. Saddletree,'' answered his careful helpmate,
with a sarcastic smile; ``and nae doubt it's a decent thing to
leave your wife to look after young gentlemen's saddles and
bridles, when ye gang to see a man, that never did ye nae ill,
raxing a halter.''

  ``Woman,'' said Saddletree, assuming an elevated tone, to
which the _meridian_ had somewhat contributed, ``desist,---I say
forbear, from intromitting with affairs thou canst not understand.
D'ye think I was born to sit here brogging an elshin through
bend-leather, when sic men as Duncan Forbes, and that other
Arniston chield there, without muckle greater parts, if the close-head
speak true, than mysell maun be presidents and king's
advocates, nae doubt, and wha but they? Whereas, were
favour equally distribute, as in the days of the wight Wallace''------

  ``I ken naething we wad hae gotten by the wight Wallace,''
said Mrs. Saddletree, ``unless, as I hae heard the auld folk tell,
they fought in thae days wi' bend-leather guns, and then it's a
chance but what, if he had bought them, he might have forgot
to pay for them. And as for the greatness of your parts, Bartley,
the folk in the close-head<*> maun ken mair about them than I

* [_Close-head,_ the entrance of a blind alley.]

do, if they make sic a report of them.''

  ``I tell ye, woman,'' said Saddletree, in high dudgeon, ``that
ye ken naething about these matters. In Sir William Wallace's
days there was nae man pinned down to sic a slavish wark as a
saddler's, for they got ony leather graith that they had use for
ready-made out of Holland.''

  ``Well,'' said Butler, who was, like many of his profession,
something of a humorist and dry joker, ``if that be the case,
Mr. Saddletree, I think we have changed for the better; since
we make our own harness, and only import our lawyers from
Holland.''

  ``It's ower true, Mr. Butler,'' answered Bartoline, with a
sigh; ``if I had had the luck---or rather, if my father had had
the sense to send me to Leyden and Utrecht to learn the Substitutes
and Pandex''------

  ``You mean the Institutes---Justinian's Institutes, Mr.
Saddletree?'' said Butler.

  ``Institutes and substitutes are synonymous words, Mr. Butler,
and used indifferently as such in deeds of tailzie, as you
may see in Balfour's Practiques, or Dallas of St. Martin's
Styles. I understand these things pretty weel, I thank God
but I own I should have studied in Holland.''

  ``To comfort you, you might not have been farther forward
than you are now, Mr. Saddletree,'' replied Mr. Butler; ``for
our Scottish advocates are an aristocratic race. Their brass is
of the right Corinthian quality, and _Non cuivis contigit adire
Corinthum_---Aha, Mr. Saddletree?''

  ``And aha, Mr. Butler,'' rejoined Bartoline, upon whom, as
may be well supposed, the jest was lost, and all but the sound
of the words, ``ye said a gliff syne it was _quivis,_ and now I
heard ye say _cuivis_ with my ain ears, as plain as ever I heard a
word at the fore-bar.''

  ``Give me your patience, Mr. Saddletree, and I'll explain the
discrepancy in three words,'' said Butler, as pedantic in his own
department, though with infinitely more judgment and learning,
as Bartoline was in his self-assumed profession of the law---
``Give me your patience for a moment---You'll grant that the
nominative case is that by which a person or thing is nominated
or designed, and which may be called the primary case, all
others being formed from it by alterations of the termination in
the learned languages, and by prepositions in our modern
Babylonian jargons---You'll grant me that, I suppose, Mr.
Saddletree?''

  ``I dinna ken whether I will or no---_ad avisandum,_ ye ken
---naebody should be in a hurry to make admissions, either in
point of law, or in point of fact,'' said Saddletree, looking, or
endeavouring to look, as if he understood what was said.

  ``And the dative case,'' continued Butler------

  ``I ken what a tutor dative is,'' said Saddletree, ``readily
enough.''

  ``The dative case,'' resumed the grammarian, ``is that in
which anything is given or assigned as properly belonging to a
person or thing---You cannot deny that, I am sure.''

  ``I am sure I'll no grant it, though,'' said Saddletree.

  ``Then, what the _deevil_ d'ye take the nominative and the
dative cases to be?'' said Butler, hastily, and surprised at once
out of his decency of expression and accuracy of pronunciation.

  ``I'll tell you that at leisure, Mr. Butler,'' said Saddletree,
with a very knowing look; ``I'll take a day to see and answer
every article of your condescendence, and then I'll hold you to
confess or deny as accords.''

  ``Come, come, Mr. Saddletree,'' said his wife, ``we'll hae nae
confessions and condescendences here; let them deal in thae
sort o' wares that are paid for them---they suit the like o' us as
all as a demipique saddle would suit a draught ox.''

  ``Aha!'' said Mr. Butler, ``_Optat ephippia bos piger,_ nothing
new under the sun---But it was a fair hit of Mrs. Saddletree,
however.''

  ``And it wad far better become ye, Mr. Saddletree,'' continued
his helpmate, ``since ye say ye hae skeel o' the law, to
try if ye can do onything for Effie Deans, puir thing, that's
lying up in the tolbooth yonder, cauld, and hungry, and comfortless---
A servant lass of ours, Mr. Butler, and as innocent a lass,
to my thinking, and as usefu' in the shop---When Mr. Saddletree
gangs out,---and ye're aware he's seldom at hame when
there's ony o' the plea-houses open,---poor Effie used to help me
to tumble the bundles o' barkened leather up and down, and
range out the gudes, and suit a' body's humours---And troth,
she could aye please the customers wi' her answers, for she was
aye civil, and a bonnier lass wasna in Auld Reekie. And
when folk were hasty and unreasonable, she could serve them
better than me, that am no sae young as I hae been, Mr. Butler,
and a wee bit short in the temper into the bargain. For when
there's ower mony folks crying on me at anes, and nane but ae
tongue to answer them, folk maun speak hastily, or they'll ne'er
get through their wark---Sae I miss Effie daily.''

  ``_De die in diem,_'' added Saddletree.

  ``I think,'' said Butler, after a good deal of hesitation, ``I
have seen the girl in the shop---a modest-looking, fair-haired
girl?''

  ``Ay, ay, that's just puir Effie,'' said her mistress. ``How she
was abandoned to hersell, or whether she was sackless o' the
sinful deed, God in Heaven knows; but if she's been guilty,
she's been sair tempted, and I wad amaist take my Bible-aith
she hasna been hersell at the time.''

  Butler had by this time become much agitated; he fidgeted
up and down the shop, and showed the greatest agitation that a
person of such strict decorum could be supposed to give way to.
``Was not this girl,'' he said, ``the daughter of David Deans,
that had the parks at St. Leonard's taken? and has she not a
sister?''

  ``In troth has she,---puir Jeanie Deans, ten years aulder than
hersell; she was here greeting a wee while syne about her tittie.
And what could I say to her, but that she behoved to come
and speak to Mr. Saddletree when he was at hame? It wasna
that I thought Mr. Saddletree could do her or ony ither body
muckle good or ill, but it wad aye serve to keep the puir
thing's heart up for a wee while; and let sorrow come when
sorrow maun.''

  ``Ye're mistaen though, gudewife,'' said Saddletree scornfully,
``for I could hae gien her great satisfaction; I could hae proved
to her that her sister was indicted upon the statute saxteen
hundred and ninety, chapter one---For the mair ready prevention
of child-murder---for concealing her pregnancy, and giving
no account of the child which she had borne.''

  ``I hope,'' said Butler,---``I trust in a gracious God, that she
can clear herself.''

  ``And sae do I, Mr. Butler,'' replied Mrs. Saddletree. ``I
am sure I wad hae answered for her as my ain daughter; but
wae's my heart, I had been tender a' the simmer, and scarce
ower the door o' my room for twal weeks. And as for Mr.
Saddletree, he might be in a lying-in hospital, and ne'er find
out what the women cam there for. Sae I could see little or
naething o' her, or I wad hae had the truth o' her situation out
o' her, I'se warrant ye---But we a' think her sister maun be able
to speak something to clear her.''

  ``The haill Parliament House,'' said Saddletree, ``was speaking
o' naething else, till this job o' Porteous's put it out o' head
---It's a beautiful point of presumptive murder, and there's
been nane like it in the Justiciar Court since the case of Luckie
Smith the howdie, that suffered in the year saxteen hundred
and seventy-nine.''

  ``But what's the matter wi' you, Mr. Butler?'' said the
good woman; ``ye are looking as white as a sheet; will ye tak
a dram?''

  ``By no means,'' said Butler, compelling himself to speak.
``I walked in from Dumfries yesterday, and this is a warm day.''

  ``Sit down,'' said Mrs. Saddletree, laying hands on him
kindly, ``and rest ye---yell kill yoursell, man, at that rate.---
And are we to wish you joy o' getting the scule, Mr. Butler?''

  ``Yes---no---I do not know,'' answered the young man
vaguely. But Mrs. Saddletree kept him to point, partly out
of real interest, partly from curiosity.

  ``Ye dinna ken whether ye are to get the free scule o' Dumfries
or no, after hinging on and teaching it a' the simmer?''

  ``No, Mrs. Saddletree---I am not to have it,'' replied Butler,
more collectedly. ``The Laird of Black-at-the-Bane had a
natural son bred to the kirk, that the Presbytery could not
be prevailed upon to license; and so''------

  ``Ay, ye need say nae mair about it; if there was a laird
that had a puir kinsman or a bastard that it wad suit, there's
enough said.---And ye're e'en come back to Liberton to wait
for dead men's shoon?---and for as frail as Mr. Whackbairn is,
he may live as lang as you, that are his assistant and successor.''

  ``Very like,'' replied Butler, with a sigh; ``I do not know if
I should wish it otherwise.''

  ``Nae doubt, it's a very vexing thing,'' continued the good
lady, ``to be in that dependent station; and you that hae
right and title to sae muckle better, I wonder how ye bear
these crosses.''

  ``_Quos diligit castigat,_'' answered Butler; ``even the pagan
Seneca could see an advantage in affliction, The Heathens
had their philosophy, and the Jews their revelation, Mrs.
Saddletree, and they endured their distresses in their day.
Christians have a better dispensation than either---but doubtless''------

  He stopped and sighed.

  ``I ken what ye mean,'' said Mrs. Saddletree, looking toward
her husband; ``there's whiles we lose patience in spite of baith
book and Bible---But ye are no gaun awa, and looking sae
poorly---ye'll stay and take some kale wi' us?''

  Mr. Saddletree laid aside Balfour's Practiques (his favourite
study, and much good may it do him), to join in his wife's
hospitable importunity. But the teacher declined all entreaty,
and took his leave upon the spot.

  ``There's something in a' this,'' said Mrs. Saddletree, looking
after him as he walked up the street; ``I wonder what makes
Mr. Butler sae distressed about Effie's misfortune---there was
nae acquaintance atween them that ever I saw or heard of;
but they were neighbours when David Deans was on the Laird
o' Dumbiedikes' land. Mr. Butler wad ken her father, or some
o' her folk.---Get up, Mr. Saddletree---ye have set yoursell
down on the very brecham that wants stitching---and here's
little Willie, the prentice.---Ye little rin-there-out deil that ye
are, what takes you raking through the gutters to see folk
hangit?---how wad ye like when it comes to be your ain
chance, as I winna ensure ye, if ye dinna mend your manners?---
And what are ye maundering and greeting for, as if a word
were breaking your banes?---Gang in by, and be a better bairn
another time, and tell Peggy to gie ye a bicker o' broth, for ye'll
be as gleg as a gled, I'se warrant ye.---It's a fatherless bairn,
Mr. Saddletree, and motherless, whilk in some cases may be
waur, and ane would take care o' him if they could---it's a
Christian duty.''

  ``Very true, gudewife,'' said Saddletree in reply, ``we are _in
loco parentis_ to him during his years of pupillarity, and I hae
had thoughts of applying to the Court for a commission as
factor _loco tutoris,_ seeing there is nae tutor nominate, and the
tutor-at-law declines to act; but only I fear the expense of the
procedure wad not be _in rem versam,_ for I am not aware if
Willie has ony effects whereof to assume the administration.''

  He concluded this sentence with a self-important cough, as
one who has laid down the law in an indisputable manner.

  ``Effects!'' said Mrs. Saddletree, ``what effects has the puir
wean?---he was in rags when his mother died; and the blue
polonie that Effie made for him out of an auld mantle of my
ain, was the first decent dress the bairn ever had on. Poor
Effie! can ye tell me now really, wi' a' your law, will her life
be in danger, Mr. Saddletree, when they arena able to prove
that ever there was a bairn ava?''

  ``Whoy,'' said Mr. Saddletree, delighted at having for once
in his life seen his wife's attention arrested by a topic of legal
discussion---``Whoy, there are two sorts of _murdrum_ or _murdragium,_
or what you _populariter et vulgariser_ call murther. I mean
there are many sorts; for there's your _murthrum per vigilias et
insidias,_ and your _murthrum_ under trust.''

  ``I am sure,'' replied his moiety, ``that murther by trust is
the way that the gentry murther us merchants, and whiles make
us shut the booth up---but that has naething to do wi' Effie's
misfortune.''

  ``The case of Effie (or Euphemia) Deans,'' resumed Saddletree,
``is one of those cases of murder presumptive, that is, a
murder of the law's inferring or construction, being derived
from certain _indicia_ or grounds of suspicion.''

  ``So that,'' said the good woman, ``unless poor Effie has
communicated her situation, she'll be hanged by the neck, if the
bairn was still-born, or if it be alive at this moment?''

  ``Assuredly,'' said Saddletree, ``it being a statute made by
our Sovereign Lord and Lady, to prevent the horrid delict of
bringing forth children in secret---The crime is rather a
favourite of the law, this species of murther being one of
its ain creation.''

  ``Then, if the law makes murders,'' said Mrs. Saddletree,
``the law should be hanged for them; or if they wad hang a
lawyer instead, the country wad find nae faut.''

  A summons to their frugal dinner interrupted the farther
progress of the conversation, which was otherwise like to take
a turn much less favourable to the science of jurisprudence and
its professors, than Mr. Bartoline Saddletree, the fond admirer
of both, had at its opening anticipated.
