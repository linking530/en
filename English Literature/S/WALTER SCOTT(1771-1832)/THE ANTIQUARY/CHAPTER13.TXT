	------The time was that I hated thee,
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love.
	Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
	I will endure ------
	But do not look for further recompense.
					As You Like It.

  Miss Isabella Wardour's complexion was considerably
heightened, when, after the delay necessary to arrange her
ideas, she presented herself in the drawing-room.

  ``I am glad you are come, my fair foe,'' said the Antiquary
greeting her with much kindness, ``for I have had a most
refractory, or at least negligent auditor, in my young friend
here, while I endeavoured to make him acquainted with the
history of Knockwinnock Castle. I think the danger of last
night has mazed the poor lad. But you, Miss Isabel,---why,
yon look as if flying through the night air had been your
natural and most congenial occupation; your colour is even
better than when you honoured my _hospitium_ yesterday. And
Sir Arthur---how fares my good old friend?''

  ``Indifferently well, Mr. Oldbuck; but I am afraid, not quite
able to receive your congratulations, or to pay---to pay---Mr. 
Lovel his thanks for his unparalleled exertions.''

  ``I dare say not---A good down pillow for his good white
head were more meet than a couch so churlish as Bessy's-apron,
plague on her!''

  ``I had no thought of intruding,'' said Lovel, looking upon the
ground, and speaking with hesitation and suppressed emotion;
``I did not---did not mean to intrude upon Sir Arthur or
Miss Wardour the presence of one who---who must necessarily
be unwelcome---as associated, I mean, with painful reflections.''

  ``Do not think my father so unjust and ungrateful,'' said
Miss Wardour. ``I dare say,'' she continued, participating in
Lovel's embarrassment---``I dare say---I am certain---that my
father would be happy to show his gratitude---in any way---
that is, which Mr. Lovel could consider it as proper to point
out.''

  ``Why the deuce,'' interrupted Oldbuck, ``what sort of a
qualification is that?---On my word, it reminds me of our
minister, who, choosing, like a formal old fop as he is, to drink
to my sister's inclinations, thought it necessary to add the saving
clause, Provided, madam, they be virtuous. Come, let us
have no more of this nonsense---I dare say Sir Arthur will bid
us welcome on some future day. And what news from the
kingdom of subterranean darkness and airy hope?---What says
the swart spirit of the mine? Has Sir Arthur had any good
intelligence of his adventure lately in Glen-Withershins?''

  Miss Wardour shook her head---``But indifferent, I fear, Mr.
Oldbuck; but there lie some specimens which have lately been
sent down.''

  ``Ah! my poor dear hundred pounds, which Sir Arthur
persuaded me to give for a share in that hopeful scheme, would
have bought a porter's load of mineralogy---But let me see
them.''

  And so saying, he sat down at the table in the recess, on
which the mineral productions were lying, and proceeded to
examine them, grumbling and pshawing at each which he took
up and laid aside.

  In the meantime, Lovel, forced as it were by this secession of
Oldbuck, into a sort of t<e^>te-<a'>-t<e^>te with Miss Wardour, took an
opportunity of addressing her in a low and interrupted tone of
voice. ``I trust Miss Wardour will impute, to circumstances
almost irresistible, this intrusion of a person who has reason to
think himself---so unacceptable a visitor.''

  ``Mr. Lovel,'' answered Miss Wardour, observing the same
tone of caution, ``I trust you will not---I am sure you are
incapable of abusing the advantages given to you by the services
you have rendered us, which, as they affect my father, can never
be sufficiently acknowledged or repaid. Could Mr. Lovel see
me without his own peace being affected---could he see me
as a friend---as a sister---no man will be---and, from all I
have ever heard of Mr. Lovel, ought to be, more welcome
but''------

  Oldbuck's anathema against the preposition _but_ was internally
echoed by Lovel. ``Forgive me if I interrupt you, Miss Wardour;
you need not fear my intruding upon a subject where I
have been already severely repressed;---but do not add to the
severity of repelling my sentiments the rigour of obliging me
to disavow them.''

  ``I am much embarrassed, Mr. Lovel,'' replied the young lady,
``by your---I would not willingly use a strong word---your
romantic and hopeless pertinacity. It is for yourself I plead,
that you would consider the calls which your country has upon
your talents---that you will not waste, in an idle and fanciful
indulgence of an ill-placed predilection, time, which, well
redeemed by active exertion, should lay the foundation of future
distinction. Let me entreat that you would form a manly
resolution''------

  ``It is enough, Miss Wardour;---I see plainly that''------

  ``Mr. Lovel, you are hurt---and, believe me, I sympathize in
the pain which I inflict; but can I, in justice to myself, in
fairness to you, do otherwise? Without my father's consent, I
never will entertain the addresses of any one, and how totally
impossible it is that he should countenance the partiality with
which you honour me, you are yourself fully aware; and,
indeed''------

  ``No, Miss Wardour,'' answered Lovel, in a tone of passionate
entreaty; ``do not go farther---is it not enough to crush every
hope in our present relative situation?---do not carry your
resolutions farther---why urge what would be your conduct if
Sir Arthur's objections could be removed?''

  ``It is indeed vain, Mr. Lovel,'' said Miss Wardour, ``because
their removal is impossible; and I only wish, as your friend,
and as one who is obliged to you for her own and her father's
life, to entreat you to suppress this unfortunate attachment---
to leave a country which affords no scope for your talents, and
to resume the honourable line of the profession which you seem
to have abandoned.''

  ``Well, Miss Wardour, your wishes shall be obeyed;---have
patience with me one little month, and if, in the course of
that space, I cannot show you such reasons for continuing my
residence at Fairport, as even you shall approve of, I will bid
adieu to its vicinity, and, with the same breath, to all my hopes
of happiness.''

  ``Not so, Mr. Lovel; many years of deserved happiness,
founded on a more rational basis than your present wishes, are,
I trust, before, you. But it is full time, to finish this conversation.
I cannot force you to adopt my advice---I cannot shut
the door of my father's house against the preserver of his life
and mine; but the sooner Mr. Lovel can teach his mind to
submit to the inevitable disappointment of wishes which have
been so rashly formed, the more highly be will rise in my esteem
---and, in the meanwhile, for his sake as well as mine, he must
excuse my putting an interdict upon conversation on a subject
so painful.''

  A servant at this moment announced that Sir Arthur desired
to speak to Mr. Oldbuck in his dressing-room.

  ``Let me show you the way,'' said Miss Wardour, who apparently
dreaded a continuation of her t<e^>te-<a`>-t<e^>te with Lovel,
and she conducted the Antiquary accordingly to her father's
apartment.

  Sir Arthur, his legs swathed in flannel, was stretched on the
couch. ``Welcome, Mr. Oldbuck,'' he said; ``I trust you have
come better off than I have done from the inclemency of yesterday
evening?''

  ``Truly, Sir Arthur, I was not so much exposed to it---I kept
_terra firma_---you fairly committed yourself to the cold night-air
in the most literal of all senses. But such adventures become
a gallant knight better than a humble esquire,---to rise on the
wings of the night-wind---to dive into the bowels of the earth. 
What news from our subterranean Good Hope!---the _terra
incognita_ of Glen-Withershins?''

  ``Nothing good as yet,'' said the Baronet, turning himself
hastily, as if stung by a pang of the gout; ``but Dousterswivel
does not despair.''

  ``Does he not?'' quoth Oldbuck; ``I do though, under his
favour. Why, old Dr. H------n<*> told me, when I was in

* Probably Dr. Hutton, the celebrated geologist.

Edinburgh, that we should never find copper enough, judging
from the specimens I showed him, to make a pair of sixpenny
knee-buckles---and I cannot see that those samples on the table
below differ much in quality.''

  ``The learned doctor is not infallible, I presume?''

  ``No; but he is one of our first chemists; and this tramping
philosopher of yours---this Dousterswivel---is, I have a notion, one,
of those learned adventurers described by Kirchner, _Artem habent
sine arte, partem sine parte, quorum medium est mentiri, vita
eorum mendicatum ire;_ that is to say, Miss Wardour''------

  ``It is unnecessary to translate,'' said Miss Wardour---``I
comprehend your general meaning; but I hope Mr. Dousterswivel
will turn out a more trustworthy character.''

  ``I doubt it not a little,'' said the Antiquary,---``and we are
a foul way out if we cannot discover this infernal vein that he
has prophesied about these two years.''

  ``_You_ have no great interest in the matter, Mr. Oldbuck,''
said the Baronet.

  ``Too much, too much, Sir Arthur; and yet, for the sake of
my fair foe here, I would consent to lose it all so you had no
more on the venture.''

  There was a painful silence of a few moments, for Sir Arthur
was too proud to acknowledge the downfall of his golden dreams,
though he could no longer disguise to himself that such was
likely to be the termination of the adventure. ``I understand,''
he at length said, ``that the young gentleman, to whose gallantry
and presence of mind we were so much indebted last
night, has favoured me with a visit---I am distressed that I am
unable to see him, or indeed any one, but an old friend like you,
Mr. Oldbuck.''

  A declination of the Antiquary's stiff backbone acknowledged
the preference.

  ``You made acquaintance with this young gentleman in
Edinburgh, I suppose?''

  Oldbuck told the circumstances of their becoming known to
each other.

  ``Why, then, my daughter is an older acquaintance, of Mr.
Lovel than you are,'' said the Baronet.

  ``Indeed! I was not aware of that,'' answered Oldbuck somewhat
surprised.

  ``I met Mr. Lovel,'' said Isabella, slightly colouring, ``when
I resided this last spring with my aunt, Mrs. Wilmot.''

  ``In Yorkshire?---and what character did he bear then, or
how was he engaged?'' said Oldbuck,---``and why did not you
recognise him when I introduced you?''

  Isabella answered the least difficult question, and passed over
the other---``He had a commission in the army, and had, I
believe, served with reputation; he was much respected, as an
amiable and promising young man.''

  ``And pray, such being the case,'' replied the Antiquary, not
disposed to take one reply in answer to two distinct questions,
``why did you not speak to the lad at once when you met him
at my house? I thought you had less of the paltry pride of
womankind about you, Miss Wardour.''

  ``There was a reason for it,'' said Sir Arthur with dignity;
``you know the opinions---prejudices, perhaps you will call them
---of our house concerning purity of birth. This young gentleman
is, it seems, the illegitimate son of a man of fortune; my
daughter did not choose to renew their acquaintance till she
should know whether I approved of her holding any intercourse
with him.''

  ``If it had been with his mother instead of himself,'' answered
Oldbuck, with his usual dry causticity of humour, ``I could see
an excellent reason for it. Ah, poor lad! that was the cause,
then, that he seemed so absent and confused while I explained
to him the reason of the bend of bastardy upon the shield
yonder under the corner turret!''

  ``True,'' said the Baronet, with complacency---``it is the
shield of Malcolm the Usurper, as he is called. The tower
which he built is termed, after him, Malcolm's Tower, but more
frequently Misticot's Tower, which I conceive to be a corruption
for _Misbegot._ He is denominated, in the Latin pedigree of our
family, _Milcolumbus Nothus;_ and his temporary seizure of our
property, and most unjust attempt to establish his own illegitimate
line in the estate of Knockwinnock, gave rise to such
family feuds and misfortunes, as strongly to found us in that
horror and antipathy to defiled blood and illegitimacy which has
been handed down to me from my respected ancestry.''

  ``I know the story,'' said Oldbuck, ``and I was telling it to
Lovel this moment, with some of the wise maxims and consequences
which it has engrafted on your family politics. Poor
fellow! he must have been much hurt: I took the wavering of
his attention for negligence, and was something piqued at it,
and it proves to be only an excess of feeling. I hope, Sir
Arthur, you will not think the less of your life because it has
been preserved by such assistance?''

  ``Nor the less of my assistant either,'' said the Baronet;
``my doors and table shall be equally open to him as if he had
descended of the most unblemished lineage.''

  ``Come, I am glad of that---he'll know where he can get a
dinner, then, if he wants one. But what views can he have in
this neighbourhood? I must catechise him; and if I find he
wants it---or, indeed, whether he does or not---he shall have my
best advice.'' As the Antiquary made this liberal promise, he
took his leave of Miss Wardour and her father, eager to commence
operations upon Mr. Lovel. He informed him abruptly
that Miss Wardour sent her compliments, and remained in
attendance on her father, and then, taking him by the arm, he
led him out of the castle.

  Knockwinnock still preserved much of the external attributes
of a baronial castle. It had its drawbridge, though now never
drawn up, and its dry moat, the sides of which had been planted
with shrubs, chiefly of the evergreen tribes. Above these rose
the old building, partly from a foundation of red rock scarped
down to the sea-beach, and partly from the steep green verge
of the moat. The trees of the avenue have been already
mentioned, and many others rose around of large size,---as if to
confute the prejudice that timber cannot be raised near to the
ocean. Our walkers paused, and looked back upon the castle,
as they attained the height of a small knoll, over which lay
their homeward road; for it is to be supposed they did not
tempt the risk of the tide by returning along the sands. The
building flung its broad shadow upon the tufted foliage of the
shrubs beneath it, while the front windows sparkled in the sun. 
They were viewed by the gazers with very different feelings. 
Lovel, with the fond eagerness of that passion which derives its
food and nourishment from trifles, as the chameleon is said to
live on the air, or upon the invisible insects which it contains,
endeavoured to conjecture which of the numerous windows
belonged to the apartment now graced by Miss Wardour's
presence. The speculations of the Antiquary were of a more
melancholy cast, and were partly indicated by the ejaculation
of _cito peritura!_ as he turned away from the prospect. Lovel,
roused from his reverie, looked at him as if to inquire the
meaning of an exclamation so ominous. The old man shook
his head. ``Yes, my young friend,'' said he, ``I doubt greatly
---and it wrings my heart to say it---this ancient family is
going fast to the ground!''

  ``Indeed!'' answered Lovel---``you surprise me greatly.''

  ``We harden ourselves in vain,'' continued the Antiquary,
pursuing his own train of thought and feeling---``we harden
ourselves in vain to treat with the indifference they deserve, the
changes of this trumpery whirligig world. We strive ineffectually
to be the self-sufficing invulnerable being, the _teres atque
rotundus_ of the poet;---the stoical exemption which philosophy
affects to give us over the pains and vexations of human life,
is as imaginary as the state of mystical quietism and perfection
aimed at by some crazy enthusiasts.''

  ``And Heaven forbid that it should be otherwise!'' said
Lovel, warmly---``Heaven forbid that any process of philosophy
were capable so to sear and indurate our feelings, that
nothing should agitate them but what arose instantly and
immediately out of our own selfish interests! I would as soon
wish my hand to be as callous as horn, that it might escape
an occasional cut or scratch, as I would be ambitious of the
stoicism which should render my heart like a piece of the
nether millstone.''

  The Antiquary regarded his youthful companion with a look
half of pity, half of sympathy, and shrugged up his shoulders
as he replied---``Wait, young man---wait till your bark has
been battered by the storm of sixty years of mortal vicissitude:
you will learn by that time, to reef your sails, that she may
obey the helm;---or, in the language of this world, you will
find distresses enough, endured and to endure, to keep your
feelings and sympathies in full exercise, without concerning
yourself more in the fate of others than you cannot possibly
avoid.''

  ``Well, Mr. Oldbuck, it may be so;---but as yet I resemble
you more in your practice than in your theory, for I cannot
help being deeply interested in the fate of the family we have
just left.''

  ``And well you may,'' replied Oldbuck. ``Sir Arthur's embarrassments
have of late become so many and so pressing,
that I am surprised you have not heard of them. And then
his absurd and expensive operations carried on by this High-German
landlouper, Dousterswivel''------

  ``I think I have seen that person, when, by some rare
chance, I happened to be in the coffee-room at Fairport;---a tall,
beetle-browed, awkward-built man, who entered upon scientific
subjects, as it appeared to my ignorance at least, with more
assurance than knowledge---was very arbitrary in laying down
and asserting his opinions, and mixed the terms of science with
a strange jargon of mysticism. A simple youth whispered me
that he was an _Illumin<e'>,_ and carried on an intercourse with the
invisible world.''

  ``O, the same---the same. He has enough of practical
knowledge to speak scholarly and wisely to those of whose intelligence
he stands in awe; and, to say the truth, this faculty,
joined to his matchless impudence, imposed upon me for some
time when I first knew him. But I have since understood, that
when he is among fools and womankind, he exhibits himself as
a perfect charlatan---talks of the _magisterium_---of sympathies
and antipathies---of the cabala---of the divining-rod---and all
the trumpery with which the Rosicrucians cheated a darker
age, and which, to our eternal disgrace, has in some degree
revived in our own. My friend Heavysterne know this fellow
abroad, and unintentionally (for he, you must know, is, God
bless the mark! a sort of believer) let me into a good deal of
his real character. Ah! were I caliph for a day, as Honest
Abon Hassan wished to be, I would scourge me these jugglers
out of the commonwealth with rods of scorpions. They
debauch the spirit of the ignorant and credulous with mystical
trash, as effectually as if they had besotted their brains with
gin, and then pick their pockets with the same facility. And
now has this strolling blackguard and mountebank put the
finishing blow to the ruin of an ancient and honourable family!''

  ``But how could he impose upon Sir Arthur to any ruinous
extent?''

  ``Why, I don't know. Sir Arthur is a good honourable
gentleman; but, as you may see from his loose ideas concerning
the Pikish language, he is by no means very strong in the
understanding. His estate is strictly entailed, and he has been
always an embarrassed man. This rapparee promised him
mountains of wealth, and an English company was found to
advance large sums of money---I fear on Sir Arthur's guarantee. 
Some gentlemen---I was ass enough to be one---took small
shares in the concern, and Sir Arthur himself made great outlay;
we were trained on by specious appearances and more
specious lies; and now, like John Bunyan, we awake, and
behold it is a dream!''

  ``I am surprised that you, Mr. Oldbuck, should have encouraged
Sir Arthur by your example.''

  ``Why,'' said Oldbuck, dropping his large grizzled eyebrow,
``I am something surprised and ashamed at it myself; it was
not the lucre of gain---nobody cares less for money (to be a
prudent man) than I do---but I thought I might risk this small
sum. It will be expected (though I am sure I cannot see
why) that I should give something to any one who will be kind
enough to rid me of that slip of womankind, my niece, Mary
M`Intyre; and perhaps it may be thought I should do something
to get that jackanapes, her brother, on in the army. In either
case, to treble my venture, would have helped me out. And
besides, I had some idea that the Ph<oe>nicians had in former
times wrought copper in that very spot. That cunning scoundrel,
Dousterswivel, found out my blunt side, and brought strange
tales (d---n him) of appearances of old shafts, and vestiges of
mining operations, conducted in a manner quite different from
those of modern times; and I---in short, I was a fool, and there
is an end. My loss is not much worth speaking about; but
Sir Arthur's engagements are, I understand, very deep, and my
heart aches for him) and the poor young lady who must share
his distress.''

  Here the conversation paused, until renewed in the next
chapter.
