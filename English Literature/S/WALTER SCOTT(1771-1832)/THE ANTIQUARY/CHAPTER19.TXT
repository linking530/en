	Here has been such a stormy encounter
	Betwixt my cousin Captain, and this soldier,
	About I know not what!---nothing, indeed;
	Competitions, degrees, and comparatives
	Of soldiership!-----
					 A Faire Qurrell.

  The attentive audience gave the fair transcriber of the foregoing
legend the thanks which politeness required. Oldbuck alone
curled up his nose, and observed, that Miss Wardour's skill was
something like that of the alchemists, for she had contrived to
extract a sound and valuable moral out of a very trumpery and
ridiculous legend. ``It is the fashion, as I am given to understand,
to admire those extravagant fictions---for me,

	------------I bear an English heart,
	Unused at ghosts and rattling bones to start.''

  ``Under your favour, my goot Mr. Oldenbuck,'' said the
German, ``Miss Wardour has turned de story, as she does every
thing as she touches, very pretty indeed; but all the history of
de Harz goblin, and how he walks among de desolate mountains
wid a great fir-tree for his walking cane, and wid de great green
bush around his head and his waist---that is as true as I am
an honest man.''

  ``There is no disputing any proposition so well guaranteed,''
answered the Antiquary, drily. But at this moment the approach
of a stranger cut short the conversation.

  The new comer was a handsome young man, about five-and-twenty,
in a military undress, and bearing, in his look and
manner, a good deal of the, martial profession---nay, perhaps a
little more than is quite consistent with the ease of a man of
perfect good-breeding, in whom no professional habit ought to
predominate. He was at once greeted by the greater part of
the company. ``My dear Hector!'' said Miss M`Intyre, as she
rose to take his hand---

  ``Hector, son of Priam, whence comest thou?'' said the
Antiquary.

  ``From Fife, my liege,'' answered the young soldier, and
continued, when he had politely saluted the rest of the company,
and particularly Sir Arthur and his daughter---``I learned from
one of the servants, as I rode towards Monkbarns to pay my
respects to you, that I should find the present company in this
place, and I willingly embrace the opportunity to pay my respects
to so many of my friends at once.''

  ``And to a new one also, my trusty Trojan,'' said Oldbuck. 
``Mr. Lovel, this is my nephew, Captain M`Intyre---Hector, I
recommend Mr. Lovel to your acquaintance.''

  The young soldier fixed his keen eye upon Lovel, and paid
his compliment with more reserve than cordiality and as our
acquaintance thought his coldness almost supercilious, he was
equally frigid and haughty in making the necessary return to
it; and thus a prejudice seemed to arise between them at the
very commencement of their acquaintance.

  The observations which Lovel made during the remainder
of this pleasure party did not tend to reconcile him with this
addition to their society. Captain M`Intyre, with the gallantry
to be expected from his age and profession, attached himself to
the service of Miss Wardour, and offered her, on every possible
opportunity, those marks of attention which Lovel would have
given the world to have rendered, and was only deterred from
offering by the fear of her displeasure. With forlorn dejection
at one moment, and with irritated susceptibility at another, he
saw this handsome young soldier assume and exercise all the
privileges of a _cavaliere servente._ He handed Miss Wardour's
gloves, he assisted her in putting on her shawl, he attached
himself to her in the walks, had a hand ready to remove every
impediment in her path, and an arm to support her where it
was rugged or difficult; his conversation was addressed chiefly
to her, and, where circumstances permitted, it was exclusively
so. All this, Lovel well knew, might be only that sort of
egotistical gallantry which induces some young men of the
present day to give themselves the air of engrossing the
attention of the prettiest women in company, as if the others
were unworthy of their notice. But he thought he observed in
the conduct of Captain M`Intyre something of marked and
peculiar tenderness, which was calculated to alarm the jealousy
of a lover. Miss Wardour also received his attentions; and
although his candour allowed they were of a kind which could
not be repelled without some strain of affectation, yet it galled
him to the heart to witness that she did so.

  The heart-burning which these reflections occasioned proved
very indifferent seasoning to the dry antiquarian discussions
with which Oldbuck, who continued to demand his particular
attention, was unremittingly persecuting him; and he underwent,
with fits of impatience that amounted almost to loathing,
a course of lectures upon monastic architecture, in all its styles,
from the massive Saxon to the florid Gothic, and from that to
the mixed and composite architecture of James the First's time,
when, according to Oldbuck, all orders were confounded, and
columns of various descriptions arose side by side, or were piled
above each other, as if symmetry had been forgotten, and the
elemental principles of art resolved into their primitive confusion.
``What can be more cutting to the heart than the
sight of evils,'' said Oldbuck, in rapturous enthusiasm, ``which
we are compelled to behold, while we do not possess the power
of remedying them?'' Lovel answered by an involulatary groan. 
``I see, my dear young friend, and most congenial spirit, that
you feel these enormities almost as much as I do. Have you
ever approached them, or met them, without longing to tear, to
deface, what is so dishonourable?''

  ``Dishonourable!'' echoed Lovel---``in what respect dishonourable?''

  ``I mean, disgraceful to the arts.''

  ``Where? how?''

  ``Upon the portico, for example, of the schools of Oxford,
where, at immense expense, the barbarous, fantastic, and ignorant
architect has chosen to represent the whole five orders of
architecture on the front of one building.''

  By such attacks as these, Oldbuck, unconscious of the torture
he was giving, compelled Lovel to give him a share of his attention,
---as a skilful angler, by means of his line, maintains an
influence over the most frantic movements of his agonized prey.

  They were now on their return to the spot where they had
left the carriages; and it is inconceivable how often, in the
course of that short walk, Lovel, exhausted by the unceasing
prosing of his worthy companion, mentally bestowed on the
devil, or any one else that would have rid him of hearing more
of them, all the orders and disorders of architecture which had
been invented or combined from the building of Solomon's
temple downwards. A slight incident occurred, however, which
sprinkled a little patience on the heat of his distemperature.

  Miss Wardour, and her self-elected knight companion, rather
preceded the others in the narrow path, when the young lady
apparently became desirous to unite herself with the rest of
the party, and, to break off her _t<e^>te-<a`>-t<e^>te_ with the young officer,
fairly made a pause until Mr. Oldbuck came up. ``I wished to
ask you a question, Mr. Oldbuck, concerning the date of these
interesting ruins.''

  It would be doing injustice to Miss Wardour's _savoir faire,_
to suppose she was not aware that such a question would lead
to an answer of no limited length. The Antiquary, starting
like a war-horse at the trumpet sound, plunged at once into the
various arguments for and against the date of 1273, which had
been assigned to the priory of St. Ruth by a late publication on
Scottish architectural antiquities. He raked up the names of
all the priors who had ruled the institution, of the nobles who
had bestowed lands upon it, and of the monarchs who had slept
their last sleep among its roofless courts. As a train which
takes fire is sure to light another, if there be such in the
vicinity, the Baronet, catching at the name of one of his
ancestors which occurred in Oldbuck's disquisition, entered
upon an account of his wars, his conquests, and his trophies;
and worthy Dr. Blattergowl was induced, from the mention of
a grant of lands, _cum decimis inclusis tam vicariis quam
garbalibus, et nunquan antea separatis,_ to enter into a long
explanation concerning the interpretation given by the Teind
Court in the consideration of such a clause, which had occurred
in a process for localling his last augmentation of stipend. 
The orators, like three racers, each pressed forward to the goal,
without much regarding how each crossed and jostled his
competitors. Mr. Oldbuck harangued, the Baronet declaimed,
Mr. Blattergowl prosed and laid down the law, while the Latin
forms of feudal grants were mingled with the jargon of blazonry,
and the yet more barbarous phraseology of the Teind Court
of Scotland. ``He was,'' exclaimed Oldbuck, speaking of the
Prior Adhemar, ``indeed an exemplary prelate; and, from his
strictness of morals, rigid execution of penance, joined to the
charitable disposition of his mind, and the infirmities endured
by his great age and ascetic habits''------

  Here he chanced to cough, and Sir Arthur burst in, or rather
continued---``was called popularly Hell-in-Harness; he carried
a shield, gules with a sable fess, which we have since disused,
and was slain at the battle of Vernoil, in France, after killing
six of the English with his own''------

  ``Decreet of certification,'' proceeded the clergyman, in that
prolonged, steady, prosing tone, which, however overpowered at
first by the vehemence of competition, promised, in the long
run, to obtain the ascendancy in this strife of narrators;---
``Decreet of certification having gone out, and parties being
held as confessed, the proof seemed to be held as concluded,
when their lawyer moved to have it opened up, on the allegation
that they had witnesses to bring forward, that they had been
in the habit of carrying the ewes to lamb on the teind-free land;
which was a mere evasion, for''------

  But here the, Baronet and Mr. Oldbuck having recovered
their wind, and continued their respective harangues, the three
_strands_ of the conversation, to speak the language of a rope-work,
were again twined together into one undistinguishable
string of confusion.

  Yet, howsoever uninteresting this piebald jargon might seem,
it was obviously Miss Wardour's purpose to give it her attention,
in preference to yielding Captain M`Intyre an opportunity of
renewing their private conversation. So that, after waiting for
a little time with displeasure, ill concealed by his haughty
features, he left her to enjoy her bad taste, and taking his
sister by the arm, detained her a little behind the rest of the
party.

  ``So I find, Mary, that your neighbour has neither become
more lively nor less learned during my absence.''

  ``We lacked your patience and wisdom to instruct us,
Hector.''

  ``Thank you, my dear sister. But you have got a wiser, if
not so lively an addition to your society, than your unworthy
brother---Pray, who is this Mr. Lovel, whom our old uncle has
at once placed so high in his good graces?---he does not use to
be so accessible to strangers.''

  ``Mr. Lovel, Hector, is a very gentleman-like young man.''

  ``Ay,---that is to say, he bows when he comes into a room,
and wears a coat that is whole at the elbows.''

  ``No, brother; it says a great deal more. It says that his
manners and discourse express the feelings and education of the
higher class.''

  ``But I desire to know what is his birth and his rank in
society, and what is his title to be in the circle in which I find
him domesticated?''

  ``If you mean, how he comes to visit at Monkbarns, you must
ask my uncle, who will probably reply, that he invites to his
own house such company as he pleases; and if you mean to
ask Sir Arthur, you must know that Mr. Lovel rendered Miss
Wardour and him a service of the most important kind.''

  ``What! that romantic story is true, then?---And pray, does
the valorous knight aspire, as is befitting on such occasions, to
the hand of the young lady whom he redeemed from peril? It
is quite in the rule of romance, I am aware; and I did think
that she was uncommonly dry to me as we walked together, and
seemed from time to time as if she watched whether she was
not giving offence to her gallant cavalier.''

  ``Dear Hector,'' said his sister, ``if you really continue to
nourish any affection for Miss Wardour''------

  ``If, Mary?---what an _if_ was there!''

  ``------I own I consider your perseverance as hopeless.''

  ``And why hopeless, my sage sister?'' asked Captain M`Intyre:
``Miss Wardour, in the state of her father's affairs, cannot pretend
to much fortune;---and, as to family, I trust that of
M`lntyre is not inferior.''

  ``But, Hector,'' continued his sister, ``Sir Arthur always considers
us as members of the Monkbarns family.''

  ``Sir Arthur may consider what he pleases,'' answered the
Highlander scornfully; ``but any one with common sense will
consider that the wife takes rank from the husband, and that
my father's pedigree of fifteen unblemished descents must have
ennobled my mother, if her veins had been filled with printer's
ink.''

  ``For God's sake, Hector,'' replied his anxious sister, ``take
care of yourself! a single expression of that kind, repeated to
my uncle by an indiscreet or interested eavesdropper, would lose
you his favour for ever, and destroy all chance of your succeeding
to his estate.''

  ``Be it so,'' answered the heedless young man; ``I am one
of a profession which the world has never been able to do
without, and will far less endure to want for half a century to
come; and my good old uncle may tack his good estate and his
plebeian name to your apron-string if he pleases, Mary, and you
may wed this new favourite of his if you please, and you may
both of you live quiet, peaceable, well-regulated lives, if it
pleases Heaven. My part is taken---I'll fawn on no man for
an inheritance which should be mine by birth.''

  Miss M`Intyre laid her hand on her brother's arm, and
entreated him to suppress his vehemence. ``Who,'' she said,
``injures or seeks to injure you, but your own hasty temper?---
what dangers are you defying, but those you have yourself conjured
up?---Our uncle has hitherto been all that is kind and
paternal in his conduct to us, and why should you suppose he
will in future be otherwise than what he has ever been, since
we were left as orphans to his care?''

  ``He is an excellent old gentleman, I must own,'' replied
M`Intyre, ``and I am enraged at myself when I chance to
offend him; but then his eternal harangues upon topics not
worth the spark of a flint---his investigations about invalided
pots and pans and tobacco-stoppers past service---all these things
put me out of patience. I have something of Hotspur in me,
sister, I must confess.''

  ``Too much, too much, my dear brother! Into how many
risks, and, forgive me for saying, some of them little creditable,
has this absolute and violent temper led you! Do not let such
clouds darken the time you are now to pass in our neighbourhood,
but let our old benefactor see his kinsman as he is---
generous, kind, and lively, without being rude, headstrong, and
impetuous.''

  ``Well,'' answered Captain M`Intyre, ``I am schooled---good-manners
be my speed! I'll do the civil thing by your new
friend---I'll have some talk with this Mr. Lovel.''

  With this determination, in which he was for the time perfectly
sincere, he joined the party who were walking before them. 
The treble disquisition was by this time ended; and Sir Arthur
was speaking on the subject of foreign news, and the political
and military situation of the country, themes upon which every
man thinks himself qualified to give an opinion. An action
of the preceding year having come upon the _tapis,_ Lovel,
accidentally mingling in the conversation, made some assertion
concerning it, of the accuracy of which Captain M`Intyre
seemed not to be convinced, although his doubts were politely
expressed.

  ``You must confess yourself in the wrong here, Hector,'' said
his uncle, ``although I know no man less willing to give up an
argument; but you were in England at the time, and Mr. Lovel
was probably concerned in the affair.''

  ``I am speaking to a military man, then?'' said M`Intyre;
``may I inquire to what regiment Mr. Lovel belongs?''---Mr. 
Lovel gave him the number of the regiment. ``It happens
strangely that we should never have met before, Mr. Lovel. I
know your regiment very well, and have served along with them
at different times.''

  A blush crossed Lovel's countenance. ``I have not lately
been with my regiment,'' he replied; ``I served the last
campaign upon the staff of General Sir ------ ------.''

  ``Indeed! that is more wonderful than the other circumstance!
---for although I did not serve with General Sir ------ ------, yet
I had an opportunity of knowing the names of the officers who
held situations in his family, and I cannot recollect that of
Lovel. ''

  At this observation Lovel again blushed so deeply as to attract
the attention of the whole company, while, a scornful laugh
seemed to indicate Captain M`Intyre's triumph. ``There is
something strange in this,'' said Oldbuck to himself; ``but I
will not readily give up my phoenix of post-chaise companions
---all his actions, language, and bearing, are those of a
gentleman.''

  Lovel in the meanwhile had taken out his pocket-book, and
selecting a letter, from which he took off the envelope, he handed
it to M`lntyre. ``You know the General's hand, in all probability---
I own I ought not to show these exaggerated expressions
of his regard and esteem for me.'' The letter contained a very
handsome compliment from the officer in question for some
military service lately performed. Captain M`Intyre, as be
glanced his eye over it, could not deny that it was written in
the General's hand, but drily observed, as be returned it, that
the address was wanting. ``The address, Captain M`Intyre,''
answered Lovel, in the same tone, ``shall be at your service
whenever you choose to inquire after it!''

  ``I certainly shall not fail to do so,'' rejoined the soldier.

  ``Come, come,'' exclaimed Oldbuck, ``what is the meaning of
all this? Have we got Hiren here?---We'll have no swaggering
youngsters. Are you come from the wars abroad, to stir
up domestic strife in our peaceful land? Are you like bull-dog
puppies, forsooth, that when the bull, poor fellow, is removed
from the ring, fall to brawl among themselves, worry each other,
and bite honest folk's shins that are standing by?''

  Sir Arthur trusted, he said, the young gentlemen would not
so far forget themselves as to grow warm upon such a trifling
subject as the back of a letter.

  Both the disputants disclaimed any such intention, and, with
high colour and flashing eyes, protested they were never so cool
in their lives. But an obvious damp was cast over the party;
---they talked in future too much by the rule to be sociable,
and Lovel, conceiving himself the object of cold and suspicious
looks from the rest of the company, and sensible that his indirect
replies had given them permission to entertain strange opinions
respecting him, made a gallant determination to sacrifice the
pleasure he had proposed in spending the day at Knockwinnock.

  He affected, therefore, to complain of a violent headache,
occasioned by the heat of the day, to which he had not been
exposed since his illness, and made a formal apology to Sir
Arthur, who, listening more to recent suspicion than to the
gratitude due for former services, did not press him to keep his
engagement more than good-breeding exactly demanded.

  When Lovel took leave of the ladies, Miss Wardour's manner
seemed more anxious than he had hitherto remarked it. She
indicated by a glance of her eye towards Captain M`Intyre,
perceptible only by Lovel, the subject of her alarm, and hoped,
in a voice greatly under her usual tone, it was not a less pleasant
engagement which deprived them of the pleasure of Mr. Lovel's
company. ``No engagement had intervened,'' he assured her;
``it was only the return of a complaint by which he had been
for some time occasionally attacked.''

  ``The best remedy in such a case is prudence, and I---every
friend of Mr. Lovel's will expect him to employ it.''

  Lovel bowed low and coloured deeply, and Miss Wardour, as
if she felt that she had said too much, turned and got into the
carriage. Lovel had next to part with Oldbuck, who, during
this interval, had, with Caxon's assistance, been arranging his
disordered periwig, and brushing his coat, which exhibited some
marks of the rude path they had traversed. ``What, man!''
said Oldbuck, ``you are not going to leave us on account of
that foolish Hector's indiscreet curiosity and vehemence? Why,
he is a thoughtless boy---a spoiled child from the time he was
in the nurse's arms---he threw his coral and bells at my head
for refusing him a bit of sugar; and you have too much sense
to mind such a shrewish boy: _<ae>quam servare mentem_ is the
motto of our friend Horace. I'll school Hector by and by, and
put it all to rights.'' But Lovel persisted in his design of returning
to Fairport.

  The Antiquary then assumed a graver tone.---``Take heed,
young man, to your present feelings. Your life has been given
yon for useful and valuable purposes, and should be reserved to
illustrate the literature of your country, when you are not called
upon to expose it in her defence, or in the rescue of the innocent. 
Private war, a practice unknown to the civilised ancients, is, of
all the absurdities introduced by the Gothic tribes, the most
gross, impious, and cruel. Let me hear no more of these absurd
quarrels, and I will show you the treatise upon the duello,
which I composed when the town-clerk and provost Mucklewhame
chose to assume the privileges of gentlemen, and
challenged each other. I thought of printing my Essay, which
is signed _Pacificator;_ but there was no need, as the matter
was taken up by the town-council of the borough.''

  ``But I assure you, my dear sir, there is nothing between
Captain M`Intyre and me that can render such respectable
interference necessary.''

  ``See it be so; for otherwise, I will stand second to both
parties.''

  So saying, the old gentleman got into the chaise, close to
which Miss M`Intyre had detained her brother, upon the same
principle that the owner of a quarrelsome dog keeps him by his
side to prevent his fastening upon another. But Hector contrived
to give her precaution the slip, for, as he was on horseback,
he lingered behind the carriages until they had fairly turned
the corner in the road to Knockwinnock, and then, wheeling
his horse's head round, gave him the spur in the opposite
direction.

  A very few minutes brought him up with Lovel, who, perhaps
anticipating his intention, had not put his horse beyond a slow
walk, when the clatter of hoofs behind him announced Captain
M`lntyre. The young soldier, his natural heat of temper
exasperated by the rapidity of motion, reined his horse up
suddenly and violently by Lovel's side, and touching his hat
slightly, inquired, in a very haughty tone of voice, ``What am
I to understand, sir, by your telling me that your address was
at my service?''

  ``Simply, sir,'' replied Lovel, ``that my name is Lovel, and
that my residence is, for the present, Fairport, as you will see
by this card.''

  ``And is this all the information you are disposed to give
me?''

  ``I see no right you have to require more.''

  ``I find you, sir, in company with my sister,'' said the young
soldier, ``and I have a right to know who is admitted into Miss
M`Intyre's society.''

  ``I shall take the liberty of disputing that right,'' replied
Lovel, with a manner as haughty as that of the young soldier;
---``you find me in society who are satisfied with the degree of
information on my affairs which I have thought proper to communicate,
and you, a mere stranger, have no right to inquire
further.''

  ``Mr. Lovel, if you served as you say you have''------

  ``If!'' interrupted Lovel,---``_if_ I have served as _I say_ I
have?''

  ``Yes, sir, such is my expression---_if_ you have so served, you
must know that you owe me satisfaction either in one way or
other.''

  ``If that be your opinion, I shall be proud to give it to you,
Captain M`Intyre, in the way in which the word is generally
used among gentlemen.''

  ``Very well, sir,'' rejoined Hector, and, turning his horse
round, galloped off to overtake his party.

  His absence had already alarmed them, and his sister, having
stopped the carriage, had her neck stretched out of the window
to see where he was.

  ``What is the matter with you now?'' said the Antiquary,
``riding to and fro as your neck were upon the wager---why do
you not keep up with the carriage?''

  ``I forgot my glove, sir,'' said Hector.

  ``Forgot your glove!---I presume you meant to say you went
to throw it down---But I will take order with you, my young
gentleman---you shall return with me this night to Monkbarns.''
So saying, he bid the postilion go on.
