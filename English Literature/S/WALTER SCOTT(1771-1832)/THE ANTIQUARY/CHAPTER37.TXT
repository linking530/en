	Yes! I love justice well---as well as you do---
	But since the good dame's blind, she shall excuse me
	If, time and reason fitting, I prove dumb;---
	The breath I utter now shall be no means
	To take away from me my breath in future.
					Old Play.

  By dint of charity from the town's-people in aid of the load of
provisions he had brought with him into durance, Edie Ochiltree
had passed a day or two's confinement without much impatience,
regretting his want of freedom the less, as the weather proved
broken and rainy.

  ``The prison,'' he said, ``wasna sae dooms bad a place as it
was ca'd. Ye had aye a good roof ower your head to fend aff
the weather, and, if the windows werena glazed, it was the mair
airy and pleasant for the summer season. And there were folk
enow to crack wi', and he had bread eneugh to eat, and what
need he fash himsell about the rest o't?''

  The courage of our philosophical mendicant began, however,
to abate, when the sunbeams shone fair on the rusty bars of his
grated dungeon, and a miserable linnet, whose cage some poor
debtor had obtained permission to attach to the window, began
to greet them with his whistle.

  ``Ye're in better spirits than I am,'' said Edie, addressing
the bird, ``for I can neither whistle nor sing for thinking o' the
bonny burnsides and green shaws that I should hae been dandering
beside in weather like this. But hae---there's some
crumbs t'ye, an ye are sae merry; and troth ye hae some reason
to sing an ye kent it, for your cage comes by nae faut o' your
ain, and I may thank mysell that I am closed up in this weary
place.''

  Ochiltree's soliloquy was disturbed by a peace-officer, who
came to summon him to attend the magistrate. So he set forth
in awful procession between two poor creatures, neither of them
so stout as he was himself, to be conducted into the presence of
inquisitorial justice. The people, as the aged prisoner was led
along by his decrepit guards, exclaimed to each other, ``Eh! see
sic a grey-haired man as that is, to have committed a highway
robbery, wi' ae fit in the grave!''---And the children congratulated
the officers, objects of their alternate dread and sport,
Puggie Orrock and Jock Ormston, on having a prisoner as old
as themselves.

  Thus marshalled forward, Edie was presented (by no means
for the first time) before the worshipful Bailie Littlejohn, who,
contrary to what his name expressed, was a tall portly magistrate,
on whom corporation crusts had not been conferred in
vain. He was a zealous loyalist of that zealous time, somewhat
rigorous and peremptory in the execution of his duty,
and a good deal inflated with the sense of his own power and
importance;---otherwise an honest, well-meaning, and useful
citizen.

  ``Bring him in! bring him in!'' he exclaimed. ``Upon my
word these are awful and unnatural times! the very bedesmen
and retainers of his Majesty are the first to break his laws. 
Here has been an old Blue-Gown committing robbery---I suppose
the next will reward the royal charity which supplies him with
his garb, pension, and begging license, by engaging in high-treason,
or sedition at least---But bring him in.''

  Edie made his obeisance, and then stood, as usual, firm and
erect, with the side of his face turned a little upward, as if to
catch every word which the magistrate might address to him. 
To the first general questions, which respected only his name
and calling, the mendicant answered with readiness and accuracy;
but when the magistrate, having caused his clerk to
take down these particulars, began to inquire whereabout the
mendicant was on the night when Dousterswivel met with his
misfortune, Edie demurred to the motion. ``Can ye tell me
now, Bailie, you that understands the law, what gude will it do
me to answer ony o' your questions?''

  ``Good?---no good certainly, my friend, except that giving
a true account of yourself, if you are innocent, may entitle me
to set you at liberty.''

  ``But it seems mair reasonable to me now, that you, Bailie,
or anybody that has anything to say against me, should prove
my guilt, and no to be bidding me prove my innocence.''

  ``I don't sit here,'' answered the magistrate, ``to dispute
points of law with you. I ask you, if you choose to answer my
question, whether you were at Ringan Aikwood, the forester's,
upon the day I have specified?''

  ``Really, sir, I dinna feel myself called on to remember,''
replied the cautious bedesman.

  ``Or whether, in the course of that day or night,'' continued
the magistrate, ``you saw Steven, or Steenie, Mucklebackit?---
you knew him, I suppose?''

  ``O, brawlie did I ken Steenie, puir fallow,'' replied the
prisoner;---``but I canna condeshend on ony particular time I
have seen him lately.''

  ``Were you at the ruins of St. Ruth any time in the course
of that evening?''

  ``Bailie Littlejohn,'' said the mendicant, ``if it be your
honour's pleasure, we'll cut a lang tale short, and I'll just tell
ye, I am no minded to answer ony o' thae questions---I'm ower
auld a traveller to let my tongue bring me into trouble.''

  ``Write down,'' said the magistrate, ``that he declines to
answer all interrogatories, in respect that by telling the truth
he might be brought to trouble.''

  ``Na, na,'' said Ochiltree, ``I'll no hae that set down as ony
part o' my answer---but I just meant to say, that in a' my
memory and practice, I never saw ony gude come o' answering
idle questions.''

  ``Write down,'' said the Bailie, ``that, being acquainted with
judicial interrogatories by long practice, and having sustained
injury by answering questions put to him on such occasions,
the declarant refuses''------

  ``Na, na, Bailie,'' reiterated Edie, ``ye are no to come in on
me that gait neither.''

  ``Dictate the answer yourself then, friend,'' said the magistrate,
``and the clerk will take it down from your own mouth.''

  ``Ay, ay,'' said Edie---``that's what I ca' fair play; I'se do
that without loss o' time. Sae, neighbour, ye may just write
down, that Edie Ochiltree, the declarant, stands up for the
liberty---na, I maunna say that neither---I am nae liberty-boy
---I hae fought again' them in the riots in Dublin---besides, I
have ate the King's bread mony a day. Stay, let me see. Ay
---write that Edie Ochiltree, the Blue-Gown, stands up for the
prerogative---(see that ye spell that word right---it's a lang ane)
---for the prerogative of the subjects of the land, and winna
answer a single word that sall be asked at him this day, unless
he sees a reason fort. Put down that, young man.''

  ``Then, Edie,'' said the magistrate, ``since you will give
no information on the subject, I must send you back to prison
till you shall be delivered in due course of law.''

  ``Aweel, sir, if it's Heaven's will and man's will, nae doubt
I maun submit,'' replied the mendicant. ``I hae nae great
objection to the prison, only that a body canna win out o't;
and if it wad please you as weel, Bailie, I wad gie you my word
to appear afore the Lords at the Circuit, or in ony other coart
ye like, on ony day ye are pleased to appoint.''

  ``I rather think, my good friend,'' answered Bailie Littlejohn,
``your word might be a slender security where your neck may
be in some danger. I am apt to think you would suffer the
pledge to be forfeited. If you could give me sufficient security,
indeed''------

  At this moment the Antiquary and Captain M`Intyre entered
the apartment.---``Good morning to you, gentlemen,'' said the
magistrate; ``you find me toiling in my usual vocation---
looking after the iniquities of the people---labouring for the
_respublica,_ Mr. Oldbuck---serving the King our master, Captain
M`Intyre,---for I suppose you know I have taken up the
sword?''

  ``It is one of the emblems of justice, doubtless,'' answered
the Antiquary;---``but I should have thought the scales would
have suited you better, Bailie, especially as you have them ready
in the warehouse.''

  ``Very good, Monkbarns---excellent! But I do not take the
sword up as justice, but as a soldier---indeed I should rather
say the musket and bayonet---there they stand at the elbow of
my gouty chair, for I am scarce fit for drill yet---a slight touch
of our old acquaintance _podagra;_ I can keep my feet, however,
while our sergeant puts me through the manual. I should
like to know, Captain M`Intyre, if he follows the regulations
correctly---he brings us but awkwardly to the _present._'' And
he hobbled towards his weapon to illustrate his doubts and
display his proficiency.

  ``I rejoice we have such zealous defenders, Bailie,'' replied
Mr. Oldbuck; ``and I dare say Hector will gratify you by
communicating his opinion on your progress in this new calling. 
Why, you rival the Hecat<e'> of the ancients, my good sir---a
merchant on the Mart, a magistrate in the Townhouse, a soldier
on the Links---_quid non pro patria?_ But my business is with
the justice; so let commerce and war go slumber.''

  ``Well, my good sir,'' said the Bailie, ``and what commands
have you for me?''

  ``Why, here's an old acquaintance of mine, called Edie
Ochiltree, whom some of your myrmidons have mewed up in
jail on account of an alleged assault on that fellow Dousterswivel,
of whose accusation I do not believe one word.''

  The magistrate here assumed a very grave countenance. 
``You ought to have been informed that he is accused of
robbery, as well as assault---a very serious matter indeed; it is
not often such criminals come under my cognizance.''

  ``And,'' replied Oldbuck, ``you are tenacious of the opportunity
of making the very most of such as occur. But is this poor old
man's case really so very bad?''

  ``It is rather out of rule,'' said the Bailie---``but as you are
in the commission, Monkbarns, I have no hesitation to show
you Dousterswivel's declaration, and the rest of the precognition.''
And he put the papers into the Antiquary's hands,
who assumed his spectacles, and sat down in a corner to peruse
them.

  The officers, in the meantime, had directions to remove their
prisoner into another apartment; but before they could do so,
M`Intyre took an opportunity to greet old Edie, and to slip a
guinea into his hand.

  ``Lord bless your honour!'' said the old man; ``it's a young
soldier's gift, and it should surely thrive wi' an auld ane. I'se
no refuse it, though it's beyond my rules; for if they steek me
up here, my friends are like eneugh to forget me---out o'sight
out o'mind, is a true proverb; and it wadna be creditable for
me, that am the king's bedesman, and entitled to beg by word
of mouth, to be fishing for bawbees out at the jail window wi'
the fit o' a stocking, and a string.'' As he made this observation
he was conducted out of the apartment.

  Mr. Dousterswivel's declaration contained an exaggerated
account of the violence he had sustained, and also of his
loss.

  ``But what I should have liked to have asked him,'' said
Monkbarns, ``would have been his purpose in frequenting the
ruins of St. Ruth, so lonely a place, at such an hour, and with
such a companion as Edie Ochiltree. There is no road lies that
way, and I do not conceive a mere passion for the picturesque
would carry the German thither in such a night of storm and
wind. Depend upon it, he has been about some roguery, and
in all probability hath been caught in a trap of his own setting
---_Nec lex justitior ulla._''

  The magistrate allowed there was something mysterious in
that circumstance, and apologized for not pressing Dousterswivel,
as his declaration was voluntarily emitted. But for the support
of the main charge, he showed the declaration of the Aikwoods
concerning the state in which Dousterswivel was found, and
establishing the important fact that the mendicant had left the
barn in which he was quartered, and did not return to it again. 
Two people belonging to the Fairport undertaker, who had that
night been employed in attending the funeral of Lady Glenallan,
had also given declarations, that, being sent to pursue two
suspicious persons who left the ruins of St. Ruth as the funeral
approached, and who, it was supposed, might have been pillaging
some of the ornaments prepared for the ceremony, they had lost
and regained sight of them more than once, owing to the nature
of the ground, which was unfavourable for riding, but had at
length fairly lodged them both in Mucklebackit's cottage. And
one of the men added, that ``he, the declarant, having dismounted
from his horse, and gone close up to the window of the
hut, he saw the old Blue-Gown and young Steenie Mucklebackit,
with others, eating and drinking in the inside, and also observed
the said Steenie Mucklebackit show a pocket-book to the others;
---and declarant has no doubt that Ochiltree and Steenie
Mucklebackit were the persons whom he and his comrade had
pursued, as above mentioned.'' And being interrogated why he
did not enter the said cottage, declares, ``he had no warrant so
to do; and that as Mucklebackit and his family were understood
to be rough-handed folk, he, the declarant, had no desire to
meddle or make with their affairs, _Causa scienti<ae> patet._ All
which he declares to be truth,'' etc.

  ``What do you say to that body of evidence against your
friend?'' said the magistrate, when he had observed the Antiquary
had turned the last leaf.

  ``Why, were it in the case of any other person, I own I
should say it looked, _prima facie,_ a little ugly; but I cannot
allow anybody to be in the wrong for beating Dousterswivel---
Had I been an hour younger, or had but one single flash of your
warlike genius, Bailie, I should have done it myself long ago. 
He is _nebulo nebulonum,_ an impudent, fraudulent, mendacious
quack, that has cost me a hundred pounds by his roguery, and
my neighbour Sir Arthur, God knows how much. And besides,
Bailie, I do not hold him to be a sound friend to Government.''

  ``Indeed?'' said Bailie Littlejohn; ``if I thought that, it
would alter the question considerably.''

  ``Right---for, in beating him,'' observed Oldbuck, ``the
bedesman must have shown his gratitude to the king by
thumping his enemy; and in robbing him, he would only have
plundered an Egyptian, whose wealth it is lawful to spoil. 
Now, suppose this interview in the ruins of St. Ruth had relation
to politics,---and this story of hidden treasure, and so
forth, was a bribe from the other side of the water for some
great man, or the funds destined to maintain a seditious club?''

  ``My dear sir,'' said the magistrate, catching at the idea,
``you hit my very thoughts! How fortunate should I be if I
could become the humble means of sifting such a matter to the
bottom!---Don't you think we had better call out the volunteers,
and put them on duty?''

  ``Not just yet, while _podagra_ deprives them of an essential
member of their body. But will you let me examine Ochiltree?''

  ``Certainly; but you'll make nothing of him. He gave me
distinctly to understand he knew the danger of a judicial
declaration on the part of an accused person, which, to say the
truth, has hanged many an honester man than he is.''

  ``Well, but, Bailie,'' continued Oldbuck, ``you have no objection
to let me try him?''

  ``None in the world, Monkbarns. I hear the sergeant below
---I'll rehearse the manual in the meanwhile. Baby, carry my
gun and bayonet down to the room below---it makes less noise
there when we ground arms.'' And so exit the martial magistrate,
with his maid behind him bearing his weapons.

  ``A good squire that wench for a gouty champion,'' observed
Oldbuck.---``Hector, my lad, hook on, hook on---Go with him,
boy---keep him employed, man, for half-an-hour or so---butter
him with some warlike terms---praise his dress and address.''

  Captain M`Intyre, who, like many of his profession, looked
down with infinite scorn on those citizen soldiers who had
assumed arms without any professional title to bear them, rose
with great reluctance, observing that he should not know what
to say to Mr. Littlejohn; and that to see an old gouty shop-keeper
attempting the exercise and duties of a private soldier,
was really too ridiculous.

  ``It may be so, Hector,'' said the Antiquary, who seldom
agreed with any person in the immediate proposition which
was laid down---``it may possibly be so in this and some other
instances; but at present the country resembles the suitors in a
small-debt court, where parties plead in person, for lack of cash
to retain the professed heroes of the bar. I am sure in the one
case we never regret the want of the acuteness and eloquence
of the lawyers; and so, I hope, in the other, we may manage to
make shift with our hearts and muskets, though we shall lack
some of the discipline of you martinets.''

  ``I have no objection, I am sure, sir, that the whole world
should fight if they please, if they will but allow me to be
quiet,'' said Hector, rising with dogged reluctance.

  ``Yes, you are a very quiet personage indeed,'' said his uncle,
``whose ardour for quarrelling cannot pass so much as a poor
_phoca_ sleeping upon the beach!''

  But Hector, who saw which way the conversation was tending,
and hated all allusions to the foil he had sustained from
the fish, made his escape before the Antiquary concluded the
sentence.
