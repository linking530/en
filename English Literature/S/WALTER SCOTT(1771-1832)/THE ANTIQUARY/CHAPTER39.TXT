	Full of wise saws and modern instances.
					As You Like It.

  ``I wish to Heaven, Hector,'' said the Antiquary, next
morning after breakfast, ``you would spare our nerves, and not
be keeping snapping that arquebuss of yours.''

  ``Well, sir, I'm sure I'm sorry to disturb you,'' said his nephew,
still handling his fowling-piece;---``but it's a capital gun---it's
a Joe Manton, that cost forty guineas.''

  ``A fool and his money are soon parted, nephew---there is a
Joe Miller for your Joe Manton,'' answered the Antiquary; ``I
am glad you have so many guineas to throw away.''

  ``Every one has their fancy, uncle,---you are fond of books.''

  ``Ay, Hector,'' said the uncle, ``and if my collection were
yours, you would make it fly to the gunsmith, the horse-market,
the dog-breaker,---_Coemptos undique nobiles libros---mutare
loricis Iberis._''

  ``I could not use your books, my dear uncle,'' said the young
soldier, ``that's true; and you will do well to provide for their
being in better hands. But don't let the faults of my head fall
on my heart---I would not part with a Cordery that belonged
to an old friend, to get a set of horses like Lord Glenallan's.''

  ``I don't think you would, lad---I don't think you would,''
said his softening relative. ``I love to tease you a little
sometimes; it keeps up the spirit of discipline and habit of
subordination---You will pass your time happily here having
me to command you, instead of Captain, or Colonel, or `Knight
in Arms,' as Milton has it; and instead of the French,'' he
continued, relapsing into his ironical humour, ``you have the
_Gens humida ponti_---for, as Virgil says,

	Sternunt se somno divers<ae> in littore phoc<ae>;

which might be rendered,

	Here phoc<ae> slumber on the beach,
	Within our Highland Hector's reach.

Nay, if you grow angry, I have done. Besides, I see old Edie
in the court-yard, with whom I have business. Good-bye,
Hector---Do you remember how she splashed into the sea like
her master Proteus, _et se jactu dedit <ae>quor in altum_?''

  M`Intyre,---waiting, however, till the door was shut,---then
gave way to the natural impatience of his temper.

  ``My uncle is the best man in the world, and in his way
the kindest; but rather than hear any more about that cursed
_phoca,_ as he is pleased to call it, I would exchange for the
West Indies, and never see his face again.''

  Miss M`Intyre, gratefully attached to her uncle, and passionately
fond of her brother, was, on such occasions, the usual
envoy of reconciliation. She hastened to meet her uncle on his
return, before he entered the parlour.

  ``Well, now, Miss Womankind, what is the meaning of that
imploring countenance?---has Juno done any more mischief?''

  ``No, uncle; but Juno's master is in such fear of your joking
him about the seal---I assure you, he feels it much more than
you would wish;---it's very silly of him, to be sure; but then
you can turn everybody so sharply into ridicule''------

  ``Well, my dear,'' answered Oldbuck, propitiated by the
compliment, ``I will rein in my satire, and, if possible, speak
no more of the _phoca_---I will not even speak of sealing a letter,
but say _umph,_ and give a nod to you when I want the wax-light
---I am not _monitoribus asper,_ but, Heaven knows, the most
mild, quiet, and easy of human beings, whom sister, niece, and
nephew, guide just as best pleases them.''

  With this little panegyric on his own docility, Mr. Oldbuck
entered the parlour, and proposed to his nephew a walk to the
Mussel-crag. ``I have some questions to ask of a woman at
Mucklebackit's cottage,'' he observed, ``and I would willingly
have a sensible witness with me---so, for fault of a better, Hector,
I must be contented with you.''

  ``There is old Edie, sir, or Caxon---could not they do better
than me?'' answered M`Intyre, feeling somewhat alarmed at the
prospect of a long _t<e^>te-<a`>-t<e^>te_ with his uncle.

  ``Upon my word, young man, you turn me over to pretty
companions, and I am quite sensible of your politeness,'' replied
Mr. Oldbuck. ``No, sir, I intend the old Blue-Gown shall go
with me---not as a competent witness, for he is, at present, as
our friend Bailie Littlejohn says (blessings on his learning!)
_tanquam suspectus,_ and you are _suspicione major,_ as our law has
it.''

  ``I wish I were a major, sir,'' said Hector, catching only the
last, and, to a soldier's ear, the most impressive word in the
sentence,---``but, without money or interest, there is little chance
of getting the step.''

  ``Well, well, most doughty son of Priam,'' said the Antiquary,
``be ruled by your friends, and there's no saying what may
happen---Come away with me, and you shall see what may be
useful to you should you ever sit upon a court-martial, sir.''

  ``I have been on many a regimental court-martial, sir,''
answered Captain M`Intyre. ``But here's a new cane for you.''

  ``Much obliged, much obliged.''

  ``I bought it from our drum-major,'' added M`Intyre, ``who
came into our regiment from the Bengal army when it came
down the Red Sea. It was cut on the banks of the Indus, I
assure you.''

  ``Upon my word, 'tis a fine ratan, and well replaces that
which the _ph_---Bah! what was I going to say?''

  The party, consisting of the Antiquary, his nephew, and the
old beggar, now took the sands towards Mussel-crag---the former
in the very highest mood of communicating information, and the
others, under a sense of former obligation, and some hope for
future favours, decently attentive to receive it. The uncle and
nephew walked together, the mendicant about a step and a half
behind, just near enough for his patron to speak to him by a
slight inclination of his neck, and without the trouble of turning
round. (Petrie, in his Essay on Good-breeding, dedicated to the
magistrates of Edinburgh, recommends, upon his own experience,
as tutor in a family of distinction, this attitude to all led captains,
tutors, dependants, and bottle-holders of every description.)
Thus escorted, the Antiquary moved along full of his learning,
like a lordly man of war, and every now and then yawing
to starboard and larboard to discharge a broadside upon his
followers.

  ``And so it is your opinion,'' said he to the mendicant, ``that
this windfall---this _arca auri,_ as Plautus has it, will not greatly
avail Sir Arthur in his necessities?''

  `Unless he could find ten times as much,'' said the beggar,
``and that I am sair doubtful of;---I heard Puggie Orrock, and
the tother thief of a sheriff-officer, or messenger, speaking about
it---and things are ill aff when the like o' them can speak
crousely about ony gentleman's affairs. I doubt Sir Arthur
will be in stane wa's for debt, unless there's swift help and
certain.''

  ``You speak like a fool,'' said the Antiquary.---``Nephew, it
is a remarkable thing, that in this happy country no man can
be legally imprisoned for debt.''

  ``Indeed, sir?'' said M`Intyre; ``I never knew that before---
that part of our law would suit some of our mess well.''

  ``And if they arena confined for debt,'' said Ochiltree, ``what
is't that tempts sae mony puir creatures to bide in the tolbooth
o' Fairport yonder?---they a' say they were put there by their
creditors---Od! they maun like it better than I do, if they're
there o' free will.''

  ``A very natural observation, Edie, and many of your betters
would make the same; but it is founded entirely upon ignorance
of the feudal system. Hector, be so good as to attend, unless
you are looking out for another---Ahem!'' (Hector compelled
himself to give attention at this hint.) ``And you, Edie, it may
be useful to you _reram cognoscere causas._ The nature and origin
of warrant for caption is a thing _haud alienum a Sc<ae>vol<ae> studiis._
---You must know then, once more, that nobody can be arrested
in Scotland for debt.''

  ``I haena muckle concern wi' that, Monkbarns,'' said the old
man, ``for naebody wad trust a bodle to a gaberlunzie.''

  ``I pr'ythee, peace, man------As a compulsitor, therefore, of
payment, that being a thing to which no debtor is naturally
inclined, as I have too much reason to warrant from the
experience I have had with my own,---we had first the letters
of four forms, a sort of gentle invitation, by which our sovereign
lord the king, interesting himself, as a monarch should, in the
regulation of his subjects' private affairs, at first by mild exhortation,
and afterwards by letters of more strict enjoinment and
more hard compulsion---What do you see extraordinary about
that bird, Hector?---it's but a seamaw.''

  ``It's a pictarnie, sir,'' said Edie.

  ``Well, what an if it were---what does that signify at present?
---But I see you're impatient; so I will waive the letters of four
forms, and come to the modern process of diligence.---You suppose,
now, a man's committed to prison because he cannot pay
his debt? Quite otherwise: the truth is, the king is so good as
to interfere at the request of the creditor, and to send the debtor
his royal command to do him justice within a certain time---
fifteen days, or six, as the case may be. Well, the man resists
and disobeys: what follows? Why, that he be lawfully and
rightfully declared a rebel to our gracious sovereign, whose command
he has disobeyed, and that by three blasts of a horn at
the market-place of Edinburgh, the metropolis of Scotland. 
And he is then legally imprisoned, not on account of any civil
debt, but because of his ungrateful contempt of the royal mandate.
What say you to that, Hector?---there's something you
never knew before.''<*>

* The doctrine of Monkbarns on the origin of imprisonment for civil
* debt in Scotland, may appear somewhat whimsical, but was referred to, and
* admitted to be correct, by the Bench of the Supreme Scottish Court, on 5th
* December 1828, in the case of Thom _v._ Black. In fact, the Scottish law
* is in this particular more jealous of the personal liberty of the subject than
* any other code in Europe.


  ``No, uncle; but, I own, if I wanted money to pay my debts,
I would rather thank the king to send me some, than to declare
me a rebel for not doing what I could not do.''

  ``Your education has not led you to consider these things,''
replied his uncle; ``you are incapable of estimating the elegance
of the legal fiction, and the manner in which it reconciles that
duress, which, for the protection of commerce, it has been found
necessary to extend towards refractory debtors, with the most
scrupulous attention to the liberty of the subject.''

  ``I don't know, sir,'' answered the unenlightened Hector; ``but
if a man must pay his debt or go to jail, it signifies but little
whether he goes as a debtor or a rebel, I should think. But you
say this command of the king's gives a license of so many days
---Now, egad, were I in the scrape, I would beat a march and
leave the king and the creditor to settle it among themselves
before they came to extremities.''

  ``So wad I,'' said Edie; ``I wad gie them leg-bail to a
certainty.''

  ``True,'' replied Monkbarns; ``but those whom the law suspects
of being unwilling to abide her formal visit, she proceeds
with by means of a shorter and more unceremonious call, as
dealing with persons on whom patience and favour would be
utterly thrown away.''

  ``Ay,'' said Ochiltree, ``that will be what they ca' the fugie-warrants
--I hae some skeel in them. There's Border-warrants
too in the south country, unco rash uncanny things;---I was
taen up on ane at Saint James's Fair, and keepit in the auld
kirk at Kelso the haill day and night; and a cauld goustie
place it was, I'se assure ye.---But whatna wife's this, wi' her
creel on her back? It's puir Maggie hersell, I'm thinking.''

  It was so. The poor woman's sense of her loss, if not diminished,
was become at least mitigated by the inevitable necessity
of attending to the means of supporting her family; and her
salutation to Oldbuck was made in an odd mixture between the
usual language of solicitation with which she plied her customers,
and the tone of lamentation for her recent calamity.

  ``How's a' wi' ye the day, Monkbarns? I havena had the
grace yet to come down to thank your honour for the credit ye
did puir Steenie, wi' laying his head in a rath grave, puir fallow.''
---Here she whimpered and wiped her eyes with the corner of
her blue apron---``But the fishing comes on no that ill, though
the gudeman hasna had the heart to gang to sea himsell---
Atweel I would fain tell him it wad do him gude to put hand to
wark---but I'm maist fear'd to speak to him---and it's an unco
thing to hear ane o' us speak that gate o' a man---However, I
hae some dainty caller haddies, and they sall be but three
shillings the dozen, for I hae nae pith to drive a bargain ennow,
and maun just tak what ony Christian body will gie, wi' few
words and nae flyting.''

  ``What shall we do, Hector?'' said Oldbuck, pausing: ``I got
into disgrace with my womankind for making a bad bargain
with her before. These maritime animals, Hector, are unlucky
to our family.''

  ``Pooh, sir, what would you do?---give poor Maggie what she
asks, or allow me to send a dish of fish up to Monkbarns.''

  And he held out the money to her; but Maggie drew back
her hand. ``Na, na, Captain; ye're ower young and ower free
o' your siller---ye should never tak a fish-wife's first bode; and
troth I think maybe a flyte wi' the auld housekeeper at Monkbarns,
or Miss Grizel, would do me some gude---And I want to
see what that hellicate quean Jenny Ritherout's doing---folk
said she wasna weel---She'll be vexing hersell about Steenie,
the silly tawpie, as if he wad ever hae lookit ower his shouther
at the like o'her!---Weel, Monkbarns, they're braw caller haddies,
and they'll bid me unco little indeed at the house if ye want
crappit-heads the day.''

  And so on she paced with her burden,---grief, gratitude for
the sympathy of her betters, and the habitual love of traffic and
of gain, chasing each other through her thoughts.

  ``And now that we are before the door of their hut,'' said
Ochiltree, ``I wad fain ken, Monkbarns, what has gar'd ye plague
yoursell wi' me a' this length? I tell ye sincerely I hae nae
pleasure in ganging in there. I downa bide to think how the
young hae fa'en on a' sides o' me, and left me an useless auld
stump wi' hardly a green leaf on't.''

  ``This old woman,'' said Oldbuck, ``sent you on a message to
the Earl of Glenallan, did she not?''

  ``Ay!'' said the surprised mendicant; ``how ken ye that sae
weel?''

  ``Lord Glenallan told me himself,'' answered the Antiquary;
``so there is no delation---no breach of trust on your part; and
as he wishes me to take her evidence down on some important
family matters, I chose to bring you with me, because in her
situation, hovering between dotage and consciousness, it is
possible that your voice and appearance may awaken trains of recollection
which I should otherwise have no means of exciting. 
The human mind---what are you about, Hector?''

  ``I was only whistling for the dog, sir,'' replied the Captain
``she always roves too wide---I knew I should be troublesome
to you.''

  ``Not at all, not at all,'' said Oldbuck, resuming the subject
of his disquisition---``the human mind is to be treated like a
skein of ravelled silk, where you must cautiously secure one
free end before you can make any progress in disentangling it.''

  ``I ken naething about that,'' said the gaberlunzie; ``but an
my auld acquaintance be hersell, or anything like hersell, she
may come to wind us a pirn. It's fearsome baith to see and hear
her when she wampishes about her arms, and gets to her English,
and speaks as if she were a prent book, let a-be an auld fisher's
wife. But, indeed, she had a grand education, and was muckle
taen out afore she married an unco bit beneath hersell. She's
aulder than me by half a score years---but I mind weel eneugh
they made as muckle wark about her making a half-merk marriage
wi' Simon Mucklebackit, this Saunders's father, as if she had
been ane o' the gentry. But she got into favour again, and
then she lost it again, as I hae heard her son say, when he was
a muckle chield; and then they got muckle siller, and left the
Countess's land, and settled here. But things never throve wi'
them. Howsomever, she's a weel-educate woman, and an she
win to her English, as I hae heard her do at an orra time, she
may come to fickle us a'.''
