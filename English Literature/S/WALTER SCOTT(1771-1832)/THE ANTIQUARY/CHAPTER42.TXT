	Let those go see who will---I like it not---
	For, say he was a slave to rank and pomp,
	And all the nothings he is now divorced from
	By the hard doom of stern necessity:
	Yet it is sad to mark his altered brow,
	Where Vanity adjusts her flimsy veil
	O'er the deep wrinkles of repentant anguish.
						Old Play.

  When Miss Wardour arrived in the court of the Castle, she
was apprized by the first glance that the visit of the officers of
the law had already taken place. There was confusion, and
gloom and sorrow, and curiosity among the domestics, while
the retainers of the law went from place to place, making an
inventory of the goods and chattels falling under their warrant
of distress, or poinding, as it is called in the law of Scotland. 
Captain M`Intyre flew to her, as, struck dumb with the melancholy
conviction of her father's ruin, she paused upon the threshold
of the gateway.

  ``Dear Miss Wardour,'' he said, ``do not make yourself uneasy;
my uncle is coming immediately, and I am sure he will
find some way to clear the house of these rascals.''

  ``Alas! Captain M`Intyre, I fear it will be too late.''

  ``No,'' answered Edie, impatiently---``could I but get to
Tannonburgh. In the name of Heaven, Captain, contrive some
way to get me on, and ye'll do this poor ruined family the best
day's doing that has been done them since Redhand's days---for
as sure as e'er an auld saw came true, Knockwinnock house and
land will be lost and won this day.''

  ``Why, what good can you do, old man?'' said Hector.

  But Robert, the domestic with whom Sir Arthur had been so
much displeased in the morning, as if he had been watching for
an opportunity to display his zeal, stepped hastily forward and
said to his mistress, ``If you please, ma'am, this auld man,
Ochiltree, is very skeely and auld-farrant about mony things, as
the diseases of cows and horse, and sic like, and I am sure be
disna want to be at Tannonburgh the day for naething, since
he insists on't this gate; and, if your leddyship pleases, I'll
drive him there in the taxed-cart in an hour's time. I wad fain
be of some use---I could bite my very tongue out when I think
on this morning.''

  ``I am obliged to you, Robert,'' said Miss Wardour; ``and if
you really think it has the least chance of being useful''-------

  ``In the name of God,'' said the old man, ``yoke the cart,
Robie, and if I am no o' some use, less or mair, I'll gie ye leave
to fling me ower Kittlebrig as ye come back again. But, O man,
haste ye, for time's precious this day.''

  Robert looked at his mistress as she retired into the house,
and seeing he was not prohibited, flew to the stable-yard, which
was adjacent to the court, in order to yoke the, carriage; for,
though an old beggar was the personage least likely to render
effectual assistance in a case of pecuniary distress, yet there was
among the common people of Edie's circle, a general idea of his
prudence and sagacity, which authorized Robert's conclusion
that he would not so earnestly have urged the necessity of this
expedition had he not been convinced of its utility. But so
soon as the servant took hold of a horse to harness him for
the taxed-cart, an officer touched him on the shoulder---``My
friend, you must let that beast alone---he's down in the
schedule.''

  ``What!'' said Robert, ``am I not to take my master's horse
to go my young leddy's errand?''

  ``You must remove nothing here,'' said the man of office,
``or you will be liable for all consequences.''

  ``What the devil, sir,'' said Hector, who having followed to
examine Ochiltree more closely on the nature of his hopes and
expectations, already began to bristle like one of the terriers of
his own native mountains, and sought but a decent pretext for
venting his displeasure, ``have you the impudence to prevent
the young lady's servant from obeying her orders?''

  There was something in the air and tone of the young soldier,
which seemed to argue that his interference was not likely to
be confined to mere expostulation; and which, if it promised
finally the advantages of a process of battery and deforcement,
would certainly commence with the unpleasant circumstances
necessary for founding such a complaint. The legal officer,
confronted with him of the military, grasped with one doubtful
hand the greasy bludgeon which was to enforce his authority,
and with the other produced his short official baton, tipped
with silver, and having a movable ring upon it---``Captain
M`Intyre,---Sir, I have no quarrel with you,---but if you interrupt
me in my duty, I will break the wand of peace, and declare
myself deforced.''

  ``And who the devil cares,'' said Hector, totally ignorant of
the words of judicial action, ``whether you declare yourself
divorced or married? And as to breaking your wand, or breaking
the peace, or whatever you call it, all I know is, that I will
break your bones if you prevent the lad from harnessing the
horses to obey his mistress's orders.''

  ``I take all who stand here to witness,'' said the messenger,
``that I showed him my blazon, and explained my character. 
He that will to Cupar maun to Cupar,''---and he slid his enigmatical
ring from one end of the baton to the other, being the
appropriate symbol of his having been forcibly interrupted in
the discharge of his duty.

  Honest Hector, better accustomed to the artillery of the field
than to that of the law, saw this mystical ceremony with great
indifference; and with like unconcern beheld the messenger sit
down to write out an execution of deforcement. But at this
moment, to prevent the well-meaning hot-headed Highlander
from running the risk of a severe penalty, the Antiquary arrived
puffing and blowing, with his handkerchief crammed under his
hat, and his wig upon the end of his stick.

  ``What the deuce is the matter here?'' he exclaimed, hastily
adjusting his head-gear; ``I have been following you in fear
of finding your idle loggerhead knocked against one rock or
other, and here I find you parted with your Bucephalus, and
quarrelling with Sweepclean. A messenger, Hector, is a worse
foe than a _phoca,_ whether it be the _phoca barbata,_ or the _phoca
vitulina_ of your late conflict.''

  ``D---n the _phoca,_ sir,'' said Hector, ``whether it be the one
or the other---I say d---n them both particularly! I think you
would not have me stand quietly by and see a scoundrel like
this, because he calls himself a king's messenger, forsooth---(I
hope the king has many better for his meanest errands)---insult
a young lady of family and fashion like Miss Wardour?''

  ``Rightly argued, Hector,'' said the Antiquary; ``but the
king, like other people, has now and then shabby errands, and,
in your ear, must have shabby fellows to do them. But even
supposing you unacquainted with the statutes of William the
Lion, in which _capite quarto versu quinto,_ this crime of deforcement
is termed _despectus Domini Regis_---a contempt, to wit, of
the king himself, in whose name all legal diligence issues,---
could you not have inferred, from the information I took so
much pains to give you to-day, that those who interrupt officers
who come to execute letters of caption, are _tanquam participes
criminis rebellionis?_ seeing that he who aids a rebel, is himself,
_quodammodo,_ an accessory to rebellion---But I'll bring you out of
this scrape.''

  He then spoke to the messenger, who, upon his arrival, had
laid aside all thoughts of making a good by-job out of the
deforcement, and accepted Mr. Oldbuck's assurances that the
horse and taxed-cart should be safely returned in the course of
two or three hours.

  ``Very well, sir,'' said the Antiquary, ``since you are disposed
to be so civil, you shall have another job in your own best way
---a little cast of state politics---a crime punishable _per Legem
Juliam,_ Mr. Sweepclean---Hark thee hither.''

  And after a whisper of five minutes, he gave him a slip of
paper, on receiving which, the messenger mounted his horse,
and, with one of his assistants, rode away pretty sharply. The
fellow who remained seemed to delay his operations purposely,
proceeded in the rest of his duty very slowly, and with the
caution and precision of one who feels himself overlooked by a
skilful and severe inspector.

  In the meantime, Oldbuck, taking his nephew by the arm,
led him into the house, and they were ushered into the presence
of Sir Arthur Wardour, who, in a flutter between wounded
pride, agonized apprehension, and vain attempts to disguise both
under a show of indifference, exhibited a spectacle of painful
interest.

  ``Happy to see you, Mr. Oldbuck---always happy to see my
friends in fair weather or foul,'' said the poor Baronet, struggling
not for composure, but for gaiety---an affectation which was
strongly contrasted by the nervous and protracted grasp of his
hand, and the agitation of his whole demeanour---``I am happy
to see you. You are riding, I see---I hope in this confusion
your horses are taken good care of---I always like to have my
friend's horses looked after---Egad! they will have all my care
now, for you see they are like to leave me none of my own---
he! he! he! eh, Mr. Oldbuck?''

  This attempt at a jest was attended by a hysterical giggle,
which poor Sir Arthur intended should sound as an indifferent
laugh.

  ``You know I never ride, Sir Arthur,'' said the Antiquary.

  ``I beg your pardon; but sure I saw your nephew arrive on
horseback a short time since. We must look after officers'
horses, and his was as handsome a grey charger as I have
seen.''

  Sir Arthur was about to ring the bell, when Mr. Oldbuck
said, ``My nephew came on your own grey horse, Sir Arthur.''

  ``Mine!'' said the poor Baronet; ``mine was it? then the
sun had been in my eyes. Well, I'm not worthy having a horse
any longer, since I don't know my own when I see him.''

  ``Good Heaven!'' thought Oldbuck, ``how is this man altered
from the formal stolidity of his usual manner!---he grows wanton
under adversity---_Sed pereunti mille figur<ae>._''---He then proceeded
aloud---``Sir Arthur, we must necessarily speak a little
on business.''

  ``To be sure,'' said Sir Arthur; ``but it was so good that I
should not know the horse I have ridden these five years---ha!
ha! ha!''

  ``Sir Arthur,'' said the Antiquary, ``don't let us waste time
which is precious; we shall have, I hope, many better seasons
for jesting---_desipere in loco_ is the maxim of Horace. I more
than suspect this has been brought on by the villany of
Dousterswivel.''

  ``Don't mention his name, sir!'' said Sir Arthur; and his
manner entirely changed from a fluttered affectation of gaiety
to all the agitation of fury; his eyes sparkled, his mouth
foamed, his hands were clenched---``don't mention his name,
sir,'' he vociferated, ``unless you would see me go mad in your
presence! That I should have been such a miserable dolt---
such an infatuated idiot---such a beast endowed with thrice a
beast's stupidity, to be led and driven and spur-galled by such a
rascal, and under such ridiculous pretences!---Mr. Oldbuck, I
could tear myself when I think of it.''

  ``I only meant to say,'' answered the Antiquary, ``that this
fellow is like to meet his reward; and I cannot but think we
shall frighten something out of him that may be of service to
you. He has certainly had some unlawful correspondence on
the other side of the water.''

  ``Has he?---has he?---has he indeed?---then d---n the house-hold
goods, horses, and so forth---I will go to prison a happy
man, Mr. Oldbuck. I hope in heaven there's a reasonable chance
of his being hanged?''

  ``Why, pretty fair,'' said Oldbuck, willing to encourage this
diversion, in hopes it might mitigate the feelings which seemed
like to overset the poor man's understanding; ``honester men
have stretched a rope, or the law has been sadly cheated---But
this unhappy business of yours---can nothing be done? Let me
see the charge.''

  He took the papers; and, as he read them, his countenance
grew hopelessly dark and disconsolate. Miss Wardour had by
this time entered the apartment, and fixing her eyes on Mr.
Oldbuck, as if she meant to read her fate in his looks, easily
perceived, from the change in his eye, and the dropping of his
nether-jaw, how little was to be hoped.

  ``We are then irremediably ruined, Mr. Oldbuck?'' said the
young lady.

  ``Irremediably?---I hope not---but the instant demand is very
large, and others will, doubtless, pour in.''

  ``Ay, never doubt that, Monkbarns,'' said Sir Arthur;
``where the slaughter is, the eagles will be gathered together. 
I am like a sheep which I have seen fall down a precipice, or
drop down from sickness---if you had not seen a single raven or
hooded crow for a fortnight before, he will not lie on the
heather ten minutes before half-a-dozen will be picking out his
eyes (and he drew his hand over his own), and tearing at his
heartstrings before the poor devil has time to die. But that
d---d long-scented vulture that dogged me so long---you have
got him fast, I hope?''

  ``Fast enough,'' said the Antiquary; ``the gentleman wished
to take the wings of the morning, and bolt in the what d'ye call
it,---the coach and four there. But he would have found twigs
limed for him at Edinburgh. As it is, he never got so far, for
the coach being overturned---as how could it go safe with such
a Jonah?---he has had an infernal tumble, is carried into a
cottage near Kittlebrig, and to prevent all possibility of escape,
I have sent your friend Sweepclean to bring him back to Fairport
_in nomine regis,_ or to act as his sick-nurse at Kittlebrig, as
is most fitting. And now, Sir Arthur, permit me to have some
conversation with you on the present unpleasant state of your
affairs, that we may see what can be done for their extrication;''
and the Antiquary led the way into the library, followed by the
unfortunate gentleman.

  They had been shut up together for about two hours, when
Miss Wardour interrupted them with her cloak on as if prepared
for a journey. Her countenance was very pale, yet expressive of
the composure which characterized her disposition.

  ``The messenger is returned, Mr. Oldbuck.''

  ``Returned?---What the devil! he has not let the fellow go?''

  ``No---I understand he has carried him to confinement; and
now he is returned to attend my father, and says he can wait
no longer.''

  A loud wrangling was now heard on the staircase, in which
the voice of Hector predominated. ``You an officer, sir, and
these ragamuffins a party! a parcel of beggarly tailor fellows---
tell yourselves off by nine, and we shall know your effective
strength.''

  The grumbling voice of the man of law was then heard
indistinctly muttering a reply, to which Hector retorted---
``Come, come, sir, this won't do;---march your party, as you
call them, out of this house directly, or I'll send you and them
to the right about presently.''

  ``The devil take Hector,'' said the Antiquary, hastening to the
scene of action; ``his Highland blood is up again, and we shall
have him fighting a duel with the bailiff. Come, Mr. Sweepclean,
you must give us a little time---I know you would not wish to
hurry Sir Arthur.''

  ``By no means, sir,'' said the messenger, putting his hat
off, which he had thrown on to testify defiance of Captain
M`Intyre's threats; ``but your nephew, sir, holds very uncivil
language, and I have borne too much of it already; and I am
not justified in leaving my prisoner any longer after the instructions
I received, unless I am to get payment of the sums
contained in my diligence.'' And he held out the caption,
pointing with the awful truncheon, which he held in his right
hand, to the formidable line of figures jotted upon the back
thereof.

  Hector, on the other hand, though silent from respect to his
uncle, answered this gesture by shaking his clenched fist at the
messenger with a frown of Highland wrath.

  ``Foolish boy, be quiet,'' said Oldbuck, ``and come with me
into the room---the man is doing his miserable duty, and you
will only make matters worse by opposing him.---I fear, Sir
Arthur, you must accompany this man to Fairport; there is no
help for it in the first instance---I will accompany you, to consult
what further can be done---My nephew will escort Miss
Wardour to Monkbarns, which I hope she will make her residence
until these unpleasant matters are settled.''

  ``I go with my father, Mr. Oldbuck,'' said Miss Wardour
firmly---``I have prepared his clothes and my own---I suppose
we shall have the use of the carriage?''

  ``Anything in reason, madam,'' said the messenger; ``I have
ordered it out, and it's at the door---I will go on the box with
the coachman---I have no desire to intrude---but two of the
concurrents must attend on horseback.''

  ``I will attend too,'' said Hector, and he ran down to secure
a horse for himself.

  ``We must go then,'' said the Antiquary.

  ``To jail,'' said the Baronet, sighing involuntarily. ``And
what of that?'' he resumed, in a tone affectedly cheerful---``it
is only a house we can't get out of, after all---Suppose a fit
of the gout, and Knockwinnock would be the same---Ay, ay,
Monkbarns---we'll call it a fit of the gout without the d---d
pain.''

  But his eyes swelled with tears as he spoke, and his faltering
accent marked how much this assumed gaiety cost him. The
Antiquary wrung his hand, and, like the Indian Banians, who
drive the real terms of an important bargain by signs, while
they are apparently talking of indifferent matters, the hand of
Sir Arthur, by its convulsive return of the grasp, expressed his
sense of gratitude to his friend, and the real state of his internal
agony.---They stepped slowly down the magnificent staircase---
every well-known object seeming to the unfortunate father and
daughter to assume a more prominent and distinct appearance
than usual, as if to press themselves on their notice for the last
time.

  At the first landing-place, Sir Arthur made an agonized
pause; and as he observed the Antiquary look at him anxiously,
he said with assumed dignity---``Yes, Mr. Oldbuck, the descendant
of an ancient line---the representative of Richard Redhand
and Gamelyn de Guardover, may be pardoned a sigh when he
leaves the castle of his fathers thus poorly escorted. When I
was sent to the Tower with my late father, in the year 1745, it
was upon a charge becoming our birth---upon an accusation of
high treason, Mr. Oldbuck;---we were escorted from Highgate
by a troop of life-guards, and committed upon a secretary of
state's warrant; and now, here I am, in my old age, dragged
from my household by a miserable creature like that'' (pointing
to the messenger), ``and for a paltry concern of pounds,
shillings, and pence.''

  ``At least,'' said Oldbuck, ``you have now the company of a
dutiful daughter, and a sincere friend, if you will permit me to
say so, and that may be some consolation, even without the
certainty that there can be no hanging, drawing, or quartering,
on the present occasion. But I hear that choleric boy as loud
as ever. I hope to God he has got into no new broil!---it was
an accursed chance that brought him here at all.''

  In fact, a sudden clamour, in which the loud voice and
somewhat northern accent of Hector was again preeminently
distinguished, broke off this conversation. The cause we must
refer to the next chapter.
