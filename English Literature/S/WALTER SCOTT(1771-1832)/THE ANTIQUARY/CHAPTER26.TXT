	O weel may the boatie row
	    And better may she speed,
	And weel may the boatie row
	    That earns the bairnies' bread!
	The boatie rows, the boatie rows,
	    The boatie rows fu' weel,
	And lightsome be their life that bear
	    The merlin and the creel!
				Old Ballad.

  We must now introduce our reader to the interior of the fisher's
cottage mentioned in chapter eleventh of this edifying history.
I wish I could say that its inside was well arranged, decently
furnished, or tolerably clean. On the contrary, I am compelled
to admit, there was confusion,---there was dilapidation,---there was
dirt good store. Yet, with all this, there was about the inmates,
Luckie Mucklebackit and her family, an appearance of ease,
plenty, and comfort, that seemed to warrant their old sluttish
proverb, ``The clartier the cosier.'' A huge fire, though the
season was summer, occupied the hearth, and served at once for
affording light, heat, and the means of preparing food. The
fishing had been successful, and the family, with customary improvidence,
had, since unlading the cargo, continued an unremitting
operation of broiling and frying that part of the produce
reserved for home consumption, and the bones and fragments lay
on the wooden trenchers, mingled with morsels of broken bannocks
and shattered mugs of half-drunk beer. The stout and athletic
form of Maggie herself, bustling here and there among a pack of
half-grown girls and younger children, of whom she chucked one
now here and another now there, with an exclamation of ``Get
out o' the gate, ye little sorrow!'' was strongly contrasted with
the passive and half-stupified look and manner of her husband's
mother, a woman advanced to the last stage of human life, who
was seated in her wonted chair close by the fire, the warmth of
which she coveted, yet hardly seemed to be sensible of---now
muttering to herself, now smiling vacantly to the children as they
pulled the strings of her _toy_ or close cap, or twitched her blue
checked apron. With her distaff in her bosom, and her spindle
in her hand, she plied lazily and mechanically the old-fashioned
Scottish thrift, according to the old-fashioned Scottish manner. 
The younger children, crawling among the feet of the elder,
watched the progress of grannies spindle as it twisted, and now
and then ventured to interrupt its progress as it danced upon the
floor in those vagaries which the more regulated spinning-wheel
has now so universally superseded, that even the fated Princess
in the fairy tale might roam through all Scotland without the risk
of piercing her hand with a spindle, and dying of the wound. 
Late as the hour was (and it was long past midnight), the whole
family were still on foot, and far from proposing to go to bed;
the dame was still busy broiling car-cakes on the girdle, and
the elder girl, the half-naked mermaid elsewhere commemorated,
was preparing a pile of Findhorn haddocks (that is, haddocks
smoked with green wood), to be eaten along with these relishing
provisions.

  While they were thus employed, a slight tap at the door,
accompanied with the question, ``Are ye up yet, sirs?'' announced
a visitor. The answer, ``Ay, ay,---come your ways ben, hinny,''
occasioned the lifting of the latch, and Jenny Rintherout, the
female domestic of our Antiquary, made her appearance.

  ``Ay, ay,'' exclaimed the mistress of the family---``Hegh, sirs!
can this be you, Jenny?---a sight o' you's gude for sair een,
lass.''

  ``O woman, we've been sae ta'en up wi' Captain Hector's
wound up by, that I havena had my fit out ower the door this
fortnight; but he's better now, and auld Caxon sleeps in his
room in case he wanted onything. Sae, as soon as our auld
folk gaed to bed, I e'en snodded my head up a bit, and left the
house-door on the latch, in case onybody should be wanting in
or out while I was awa, and just cam down the gate to see an
there was ony cracks amang ye.''

  ``Ay, ay,'' answered Luckie Mucklebackit, ``I see you hae
gotten a' your braws on; ye're looking about for Steenie now---
but he's no at hame the night; and ye'll no do for Steenie, lass
---a feckless thing like you's no fit to mainteen a man.''

  ``Steenie will no do for me,'' retorted Jenny, with a toss of
her head that might have become a higher-born damsel; ``I
maun hae a man that can mainteen his wife.''

  ``Ou ay, hinny---thae's your landward and burrows-town
notions. My certie!---fisherwives ken better---they keep the
man, and keep the house, and keep the siller too, lass.''

  ``A wheen poor drudges ye are,'' answered the nymph of the
land to the nymph of the sea. ``As sune as the keel o' the
coble touches the sand, deil a bit mair will the lazy fisher loons
work, but the wives maun kilt their coats, and wade into the
surf to tak the fish ashore. And then the man casts aff the wat
and puts on the dry, and sits down wi' his pipe and his gill-stoup
ahint the ingle, like ony auld houdie, and neer a turn will he do
till the coble's afloat again! And the wife she maun get the scull
on her back, and awa wi' the fish to the next burrows-town, and
scauld and ban wi'ilka wife that will scauld and ban wi'her till it's
sauld---and that's the gait fisher-wives live, puir slaving bodies.''

  ``Slaves?---gae wa', lass!---ca' the head o' the house slaves?
little ye ken about it, lass. Show me a word my Saunders daur
speak, or a turn he daur do about the house, without it be just
to tak his meat, and his drink, and his diversion, like ony o'
the weans. He has mair sense than to ca' anything about the
bigging his ain, frae the rooftree down to a crackit trencher on
the bink. He kens weel eneugh wha feeds him, and cleeds him,
and keeps a' tight, thack and rape, when his coble is jowing
awa in the Firth, puir fallow. Na, na, lass!---them that sell the
goods guide the purse---them that guide the purse rule the house. 
Show me ane o' yer bits o' farmer-bodies that wad let their wife
drive the stock to the market, and ca' in the debts. Na, na.''

  ``Aweel, aweel, Maggie, ilka land has its ain lauch---But
where's Steenie the night, when a's come and gane? And
where's the gudeman?''<*>

* Note G. Gyneocracy.


  ``I hae putten the gudeman to his bed, for he was e'en sair
forfain; and Steenie's awa out about some barns-breaking wi'
the auld gaberlunzie, Edie Ochiltree: they'll be in sune, and ye
can sit doun.''

  ``Troth, gudewife'' (taking a seat), ``I haena that muckle
time to stop---but I maun tell ye about the news. Yell hae
heard o' the muckle kist o' gowd that Sir Arthur has fund
down by at St. Ruth?---He'll be grander than ever now---he'll
no can haud down his head to sneeze, for fear o' seeing his
shoon.''

  ``Ou ay---a' the country's heard o' that; but auld Edie says
that they ca' it ten times mair than ever was o't, and he saw
them howk it up. Od, it would be lang or a puir body that
needed it got sic a windfa'.''

  ``Na, that's sure eneugh.---And yell hae heard o' the
Countess o' Glenallan being dead and lying in state, and how
she's to be buried at St. Ruth's as this night fa's, wi' torch-light;
and a' the popist servants, and Ringan Aikwood, that's a
papist too, are to be there, and it will be the grandest show
ever was seen.''

  ``Troth, hinny,'' answered the Nereid, ``if they let naebody
but papists come there, it'll no be muckle o' a show in this
country, for the auld harlot, as honest Mr. Blattergowl ca's her,
has few that drink o' her cup o' enchantments in this corner
o' our chosen lands.---But what can ail them to bury the auld
carlin (a rudas wife she was) in the night-time?---I dare say our
gudemither will ken.''

  Here she exalted her voice, and exclaimed twice or thrice,
``Gudemither! gudemither!'' but, lost in the apathy of age
and deafness, the aged sibyl she addressed continued plying her
spindle without understanding the appeal made to her.

  ``Speak to your grandmither, Jenny---Od, I wad rather hail
the coble half a mile aff, and the nor-wast wind whistling again
in my teeth.''

  ``Grannie,'' said the little mermaid, in a voice to which the
old woman was better accustomed, ``minnie wants to ken what
for the Glenallan folk aye bury by candle-light in the ruing of
St. Ruth!''

  The old woman paused in the act of twirling the spindle,
turned round to the rest of the party, lifted her withered, trembling,
and clay-coloured band, raised up her ashen-hued and
wrinkled face, which the quick motion of two light-blue eyes
chiefly distinguished from the visage of a corpse, and, as if
catching at any touch of association with the living world,
answered, ``What gars the Glenallan family inter their dead
by torchlight, said the lassie?---Is there a Glenallan dead e'en
now?''

  ``We might be a' dead and buried too,'' said Maggie, ``for
onything ye wad ken about it;''---and then, raising her voice to
the stretch of her mother-in-law's comprehension, she added,

  ``It's the auld Countess, gudemither.''

  ``And is she ca'd hame then at last?'' said the old woman,
in a voice that seemed to be agitated with much more feeling
than belonged to her extreme old age, and the general indifference
and apathy of her manner---``is she then called to her last
account after her lang race o' pride and power?---O God, forgie
her!''

  ``But minnie was asking ye,'' resumed the lesser querist,
``what for the Glenallan family aye bury their dead by torch-light?''

  ``They hae aye dune sae,'' said the grandmother, ``since the
time the Great Earl fell in the sair battle o' the Harlaw, when
they say the coronach was cried in ae day from the mouth of the
Tay to the Buck of the Cabrach, that ye wad hae heard nae
other sound but that of lamentation for the great folks that
had fa'en fighting against Donald of the Isles. But the Great
Earl's mither was living---they were a doughty and a dour race,
the women o' the house o' Glenallan---and she wad hae nae
coronach cried for her son, but had him laid in the silence o'
midnight in his place o' rest, without either drinking the dirge,
or crying the lament. She said he had killed enow that day
he died, for the widows and daughters o' the Highlanders he
had slain to cry the coronach for them they had lost, and for
her son too; and sae she laid him in his gave wi' dry eyes,
and without a groan or a wail. And it was thought a proud
word o' the family, and they aye stickit by it---and the mair in
the latter times, because in the night-time they had mair
freedom to perform their popish ceremonies by darkness and
in secrecy than in the daylight---at least that was the case in
my time; they wad hae been disturbed in the day-time baith
by the law and the commons of Fairport---they may be owerlooked
now, as I have heard: the warlds changed---I whiles
hardly ken whether I am standing or sitting, or dead or living.''

  And looking round the fire, as if in a state of unconscious
uncertainty of which she complained, old Elspeth relapsed into
her habitual and mechanical occupation of twirling the spindle.

  ``Eh, sirs!'' said Jenny Rintherout, under her breath to her
gossip, ``it's awsome to hear your gudemither break out in that
gait---it's like the dead speaking to the living.''

  ``Ye're no that far wrang, lass; she minds naething o' what
passes the day---but set her on auld tales, and she can speak
like a prent buke. She kens mair about the Glenallan family
than maist folk---the gudeman's father was their fisher mony a
day. Ye maun ken the papists make a great point o' eating
fish---it's nae bad part o' their religion that, whatever the rest
is---I could aye sell the best o' fish at the best o' prices for the
Countess's ain table, grace be wi' her! especially on a Friday---
But see as our gudemither's hands and lips are ganging---now
it's working in her head like barm---she'll speak eneugh the
night. Whiles she'll no speak a word in a week, unless it be to
the bits o' bairns.''

  ``Hegh, Mrs. Mucklebackit, she's an awsome wife!'' said
Jenny in reply. ``D'ye think she's a'thegither right? Folk
say she downa gang to the kirk, or speak to the minister, and
that she was ance a papist but since her gudeman's been dead,
naebody kens what she is. D'ye think yoursell that she's no
uncanny?''

  ``Canny, ye silly tawpie! think ye ae auld wife's less canny
than anither? unless it be Alison Breck---I really couldna in
conscience swear for her; I have kent the boxes she set fill'd
wi' partans, when''------

  ``Whisht, whisht, Maggie,'' whispered Jenny---``your gudemither's
gaun to speak again.''

  ``Wasna there some ane o' ye said,'' asked the old sibyl, ``or
did I dream, or was it revealed to me, that Joscelind, Lady
Glenallan, is dead, an' buried this night?''

  ``Yes, gudemither,'' screamed the daughter-in-law, ``it's e'en
sae.''

  ``And e'en sae let it be,'' said old Elspeth; ``she's made
mony a sair heart in her day---ay, e'en her ain son's---is he
living yet?''

  ``Ay, he's living yet; but how lang he'll live---however,
dinna ye mind his coming and asking after you in the spring,
and leaving siller?''

  ``It may be sae, Magge---I dinna mind it---but a handsome
gentleman he was, and his father before him. Eh! if his father
had lived, they might hae been happy folk! But he was gane,
and the lady carried it in---ower and out-ower wi' her son, and
garr'd him trow the thing he never suld hae trowed, and do the
thing he has repented a' his life, and will repent still, were his
life as lang as this lang and wearisome ane o' mine.''

  ``O what was it, grannie?''---and ``What was it, gudemither?''
---and ``What was it, Luckie Elspeth?'' asked the children, the
mother, and the visitor, in one breath.

  ``Never ask what it was,'' answered the old sibyl, ``but pray
to God that ye arena left to the pride and wilfu'ness o' your ain
hearts: they may be as powerful in a cabin as in a castle---I can
bear a sad witness to that. O that weary and fearfu' night!
will it never gang out o' my auld head!---Eh! to see her lying
on the floor wi' her lang hair dreeping wi' the salt water!---
Heaven will avenge on a' that had to do wi't. Sirs! is my son
out wi' the coble this windy e'en?''

  ``Na, na, mither---nae coble can keep the sea this wind; he's
sleeping in his bed out-ower yonder ahint the hallan.''

  ``Is Steenie out at sea then?''

  ``Na, grannie---Steenie's awa out wi' auld Edie Ochiltree,
the gaberlunzie; maybe they'll be gaun to see the burial.''

  ``That canna be,'' said the mother of the family; ``we kent
naething o't till Jock Rand cam in, and tauld us the Aikwoods
had warning to attend---they keep thae things unco private---
and they were to bring the corpse a' the way frae the Castle,
ten miles off, under cloud o' night. She has lain in state this
ten days at Glenallan House, in a grand chamber a' hung wi'
black, and lighted wi' wax cannle.''

  ``God assoilzie her!'' ejaculated old Elspeth, her head apparently
still occupied by the event of the Countess's death;
``she was a hard-hearted woman, but she's gaen to account for
it a', and His mercy is infinite---God grant she may find it
sae!'' And she relapsed into silence, which she did not break
again during the rest of the evening.

  ``I wonder what that auld daft beggar carle and our son
Steenie can be doing out in sic a nicht as this,'' said Maggie
Mucklebackit; and her expression of surprise was echoed by her
visitor. ``Gang awa, ane o' ye, hinnies, up to the heugh head,
and gie them a cry in case they're within hearing; the car-cakes
will be burnt to a cinder.''

  The little emissary departed, but in a few minutes came
running back with the loud exclamation, ``Eh, Minnie! eh,
grannie! there's a white bogle chasing twa black anes down the
heugh.''

  A noise of footsteps followed this singular annunciation, and
young Steenie Mucklebackit, closely followed by Edie Ochiltree,
bounced into the hut. They were panting and out of breath. 
The first thing Steenie did was to look for the bar of the door,
which his mother reminded him had been broken up for fire-wood
in the hard winter three years ago; ``for what use,'' she
said, ``had the like o' them for bars?''

  ``There's naebody chasing us,'' said the beggar, after he had
taken his breath: ``we're e'en like the wicked, that flee when
no one pursueth.''

  ``Troth, but we were chased,'' said Steenie, ``by a spirit or
something little better.''

  ``It was a man in white on horseback,'' said Edie, ``for the
soft grund that wadna bear the beast, flung him about, I wot
that weel; but I didna think my auld legs could have brought
me aff as fast; I ran amaist as fast as if I had been at
Prestonpans.''<*>

* [This refers to the flight of the government forces at the battle of
* Prestonpans, 1745.]


  ``Hout, ye daft gowks!'' said Luckie Mucklebackit, ``it will
hae been some o' the riders at the Countess's burial.''

  ``What!'' said Edie, ``is the auld Countess buried the night at
St. Ruth's? Ou, that wad be the lights and the noise that
scarr'd us awa; I wish I had ken'd---I wad hae stude them,
and no left the man yonder---but they'll take care o' him. Ye
strike ower hard, Steenie I doubt ye foundered the chield.''

  ``Neer a bit,'' said Steenie, laughing; ``he has braw broad
shouthers, and I just took measure o' them wi' the stang. Od,
if I hadna been something short wi' him, he wad hae knockit
your auld hams out, lad.''

  ``Weel, an I win clear o' this scrape,'' said Edie, ``I'se tempt
Providence nae mair. But I canna think it an unlawfu' thing
to pit a bit trick on sic a landlouping scoundrel, that just lives
by tricking honester folk.''

  ``But what are we to do with this?'' said Steenie, producing
a pocket-book.

  ``Od guide us, man,'' said Edie in great alarm, ``what garr'd
ye touch the gear? a very leaf o' that pocket-book wad be eneugh
to hang us baith.''

  ``I dinna ken,'' said Steenie; ``the book had fa'en out o' his
pocket, I fancy, for I fand it amang my feet when I was graping
about to set him on his logs again, and I just pat it in my pouch
to keep it safe; and then came the tramp of horse, and you
cried, `Rin, rin,' and I had nae mair thought o' the book.''

  ``We maun get it back to the loon some gait or other; ye
had better take it yoursell, I think, wi' peep o' light, up to
Ringan Aikwood's. I wadna for a hundred pounds it was fund
in our hands.''

  Steenie undertook to do as he was directed.

  ``A bonny night ye hae made o't, Mr. Steenie,'' said Jenny
Rintherout, who, impatient of remaining so long unnoticed, now
presented herself to the young fisherman---``A bonny night ye
hae made o't, tramping about wi' gaberlunzies, and getting
yoursell hunted wi' worricows, when ye suld be sleeping in your
bed, like your father, honest man.''

  This attack called forth a suitable response of rustic raillery
from the young fisherman. An attack was now commenced
upon the car-cakes and smoked fish, and sustained with great
perseverance by assistance of a bicker or two of twopenny ale
and a bottle of gin. The mendicant then retired to the straw
of an out-house adjoining,---the children had one by one crept
into their nests,---the old grandmother was deposited in her
flock-bed,---Steenie, notwithstanding his preceding fatigue, had
the gallantry to accompany Miss Rintherout to her own mansion,
and at what hour he returned the story saith not,---and the
matron of the family, having laid the gathering-coal upon the
fire, and put things in some sort of order, retired to rest the last
of the family.
