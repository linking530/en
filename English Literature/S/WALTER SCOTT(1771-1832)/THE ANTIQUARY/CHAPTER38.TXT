	Well, well, at worst, 'tis neither theft nor coinage,
	Granting I knew all that you charge me with.
	What though the tomb hath borne a second birth,
	And given the wealth to one that knew not on't,
	Yet fair exchange was never robbery,
	Far less pure bounty------
					Old Play.

  The Antiquary, in order to avail himself of the permission
given him to question the accused party, chose rather to go to
the apartment in which Ochiltree was detained, than to make
the examination appear formal by bringing him again into the
magistrate's office. He found the old man seated by a window
which looked out on the sea; and as he gazed on that prospect,
large tears found their way, as if unconsciously, to his eye, and
from thence trickled down his cheeks and white beard. His
features were, nevertheless, calm and composed, and his whole
posture and mien indicated patience and resignation. Oldbuck
had approached him without being observed, and roused him
out of his musing by saying kindly, ``I am sorry, Edie, to see
you so much cast down about this matter.''

  The mendicant started, dried his eyes very hastily with the
sleeve of his gown, and endeavouring to recover his usual tone
of indifference and jocularity, answered, but with a voice more
tremulous than usual, ``I might weel hae judged, Monkbarns,
it was you, or the like o' you, was coming in to disturb me---
for it's ae great advantage o' prisons and courts o' justice, that
ye may greet your een out an ye like, and nane o' the folk
that's concerned about them will ever ask you what it's for.''

  ``Well, Edie,'' replied Oldbuck, ``I hope your present cause
of distress is not so bad but it may be removed.''

  ``And I had hoped, Monkbarns,'' answered the mendicant,
in a tone of reproach, ``that ye had ken'd me better than to
think that this bit trifling trouble o' my ain wad bring tears
into my auld een, that hae seen far different kind o' distress.
---Na, na!---But here's been the puir lass, Caxon's daughter,
seeking comfort, and has gotten unco little---there's been nae
speerings o' Taffril's gunbrig since the last gale; and folk report
on the key that a king's ship had struck on the Reef of Rattray,
and a' hands lost---God forbid! for as sure as you live,
Monkbarns, the puir lad Lovel, that ye liked sae weel, must
have perished.''

  ``God forbid indeed!'' echoed the Antiquary, turning pale---
``I would rather Monkbarns House were on fire. My poor dear
friend and coadjutor! I will down to the quay instantly.''

  ``I'm sure yell learn naething mair than I hae tauld ye, sir,''
said Ochiltree, ``for the officer-folk here were very civil (that
is, for the like o' them), and lookit up ae their letters and
authorities, and could throw nae light on't either ae way or
another.''

  ``It can't be true! it shall not be true!'' said the Antiquary,
``And I won't believe it if it were!---Taffril's an excellent sea
man, and Lovel (my poor Lovel!) has all the qualities of a
safe and pleasant companion by land or by sea---one, Edie,
whom, from the ingenuousness of his disposition, I would
choose, did I ever go a sea-voyage (which I never do, unless
across the ferry), _fragilem mecum solvere phaselum,_ to be the
companion of my risk, as one against whom the elements could
nourish no vengeance. No, Edie, it is not, and cannot be true
---it is a fiction of the idle jade Rumour, whom I wish hanged
with her trumpet about her neck, that serves only with its
screech-owl tones to fright honest folks out of their senses.---Let
me know how you got into this scrape of your own.''

  ``Are ye axing me as a magistrate, Monkbarns, or is it just
for your ain satisfaction!''

  ``For my own satisfaction solely,'' replied the Antiquaxy.

  ``Put up your pocket-book and your keelyvine pen then, for
I downa speak out an ye hae writing materials in your hands
---they're a scaur to unlearned folk like me---Od, ane o' the
clerks in the neist room will clink down, in black and white, as
muckle as wad hang a man, before ane kens what he's saying.''

  Monkbarns complied with the old man's humour, and put up
his memorandum-book.

  Edie then went with great frankness through the part of the
story already known to the reader, informing the Antiquary of
the scene which he had witnessed between Dousterswivel and
his patron in the ruins of St. Ruth, and frankly confessing that
he could not resist the opportunity of decoying the adept once
more to visit the tomb of Misticot, with the purpose of taking
a comic revenge upon him for his quackery. He had easily
persuaded Steenie, who was a bold thoughtless young fellow, to
engage in the frolic along with him, and the jest had been
inadvertently carried a great deal farther than was designed. 
Concerning the pocket-book, he explained that he had expressed
his surprise and sorrow as soon as he found it had been inadvertently
brought off : and that publicly, before all the inmates
of the cottage, Steenie had undertaken to return it the next day,
and had only been prevented by his untimely fate.

  The Antiquary pondered a moment, and then said, ``Your
account seems very probable, Edie, and I believe it from what
I know of the parties. But I think it likely that you know a
great deal more than you have thought it proper to tell me,
about this matter of the treasure trove---I suspect you have acted
the part of the Lar Familiaris in Plautus---a sort of Brownie,
Edie, to speak to your comprehension, who watched over hidden
treasures.---I do bethink me you were the first person we met
when Sir Arthur made his successful attack upon Misticot's
grave, and also that when the labourers began to flag, you, Edie.
were again the first to leap into the trench, and to make the
discovery of the treasure. Now you must explain an this to me,
unless you would have me use you as ill as Euclio does Staphyla
in the _Aulularia._''

  ``Lordsake, sir,'' replied the mendicant, ``what do I ken about
your Howlowlaria?---it's mair like a dog's language than a
man's.''

  ``You knew, however, of the box of treasure being there?''
continued Oldbuck.

  ``Dear sir,'' answered Edie, assuming a countenance of great
simplicity, ``what likelihood is there o'that? d'ye think sae puir
an auld creature as me wad hae kend o' sic a like thing without
getting some gude out o't?---and ye wot weel I sought nane and
gat nane, like Michael Scott's man. What concern could I hae
wi't?''

  ``That's just what I want you to explain to me,'' said Oldbuck;
``for I am positive you knew it was there.''

  ``Your honour's a positive man, Monkbarns---and, for a
positive man, I must needs allow ye're often in the right.''

  ``You allow, then, Edie, that my belief is well founded?''

  Edie nodded acquiescence.

  ``Then please to explain to me the whole affair from beginning
to end,'' said the Antiquary.

  ``If it were a secret o' mine, Monkbarns,'' replied the beggar,
``ye suldna ask twice; for I hae aye said ahint your back, that
for a' the nonsense maggots that ye whiles take into your head,
ye are the maist wise and discreet o' a' our country gentles. But
I'se een be open-hearted wi' you, and tell you that this is a
friend's secret, and that they suld draw me wi' wild horses, or
saw me asunder, as they did the children of Ammon, sooner
than I would speak a word mair about the matter, excepting
this, that there was nae ill intended, but muckle gude, and that
the purpose was to serve them that are worth twenty hundred
o' me. But there's nae law, I trow, that makes it a sin to ken
where ither folles siller is, if we didna pit hand til't oursell?''

  Oldbuck walked once or twice up and down the room in profound
thought, endeavouring to find some plausible reason for
transactions of a nature so mysterious---but his ingenuity
was totally at fault. He then placed himself before the
prisoner. 

  ``This story of yours, friend Edie, is an absolute enigma, and
would require a second <OE>dipus to solve it---who <OE>dipus was,
I will tell you some other time if you remind me---However,
whether it be owing to the wisdom or to the maggots with
which you compliment me, I am strongly disposed to believe
that you have spoken the truth, the rather that you have not
made any of those obtestations of the superior powers, which I
observe you and your comrades always make use of when you
mean to deceive folks.'' (Here Edie could not suppress a smile.)
``If, therefore, you will answer me one question, I will endeavour
to procure your liberation.''

  ``If yell let me hear the question,'' said Edie, with the caution
of a canny Scotchman, ``I'll tell you whether I'll answer it or
no.''

  ``It is simply,'' said the Antiquary, ``Did Dousterswivel
know anything about the concealment of the chest of bullion?''

  ``He, the ill-fa'ard loon!'' answered Edie, with much frankness
of manner---``there wad hae been little speerings o't had
Dustansnivel ken'd it was there---it wad hae been butter in the
black dog's hause.''

  ``I thought as much,'' said Oldbuck. ``Well, Edie, if I procure
your freedom, you must keep your day, and appear to clear
me of the bail-bond, for these are not times for prudent men to
incur forfeitures, unless you can point out another _Aulam auri
plenam quadrilibrem_---another _Search, No. I._''

  ``Ah!'' said the beggar, shaking his head, ``I doubt the
bird's flown that laid thae golden eggs---for I winna ca' her
goose, though that's the gait it stands in the story-buick---But
I'll keep my day, Monkbarns; ye'se no loss a penny by me---
And troth I wad fain be out again, now the weather's fine---
and then I hae the best chance o' hearing the first news o' my
friends.''

  ``Well, Edie, as the bouncing and thumping beneath has
somewhat ceased, I presume Bailie Littlejohn has dismissed his
military preceptor, and has retired from the labours of Mars to
those of Themis---I will have some conversation with him---But
I cannot and will not believe any of those wretched news you
were telling me.''

  ``God send your honour may be right!'' said the mendicant,
as Oldbuck left the room.

  The Antiquary found the magistrate, exhausted with the
fatigues of the drill, reposing in his gouty chair, humming the
air, ``How merrily we live that soldiers be!'' and between each
bar comforting himself with a spoonful of mock-turtle soup.
He ordered a similar refreshment for Oldbuck, who declined
it, observing, that, not being a military man, he did not feel inclined
to break his habit of keeping regular hours for meals---
``Soldiers like you, Bailie, must snatch their food as they find
means and time. But I am sorry to hear ill news of young
Taffril's brig.''

  ``Ah, poor fellow!'' said the bailie, ``he was a credit to the
town---much distinguished on the first of June.''

  ``But,'' said Oldbuck, ``I am shocked to hear you talk of
him in the preterite tense.''

  ``Troth, I fear there may be too much reason for it, Monkbarns;
---and yet let us hope the best. The accident is said to
have happened in the Rattray reef of rocks, about twenty miles
to the northward, near Dirtenalan Bay---I have sent to inquire
about it---and your nephew run out himself as if he had been
flying to get the Gazette of a victory.''

  Here Hector entered, exclaiming as he came in, ``I believe
it's all a damned lie---I can't find the least authority for it, but
general rumour.''

  ``And pray, Mr. Hector,'' said his uncle, ``if it had been true,
whose fault would it have been that Lovel was on board?''

  ``Not mine, I am sure,'' answered Hector; ``it would have
been only my misfortune.''

  ``Indeed!'' said his uncle, ``I should not have thought of
that.''

  ``Why, sir, with all your inclination to find me in the wrong,''
replied the young soldier, ``I suppose you will own my intention
was not to blame in this case. I did my best to hit Lovel, and
if I had been successful, 'tis clear my scrape would have been
his, and his scrape would have been mine.''

  ``And whom or what do you intend to hit now, that you are
lugging with you that leathern magazine there, marked Gunpowder?''

  ``I must be prepared for Lord Glenallan's moors on the
twelfth, sir,'' said M`Intyre.

  ``Ah, Hector! thy great _chasse,_ as the French call it, would
take place best---

	Omne cum Proteus pecus egit altos
	Visere montes ------

Could you meet but with a martial _phoca,_ instead of an unwarlike
heath-bird.''

  ``The devil take the seal, sir, or _phoca,_ if you choose to call
it so! It's rather hard one can never hear the end of a little
piece of folly like that.''

  ``Well, well,'' said Oldbuck, ``I am glad you have the grace
to be ashamed of it---as I detest the whole race of Nimrods, I
wish them all as well matched. Nay, never start off at a jest,
man---I have done with the _phoca_---though, I dare say, the
Bailie could tell us the value of seal-skins just now.''

  ``They are up,'' said the magistrate, ``they are well up---
the fishing has been unsuccessful lately.''

  ``We can bear witness to that,'' said the tormenting Antiquary,
who was delighted with the hank this incident had
given him over the young sportsman: One word more,
Hector, and

	We'll hang a seal-skin on thy recreant limbs.

Aha, my boy! Come, never mind it; I must go to business.---
Bailie, a word with you: you must take bail---moderate bail,
you understand---for old Ochiltree's appearance.''

  ``You don't consider what you ask,'' said the Bailie; ``the
offence is assault and robbery.''

  ``Hush! not a word about it,'' said the Antiquary. ``I gave
you a hint before---I will possess you more fully hereafter---I
promise you, there is a secret.''

  ``But, Mr. Oldbuck, if the state is concerned, I, who do the
whole drudgery business here, really have a title to be consulted,
and until I am''------

  ``Hush! hush!'' said the Antiquary, winking and putting
his finger to his nose,---``you shall have the full credit, the
entire management, whenever matters are ripe. But this is an
obstinate old fellow, who will not hear of two people being as
yet let into his mystery, and he has not fully acquainted me
with the clew to Dousterswivel's devices.''

  ``Aha! so we must tip that fellow the alien act, I suppose?''

  ``To say truth, I wish you would.''

  ``Say no more,'' said the magistrate; ``it shall forthwith be
done---he shall be removed _tanquam suspect_---I think that's
one of your own phrases, Monkbarns?''

  ``It is classical, Bailie---you improve.''

  ``Why, public business has of late pressed upon me so much,
that I have been obliged to take my foreman into partnership. 
I have had two several correspondences with the Under Secretary
of State---one on the proposed tax on Riga hemp-seed, and
the other on putting down political societies. So you might
as well communicate to me as much as you know of this old
fellow's discovery of a plot against the state.''

  ``I will, instantly, when I am master of it,'' replied Oldbuck
----``I hate the trouble of managing such matters myself. 
Remember, however, I did not say decidedly a plot against the
state I only say I hope to discover, by this man's means, a
foul plot.''

  ``If it be a plot at all, there must be treason in it, or sedition
at least,'' said the Bailie---``Will you bail him for four hundred
merks?''

  ``Four hundred merks for an old Blue-Gown! Think on
the act 1701 regulating bail-bonds!---Strike off a cipher from
the sum---I am content to bail him for forty merks.''

  ``Well, Mr. Oldbuck, everybody in Fairport is always willing
to oblige you---and besides, I know that you are a prudent man,
and one that would be as unwilling to lose forty, as four hundred
merks. So I will accept your bail, _meo periculo_---what say you
to that law phrase again? I had it from a learned counsel. I
will vouch it, my lord, he said, _meo periculo._''

  ``And I will vouch for Edie Ochiltree, _meo periculo,_ in like
manner,'' said Oldbuck. ``So let your clerk draw out the bail-bond,
and I will sign it.''

  When this ceremony had been performed, the Antiquary
communicated to Edie the joyful tidings that he was once more
at liberty, and directed him to make the best of his way to
Monkbarns House, to which he himself returned with his
nephew, after having perfected their good work.
