	If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
	My bosom's lord sits lightly on his throne,
	And all this day, an unaccustomed spirit
	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
						Romeo and Juliet.

  The account of Sir Arthur's unhappy adventure had led Oldbuck
somewhat aside from his purpose of catechising Lovel concerning
the cause of his residence at Fairport. He was now, however,
resolved to open the subject. ``Miss Wardour was formerly
known to you, she tells me, Mr. Lovel?''

  ``He had had the pleasure,'' Lovel answered, `to see her at
Mrs. Wilmot's, in Yorkshire.''

  ``Indeed! you never mentioned that to me before, and you
did not accost her as an old acquaintance.''

  ``I---I did not know,'' said Lovel, a good deal embarrassed,
``it was the same lady, till we met; and then it was my duty
to wait till she should recognise me.''

  ``I am aware of your delicacy: the knight's a punctilious old
fool, but I promise you his daughter is above all nonsensical
ceremony and prejudice. And now, since you have, found a
new set of friends here, may I ask if you intend to leave Fairport
as soon as you proposed?''

  ``What if I should answer your question by another,'' replied
Lovel, ``and ask you what is your opinion of dreams?''

  ``Of dreams, you foolish lad!---why, what should I think of
them but as the deceptions of imagination when reason drops
the reins? I know no difference betwixt them and the hallucinations
of madness---the unguided horses run away with the
carriage in both cases, only in the one the coachman is drunk,
and in the other he slumbers. What says our Marcus Tullius---
_Si insanorum visis fides non est habenda, cur credatur somnientium
visis, qu<ae> multo etiam perturbatiora sunt, non intelligo._''

  ``Yes, sir; but Cicero also tells us, that as he who passes the
whole day in darting the javelin must sometimes hit the mark,
so, amid the cloud of nightly dreams, some may occur consonant
to future events.''

  ``Ay---that is to say, _you_ have hit the mark in your own
sage opinion? Lord! Lord! how this world is given to folly!
Well, I will allow for once the Oneirocritical science---I will
give faith to the exposition of dreams, and say a Daniel hath
arisen to interpret them, if you can prove to me that that dream
of yours has pointed to a prudent line of conduct.''

  ``Tell me, then,'' answered Lovel, ``why when I was hesitating
whether to abandon an enterprise, which I have perhaps rashly
undertaken, I should last night dream I saw your ancestor
pointing to a motto which encouraged me to perseverance?---
why should I have thought of those words which I cannot
remember to have heard before, which are in a language unknown
to me, and which yet conveyed, when translated, a lesson which
I could so plainly apply to my own circumstances?''

  The Antiquary burst into a fit of laughing. ``Excuse me, my
young friend---but it is thus we silly mortals deceive ourselves,
and look out of doors for motives which originate in our own
wilful will. I think I can help out the cause of your vision. 
You were so abstracted in your contemplations yesterday after
dinner, as to pay little attention to the discourse between Sir
Arthur and me, until we fell upon the controversy concerning
the Piks, which terminated so abruptly;---but I remember
producing to Sir Arthur a book printed by my ancestor, and
making him observe the motto; your mind was bent elsewhere,
but your ear had mechanically received and retained the sounds,
and your busy fancy, stirred by Grizel's legend I presume, had
introduced this scrap of German into your dream. As for the
waking wisdom which seized on so frivolous a circumstance as
an apology for persevering in some course which it could find
no better reason to justify, it is exactly one of those juggling
tricks which the sagest of us play off now and then, to gratify
our inclination at the expense of our understanding.''

  ``I own it,'' said Lovel, blushing deeply;---``I believe you
are right, Mr. Oldbuck, and I ought to sink in your esteem for
attaching a moment's consequence to such a frivolity;---but I
was tossed by contradictory wishes and resolutions, and you
know how slight a line will tow a boat when afloat on the
billows, though a cable would hardly move her when pulled up
on the beach.''

  ``Right, right,'' exclaimed the Antiquary. ``Fall in my
opinion!---not a whit---I love thee the better, man;---why, we
have story for story against each other, and I can think with
less shame on having exposed myself about that cursed Pr<ae>torium
---though I am still convinced Agricola's camp must have
been somewhere in this neighbourhood. And now, Lovel, my
good lad, be sincere with me---What make you from Wittenberg?
---why have you left your own country and professional
pursuits, for an idle residence in such a place as Fairport? A
truant disposition, I fear.''

  ``Even so,'' replied Lovel, patiently submitting to an
interrogatory which he could not well evade. ``Yet I am
so detached from all the world, have so few in whom I am
interested, or who are interested in me, that my very state of
destitution gives me independence. He whose good or evil
fortune affects himself alone, has the best right to pursue it
according to his own fancy.''

  ``Pardon me, young man,'' said Oldbuck, laying his hand
kindly on his shoulder, and making a full halt---``_sufflamina_---
a little patience, if you please. I will suppose that you have
no friends to share or rejoice in your success in life---that you
cannot look back to those to whom you owe gratitude, or
forward to those to whom you ought to afford protection; but
it is no less incumbent on you to move steadily in the path of
duty---for your active exertions are due not only to society, but
in humble gratitude to the Being who made you a member of
it, with powers to serve yourself and others.''

  ``But I am unconscious of possessing such powers,'' said
Lovel, somewhat impatiently. ``I ask nothing of society but
the permission of walking innoxiously through the path of life,
without jostling others, or permitting myself to be jostled. I
owe no man anything---I have the means of maintaining,
myself with complete independence; and so moderate are my
wishes in this respect, that even these means, however limited,
rather exceed than fall short of them.''

  ``Nay, then,'' said Oldbuck, removing his hand, and turning
again to the road, ``if you are so true a philosopher as to think
you have money enough, there's no more to be said---I cannot
pretend to be entitled to advise you;---you have attained the
_acm<e'>_---the summit of perfection. And how came Fairport
to be the selected abode of so much self-denying philosophy?
It is as if a worshipper of the true religion had set up his
staff by choice among the multifarious idolaters of the land
of Egypt. There is not a man in Fairport who is not a
devoted worshipper of the Golden Calf---the mammon of unrighteousness.
 Why, even I, man, am so infected by the bad
neighbourhood, that I feel inclined occasionally to become an
idolater myself.''

  ``My principal amusements being literary,'' answered Lovel,
``and circumstances which I cannot mention having induced
me, for a time at least, to relinquish the military service, I have
pitched on Fairport as a place where I might follow my pursuits
without any of those temptations to society which a more elegant
circle might have presented to me.''

  ``Aha!'' replied Oldbuck, knowingly,---``I begin to understand
your application of my ancestor's motto. You are a
candidate for public favour, though not in the way I first
suspected,---you are ambitious to shine as a literary character,
and you hope to merit favour by labour and perseverance?''

  Lovel, who was rather closely pressed by the inquisitiveness
of the old gentleman, concluded it would be best to let him
remain in the error which he had gratuitously adopted.

  ``I have been at times foolish enough,'' he replied, ``to
nourish some thoughts of the kind.''

  ``Ah, poor fellow! nothing can be more melancholy; unless,
as young men sometimes do, you had fancied yourself in love
with some trumpery specimen of womankind, which is indeed,
as Shakspeare truly says, pressing to death, whipping, and
hanging all at once.''

  He then proceeded with inquiries, which he was sometimes
kind enough to answer himself. For this good old gentleman
had, from his antiquarian researches, acquired a delight in
building theories out of premises which were often far from
affording sufficient ground for them; and being, as the reader
must have remarked, sufficiently opinionative, he did not readily
brook being corrected, either in matter of fact or judgment,
even by those who were principally interested in the subjects
on which he speculated. He went on, therefore, chalking out
Lovel's literary career for him.

  ``And with what do you propose to commence your debut as
a man of letters?---But I guess---poetry---poetry---the soft
seducer of youth. Yes! there is an acknowledging modesty of
confusion in your eye and manner. And where lies your vein?
---are you inclined to soar to the, higher regions of Parnassus,
or to flutter around the base of the hill?''

  ``I have hitherto attempted only a few lyrical pieces,'' said
Lovel.

  ``Just as I supposed---pruning your wing, and hopping
from spray to spray. But I trust you intend a bolder flight. 
Observe, I would by no means recommend your persevering in
this unprofitable pursuit---but you say you are quite independent
of the public caprice?''

  ``Entirely so,'' replied Lovel.

  ``And that you are determined not to adopt a more active
course of life?''

  ``For the present, such is my resolution,'' replied the young
man.

  ``Why, then, it only remains for me to give you my best
advice and assistance in the object of your pursuit. I have
myself published two essays in the Antiquarian Repository,---
and therefore am an author of experience, There was my
Remarks on Hearne's edition of Robert of Gloucester, signed
_Scrutator;_ and the other signed _Indagator,_ upon a passage in
Tacitus. I might add, what attracted considerable notice at
the time, and that is my paper in the Gentleman's Magazine,
upon the inscription of <OE>lia Lelia, which I subscribed _<OE>dipus._ 
So you see I am not an apprentice in the mysteries of author-craft,
and must necessarily understand the taste and temper
of the times. And now, once more, what do you intend to
commence with?''

  ``I have no instant thoughts of publishing.''

  ``Ah! that will never do; you must have the fear of the
public before your eyes in all your undertakings. Let us see
now: A collection of fugitive pieces; but no---your fugitive
poetry is apt to become stationary with the bookseller. It
should be something at once solid and attractive---none of your
romances or anomalous novelties---I would have you take high
ground at once. Let me see: What think you of a real epic?
---the grand old-fashioned historical poem which moved through
twelve or twenty-four books. We'll have it so---I'll supply
you with a subject---The battle between the Caledonians and
Romans---The Caledoniad; or, Invasion Repelled;---let that be
the title---it will suit the present taste, and you may throw in
a touch of the times.''

  ``But the invasion of Agricola was _not_ repelled.''

  ``No; but you are a poet---free of the corporation, and as
little bound down to truth or probability as Virgil himself---
You may defeat the Romans in spite of Tacitus.''

  ``And pitch Agricola's camp at the Kaim of---what do you
call it,'' answered Lovel, ``in defiance of Edie Ochiltree?''

  ``No more of that, an thou lovest me---And yet, I dare say,
ye may unwittingly speak most correct truth in both instances,
in despite of the _toga_ of the historian and the blue gown of the
mendicant.''

  ``Gallantly counselled!---Well, I will do my best---your
kindness will assist me with local information.''

  ``Will I not, man?---why, I will write the critical and
historical notes on each canto, and draw out the plan of the
story myself. I pretend to some poetical genius, Mr. Lovel,
only I was never able to write verses.''

  ``It is a pity, sir, that you should have failed in a qualification
somewhat essential to the art.''

  ``Essential?---not a whit---it is the mere mechanical department.
A man may be a poet without measuring spondees and
dactyls like the ancients, or clashing the ends of lines into
rhyme like the moderns, as one may be an architect though
unable to labour like a stone-mason---Dost think Palladio or
Vitruvius ever carried a hod?''

  ``In that case, there should be two authors to each poem---
one to think and plan, another to execute.''

  ``Why, it would not be amiss; at any rate, we'll make the
experiment;---not that I would wish to give my name to the
public---assistance from a learned friend might be acknowledged
in the preface after what flourish your nature will---I am a total
stranger to authorial vanity.''

  Lovel was much entertained by a declaration not very consistent
with the eagerness wherewith his friend seemed to catch
at an opportunity of coming before the public, though in a
manner which rather resembled stepping up behind a carriage
than getting into one. The Antiquary was indeed uncommonly
delighted; for, like many other men who spend their lives in
obscure literary research, he had a secret ambition to appear
in print, which was checked by cold fits of diffidence, fear of
criticism, and habits of indolence and procrastination. ``But,''
thought he, ``I may, like a second Teucer, discharge my shafts
from behind the shield of my ally; and, admit that he should
not prove to be a first-rate poet, I am in no shape answerable
for his deficiencies, and the good notes may very probably help
off an indifferent text. But he is---he must be a good poet; he
has the real Parnassian abstraction---seldom answers a question
till it is twice repeated---drinks his tea scalding, and eats without
knowing what he is putting into his mouth. This is the
real _<ae>stus,_ the _awen_ of the Welsh bards, the _divinus afflatus_ that
transports the poet beyond the limits of sublunary things. His
visions, too, are very symptomatical of poetic fury---I must
recollect to send Caxon to see he puts out his candle to-night---
poets and visionaries are apt to be negligent in that respect.''
Then, turning to his companion, he expressed himself aloud in
continuation---

  ``Yes, my dear Lovel, you shall have full notes; and, indeed,
think we may introduce the whole of the Essay on Castrametation
into the appendix---it will give great value to the work. 
Then we will revive the good old forms so disgracefully neglected
in modern times. You shall invoke the Muse---and certainly
she ought to be propitious to an author who, in an apostatizing
age, adheres with the faith of Abdiel to the ancient form of
adoration.---Then we must have a vision---in which the Genius
of Caledonia shall appear to Galgacus, and show him a procession
of the real Scottish monarchs:---and in the notes I will have a
hit at Boethius---No; I must not touch that topic, now that
Sir Arthur is likely to have vexation enough besides---but I'll
annihilate Ossian, Macpherson, and Mac-Cribb.''

  ``But we must consider the expense of publication,'' said
Lovel, willing to try whether this hint would fall like cold
water on the blazing zeal of his self-elected coadjutor.

  ``Expense!'' said Mr. Oldbuck, pausing, and mechanically
fumbling in his pocket---``that is true;---I would wish to do
something---but you would not like to publish by subscription?''

  ``By no means,'' answered Lovel.

  ``No, no!'' gladly acquiesced the Antiquary---``it is not
respectable. I'll tell you what: I believe I know a bookseller
who has a value for my opinion, and will risk print and paper,
and I will get as many copies sold for you as I can.''

  ``O, I am no mercenary author,'' answered Lovel, smiling;
``I only wish to be out of risk of loss.''

  ``Hush! hush! we'll take care of that---throw it all on the
publishers. I do long to see your labours commenced. You
will choose blank verse, doubtless?---it is more grand and
magnificent for an historical subject; and, what concerneth
you, my friend, it is, I have an idea, more easily written.''

  This conversation brought them to Monkbarns, where the
Antiquary had to undergo a chiding from his sister, who, though
no philosopher, was waiting to deliver a lecture to him in the
portico. ``Guide us, Monkbarns! are things no dear eneugh
already, but ye maun be raising the very fish on us, by giving
that randy, Luckie Mucklebackit, just what she likes to ask?''

  ``Why, Grizel,'' said the sage, somewhat abashed at this
unexpected attack, ``I thought I made a very fair bargain.''

  ``A fair bargain! when ye gied the limmer a full half o'
what she seekit!---An ye will be a wife-carle, and buy fish at
your ain hands, ye suld never bid muckle mair than a quarter. 
And the impudent quean had the assurance to come up and
seek a dram---But I trow, Jenny and I sorted her!''

  ``Truly,'' said Oldbuck (with a sly look to his companion),
``I think our estate was gracious that kept us out of hearing
of that controversy.---Well, well, Grizel, I was wrong for once in
my life _ultra crepidam_---I fairly admit. But hang expenses!
---care killed a cat---we'll eat the fish, cost what it will.---And
then, Lovel, you must know I pressed you to stay here to-day,
the rather because our cheer will be better than usual, yesterday
having been a gaud<e'> day---I love the reversion of a feast better
than the feast itself. I delight in the _analecta,_ the _collectanea,_
as I may call them, of the preceding day's dinner, which appear
on such occasions---And see, there is Jenny going to ring the
dinner-bell.''
