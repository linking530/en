	Fortune, you say, flies from us---She but circles,
	Like the fleet sea-bird round the fowler's skiff,---
	Lost in the mist one moment, and the next
	Brushing the white sail with her whiter wing,
	As if to court the aim.---Experience watches,
	And has her on the wheel------
						Old Play.

  The shout of triumph in Hector's warlike tones was not easily
distinguished from that of battle. But as he rushed up stairs
with a packet in his hand, exclaiming, ``Long life to an old
soldier! here comes Edie with a whole budget of good news!''
it became obvious that his present cause of clamour was of an
agreeable nature. He delivered the letter to Oldbuck, shook Sir
Arthur heartily by the hand, and wished Miss Wardour joy, with
all the frankness of Highland congratulation. The messenger,
who had a kind of instinctive terror for Captain M`Intyre,
drew towards his prisoner, keeping an eye of caution on the
soldier's motions.

  ``Don't suppose I shall trouble myself about you, you dirty
fellow,'' said the soldier; ``there's a guinea for the fright I have
given you; and here comes an old _forty-two_ man, who is a fitter
match for you than I am.''

  The messenger (one of those dogs who are not too scornful
to eat dirty puddings) caught in his hand the guinea which
Hector chucked at his face; and abode warily and carefully
the turn which matters were now to take. All voices meanwhile
were loud in inquiries, which no one was in a hurry to
answer.

  ``What is the matter, Captain M`Intyre?'' said Sir Arthur.

  ``Ask old Edie,'' said Hector;---``I only know all's safe and
well.''

  ``What is all this, Edie?'' said Miss Wardour to the mendicant.

  ``Your leddyship maun ask Monkbarns, for he has gotten
the yepistolary correspondensh.''

  ``God save the king!'' exclaimed the Antiquary at the first
glance at the contents of his packet, and, surprised at once out
of decorum, philosophy, and phlegm, he skimmed his cocked
hat in the air, from which it descended not again, being caught
in its fall by a branch of the chandelier. He next, looking
joyously round, laid a grasp on his wig, which he perhaps
would have sent after the beaver, had not Edie stopped his
hand, exclaiming ``Lordsake! he's gaun gyte!---mind Caxon's
no here to repair the damage.''

  Every person now assailed the Antiquary, clamouring to know
the cause of so sudden a transport, when, somewhat ashamed
of his rapture, he fairly turned tail, like a fox at the cry of a
pack of hounds, and ascending the stair by two steps at a time,
gained the upper landing-place, where, turning round, he addressed
the astonished audience as follows:---

  ``My good friends, _favete linguis_---To give you information,
I must first, according to logicians, be possessed of it myself;
and, therefore, with your leaves, I will retire into the library to
examine these papers---Sir Arthur and Miss Wardour will have
the goodness to step into the parlour---Mr. Sweepclean, _secede
paulisper,_ or, in your own language, grant us a supersedere of
diligence for five minutes---Hector, draw off your forces, and
make your bear-garden flourish elsewhere---and, finally, be all
of good cheer till my return, which will be _instanter._''

  The contents of the packet were indeed so little expected,
that the Antiquary might be pardoned, first his ecstasy, and
next his desire of delaying to communicate the intelligence
they conveyed, until it was arranged and digested in his own
mind.

  Within the envelope was a letter addressed to Jonathan
Oldbuck, Esq. of Monkbarns, of the following purport:---

  ``Dear Sir,---To you, as my father's proved and valued friend,
I venture to address myself, being detained here by military
duty of a very pressing nature. You must by this time be
acquainted with the entangled state of our affairs; and I know
it will give you great pleasure to learn, that I am as fortunately
as unexpectedly placed in a situation to give effectual assistance
for extricating them. I understand Sir Arthur is threatened
with severe measures by persons who acted formerly as his
agents; and, by advice of a creditable man of business here, I
have procured the enclosed writing, which I understand will
stop their proceedings until their claim shall be legally discussed,
and brought down to its proper amount. I also enclose
bills to the amount of one thousand pounds to pay any other
pressing demands, and request of your friendship to apply them
according to your discretion. You will be surprised I give you
this trouble, when it would seem more natural to address my
father directly in his own affairs. But I have yet had no assurance
that his eyes are opened to the character of a person against
whom you have often, I know, warned him, and whose baneful
influence has been the occasion of these distresses. And as I
owe the means of relieving Sir Arthur to the generosity of a
matchless friend, it is my duty to take the most certain
measures for the supplies being devoted to the purpose for
which they were destined,---and I know your wisdom and kindness
will see that it is done. My friend, as he claims an interest
in your regard, will explain some views of his own in the enclosed
letter. The state of the post-office at Fairport being rather
notorious, I must send this letter to Tannonburgh; but the
old man Ochiltree, whom particular circumstances have recommended
as trustworthy, has information when the packet is
likely to reach that place, and will take care to forward it. I
expect to have soon an opportunity to apologize in person for
the trouble I now give, and have the honour to be your very
faithful servant,

				``Reginald Gamelyn Wardour.''
``Edinburgh, 6th August, 179---.''

  The Antiquary hastily broke the seal of the enclosure, the
contents of which gave him equal surprise and pleasure. When
he had in some measure composed himself after such unexpected
tidings, he inspected the other papers carefully, which all related
to business---put the bills into his pocket-book, and wrote a
short acknowledgment to be despatched by that day's post, for
he was extremely methodical in money matters---and lastly,
fraught with all the importance of disclosure, he descended to
the parlour.

  ``Sweepclean,'' said he, as he entered, to the officer who stood
respectfully at the door, ``you must sweep yourself clean out of
Knockwinnock Castle, with all your followers, tag-rag and bob-tail.
Seest thou this paper, man?''

  ``A sist on a bill o' suspension,'' said the messenger, with a
disappointed look;---``I thought it would be a queer thing if
ultimate diligence was to be done against sic a gentleman as Sir
Arthur---Weel, sir, I'se go my ways with my party---And who's
to pay my charges?''

  ``They who employed thee,'' replied Oldbuck, ``as thou full
well dost know.---But here comes another express: this is a day
of news, I think.''

  This was Mr. Mailsetter on his mare from Fairport, with a
letter for Sir Arthur, another to the messenger, both of which,
he said, he was directed to forward instantly. The messenger
opened his, observing that Greenhorn and Grinderson were good
enough men for his expenses, and here was a letter from them
desiring him to stop the diligence. Accordingly, he immediately
left the apartment, and staying no longer than to gather his
posse together, he did then, in the phrase of Hector, who
watched his departure as a jealous mastiff eyes the retreat of a
repulsed beggar, evacuate Flanders.

  Sir Arthur's letter was from Mr. Greenhorn, and a curiosity
in its way. We give it, with the worthy Baronet's comments.

  ``Sir---[Oh! I am _dear_ sir no longer; folks are only dear to
Messrs. Greenhorn and Grinderson when they are in adversity]
---Sir, I am much concerned to learn, on my return from the
country, where I was called on particular business [a bet on the
sweepstakes, I suppose], that my partner had the impropriety,
in my absence, to undertake the concerns of Messrs. Goldiebirds
in preference to yours, and had written to you in an unbecoming
manner. I beg to make my most humble apology, as well as
Mr. Grindersons---[come, I see he can write for himself and
partner too]---and trust it is impossible you can think me forgetful
of, or ungrateful for, the constant patronage which my
family [_his_ family! curse him for a puppy!] have uniformly
experienced from that of Knockwinnock. I am sorry to find,
from an interview I had this day with Mr. Wardour, that he
is much irritated, and, I must own, with apparent reason. But
in order to remedy as much as in me lies the mistake of which
he complains [pretty mistake, indeed! to clap his patron into
jail], I have sent this express to discharge all proceedings against
your person or property; and at the same time to transmit my
respectful apology. I have only to add, that Mr. Grinderson is
of opinion, that if restored to your confidence, he could point
out circumstances connected with Messrs. Goldiebirds' present
claim which would greatly reduce its amount [so, so, willing to
play the rogue on either side]; and that there is not the slightest
hurry in settling the balance of your accompt with us; and that
I am, for Mr. G. as well as myself, Dear Sir [O ay, he has written
himself into an approach to familiarity], your much obliged
and most humble servant,
				``Gilbert Greenhorn.''

  ``Well said, Mr. Gilbert Greenhorn,'' said Monkbarns; ``I
see now there is some use in having two attorneys in one firm. 
Their movements resemble those of the man and woman in a
Dutch baby-house. When it is fair weather with the client,
out comes the gentleman partner to fawn like a spaniel; when
it is foul, forth bolts the operative brother to pin like a bull-dog. 
Well, I thank God that my man of business still wears an equilateral
cocked hat, has a house in the Old Town, is as much
afraid of a horse as I am myself, plays at golf of a Saturday, goes
to the kirk of a Sunday, and, in respect he has no partner, hath
only his own folly to apologize for.''

  ``There are some writers very honest fellows,'' said Hector;
``I should like to hear any one say that my cousin, Donald
M`Intyre, Strathtudlem's seventh son (the other six are in the
army), is not as honest a fellow''------

  ``No doubt, no doubt, Hector, all the M`Intyres are so; they
have it by patent, man---But I was going to say, that in a profession
where unbounded trust is necessarily reposed, there is
nothing surprising that fools should neglect it in their idleness,
and tricksters abuse it in their knavery. But it is the more to
the honour of those (and I will vouch for many) who unite integrity
with skill and attention, and walk honourably upright
where there are so many pitfalls and stumbling-blocks for those
of a different character. To such men their fellow citizens may
safely entrust the care of protecting their patrimonial rights,
and their country the more sacred charge of her laws and privileges.''

  ``They are best aff, however, that hae least to do with them,''
said Ochiltree, who had stretched his neck into the parlour door;
for the general confusion of the family not having yet subsided,
the domestics, like waves after the fall of a hurricane, had not
yet exactly regained their due limits, but were roaming wildly
through the house.

  ``Aha, old Truepenny, art thou there?'' said the Antiquary.
``Sir Arthur, let me bring in the messenger of good luck, though
he is but a lame one. You talked of the raven that scented out
the slaughter from afar; but here's a blue pigeon (somewhat of
the oldest and toughest, I grant) who smelled the good news
six or seven miles off, flew thither in the taxed-cart, and returned
with the olive branch.''

  ``Ye owe it o' to puir Robie that drave me;---puir fallow,''
said the beggar, ``he doubts he's in disgrace wi' my leddy and
Sir Arthur.''

  Robert's repentant and bashful face was seen over the mendicant's
shoulder.

  ``In disgrace with me?'' said Sir Arthur---``how so?''---for
the irritation into which he had worked himself on occasion of
the toast had been long forgotten. ``O, I recollect---Robert, I
was angry, and you were wrong;---go about your work, and
never answer a master that speaks to you in a passion.''

  ``Nor any one else,'' said the Antiquary; ``for a soft answer
turneth away wrath.''

  ``And tell your mother, who is so ill with the rheumatism,
to come down to the housekeeper to-morrow,'' said Miss Wardour,
``and we will see what can be of service to her.''

  ``God bless your leddyship,'' said poor Robert, ``and his
honour Sir Arthur, and the young laird, and the house of
Knockwinnock in a' its branches, far and near!---it's been a kind
and gude house to the puir this mony hundred years.''

  ``There''---said the Antiquary to Sir Arthur---``we won't
dispute---but there you see the gratitude of the poor people
naturally turns to the civil virtues of your family. You don't
hear them talk of Redhand, or Hell-in-Harness. For me, I
must say, _Odi accipitrem qui semper vivit in armis_---so let us eat
and drink in peace, and be joyful, Sir Knight.''

  A table was quickly covered in the parlour, where the party
sat joyously down to some refreshment. At the request of
Oldbuck, Edie Ochiltree was permitted to sit by the sideboard
in a great leathern chair, which was placed in some measure
behind a screen.

  ``I accede to this the more readily,'' said Sir Arthur, ``because
I remember in my fathers days that chair was occupied by
Ailshie Gourlay, who, for aught I know, was the last privileged
fool, or jester, maintained by any family of distinction in Scotland.''

  ``Aweel, Sir Arthur,'' replied the beggar, who never hesitated
an instant between his friend and his jest, ``mony a wise man
sits in a fule's seat, and mony a fule in a wise man's, especially
in families o' distinction.''

  Miss Wardour, fearing the effect of this speech (however
worthy of Ailsbie Gourlay, or any other privileged jester) upon
the nerves of her father, hastened to inquire whether ale and
beef should not be distributed to the servants and people whom
the news had assembled round the Castle.

  ``Surely, my love,'' said her father; ``when was it ever otherwise
in our families when a siege had been raised?''

  ``Ay, a siege laid by Saunders Sweepclean the bailiff, and
raised by Edie Ochiltree the gaberlunzie, _par nobile fratrum,_''
said Oldbuck, ``and well pitted against each other in respectability.
But never mind, Sir Arthur---these are such sieges and
such reliefs as our time of day admits of---and our escape is not
less worth commemorating in a glass of this excellent wine---
Upon my credit, it is Burgundy, I think.''

  ``Were there anything better in the cellar,'' said Miss Wardour,
``it would be all too little to regale you after your friendly
exertions.''

  ``Say you so?'' said the Antiquary: ``why, then, a cup of
thanks to you, my fair enemy, and soon may you be besieged as
ladies love best to be, and sign terms of capitulation in the
chapel of Saint Winnox!''

  Miss Wardour blushed---Hector coloured, and then grew
pale.

  Sir Arthur answered, ``My daughter is much obliged to you,
Monkbarns; but unless you'll accept of her yourself, I really do
not know where a poor knight's daughter is to seek for an
alliance in these mercenary times.''

  ``Me, mean ye, Sir Arthur? No, not I! I will claim
privilege of the duello, and, as being unable to encounter my
fair enemy myself, I will appear by my champion---But of this
matter hereafter. What do you find in the papers there, Hector,
that you hold your head down over them as if your nose were
bleeding?''

  ``Nothing particular, sir; but only that, as my arm is now
almost quite well, I think I shall relieve you of my company in
a day or two, and go to Edinburgh. I see Major Neville is
arrived there. I should like to see him.''

  ``Major whom?'' said his uncle.

  ``Major Neville, sir,'' answered the young soldier.

  ``And who the devil is Major Neville?'' demanded the Antiquary.

  ``O, Mr. Oldbuck,'' said Sir Arthur, ``you must remember
his name frequently in the newspapers---a very distinguished
young officer indeed. But I am happy to say that Mr. M`Intyre
need not leave Monkbarns to see him, for my son writes that
the Major is to come with him to Knockwinnock, and I need
not say how happy I shall be to make the young gentlemen
acquainted,---unless, indeed, they are known to each other
already.''

  ``No, not personally,'' answered Hector, ``but I have had
occasion to hear a good deal of him, and we have several mutual
friends---your son being one of them. But I must go to Edinburgh;
for I see my uncle is beginning to grow tired of me, and
I am afraid''------

  ``That you will grow tired of him?'' interrupted Oldbuck,---
``I fear that's past praying for. But you have forgotten that
the ecstatic twelfth of August approaches, and that you are
engaged to meet one of Lord Glenallan's gamekeepers, God
knows where, to persecute the peaceful feathered creation.''

  ``True, true, uncle---I had forgot that,'' exclaimed the volatile
Hector; ``but you said something just now that put everything
out of my head.''

  ``An it like your honours,'' said old Edie, thrusting his
white bead from behind the screen, where he had been plentifully
regaling himself with ale and cold meat---``an it like your
honours, I can tell ye something that will keep the Captain wi'
us amaist as weel as the pouting---Hear ye na the French are
coming?''

  ``The French, you blockhead?'' answered Oldbuck---``Bah!''

  ``I have not had time,'' said Sir Arthur Wardour, ``to look
over my lieutenancy correspondence for the week---indeed, I
generally make a rule to read it only on Wednesdays, except in
pressing cases,---for I do everything by method; but from the
glance I took of my letters, I observed some alarm was entertained.''

  ``Alarm?'' said Edie, ``troth there's alarm, for the provost's
gar'd the beacon light on the Halket-head be sorted up (that
suld hae been sorted half a year syne) in an unco hurry, and the
council hae named nae less a man than auld Caxon himsell to
watch the light. Some say it was out o' compliment to Lieutenant
Taffril,---for it's neist to certain that he'll marry Jenny
Caxon,---some say it's to please your honour and Monkbarns that
wear wigs---and some say there's some auld story about a periwig
that ane o' the bailies got and neer paid for---Onyway, there he
is, sitting cockit up like a skart upon the tap o' the craig, to
skirl when foul weather comes.''

  ``On mine honour, a pretty warder,'' said Monkbarns; ``and
what's my wig to do all the while?''

  ``I asked Caxon that very question,'' answered Ochiltree,
``and he said he could look in ilka morning, and gie't a touch
afore he gaed to his bed, for there's another man to watch in
the day-time, and Caxon says he'll friz your honour's wig as
weel sleeping as wauking.''

  This news gave a different turn to the conversation, which
ran upon national defence, and the duty of fighting for the land
we live in, until it was time to part. The Antiquary and his
nephew resumed their walk homeward, after parting from
Knockwinnock with the warmest expressions of mutual regard,
and an agreement to meet again as soon as possible.
