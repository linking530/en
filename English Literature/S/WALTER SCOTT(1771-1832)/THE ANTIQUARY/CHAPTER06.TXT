	_Moth._ By Woden, God of Saxons,
	From whence comes Wensday, that is, Wednesday,
	Truth is a thing that I will ever keep
	Unto thylke day in which I creep into
	My sepulcre------
				Cartwright's _Ordinary._

  Our young friend Lovel, who had received a corresponding invitation,
punctual to the hour of appointment, arrived at
Monkbarns about five minutes before four o'clock on the 17th
of July. The day had been remarkably sultry, and large drops
of rain had occasionally fallen, though the threatened showers
had as yet passed away.

  Mr. Oldbuck received him at the Palmer's-port in his complete
brown suit, grey silk stockings, and wig powdered with
all the skill of the veteran Caxon, who having smelt out the
dinner, had taken care not to finish his job till the hour of eating
approached.

  ``You are welcome to my symposion, Mr. Lovel. And now
let me introduce you to my Clogdogdo's, as Tom Otter calls
them---my unlucky and good-for-nothing womankind---_mal<ae>
besti<ae>,_ Mr. Lovel.''

  ``I shall be disappointed, sir, if I do not find the ladies very
undeserving of your satire.''

  ``Tilley-valley, Mr. Lovel,---which, by the way, one commentator
derives from _tittivillitium,_ and another from _talley-ho_---
but tilley-valley, I say---a truce with your politeness. You will
find them but samples of womankind---But here they be, Mr.
Lovel. I present to you in due order, my most discreet sister
Griselda, who disdains the simplicity, as well as patience annexed
to the poor old name of Grizzel; and my most exquisite niece
Maria, whose mother was called Mary, and sometimes Molly.

  The elderly lady rustled in silks and satins, and bore upon
her head a structure resembling the fashion in the ladies'
memorandum-book for the year 1770---a superb piece of
architecture, not much less than a modern Gothic castle, of
which the curls might represent the turrets, the black pins the
_chevaux de frise,_ and the lappets the banners.

  The face, which, like that of the ancient statues of Vesta,
was thus crowned with towers, was large and long, and peaked
at nose and chin, and bore, in other respects, such a ludicrous
resemblance to the physiognomy of Mr. Jonathan Oldbuck, that
Lovel, had they not appeared at once, like Sebastian and Viola
in the last scene of the ``Twelfth Night,'' might have supposed
that the figure before him was his old friend masquerading in
female attire. An antique flowered silk gown graced the
extraordinary person to whom belonged this unparalleled _t<e^>te,_
which her brother was wont to say was fitter for a turban for
Mahound or Termagant, than a head-gear for a reasonable
creature, or Christian gentlewoman. Two long and bony arms
were terminated at the elbows by triple blond ruffles, and
being, folded saltire-ways in front of her person, and decorated
with long gloves of a bright vermilion colour, presented no bad
resemblance to a pair of gigantic lobsters. High-heeled shoes,
and a short silk cloak, thrown in easy negligence over her
shoulders, completed the exterior of Miss Griselda Oldbuck.

  Her niece, the same whom Lovel had seen transiently during
his first visit, was a pretty young woman, genteelly dressed
according to the fashion of the day, with an air of _espi<e`>glerie_
which became her very well, and which was perhaps derived
from the caustic humour peculiar to her uncle's family, though
softened by transmission.

  Mr. Lovel paid his respects to both ladies, and was answered
by the elder with the prolonged courtesy of 1760, drawn from
the righteous period,

	When folks conceived a grace
	Of half an hour's space,
	    And rejoiced in a Friday's capon,

and by the younger with a modern reverence, which, like the
festive benediction of a modern divine, was of much shorter
duration.

  While this salutation was exchanging, Sir Arthur, with his
fair daughter hanging upon his arm, having dismissed his
chariot, appeared at the garden door, and in all due form paid
his respects to the ladies.

  ``Sir Arthur,'' said the Antiquary, ``and you, my fair foe,
let me make known to you my young friend Mr. Lovel, a
gentleman who, during the scarlet-fever which is epidemic at
present in this our island, has the virtue and decency to appear
in a coat of a civil complexion. You see, however, that the
fashionable colour has mustered in his cheeks which appears
not in his garments. Sir Arthur, let me present to you a young
gentleman, whom your farther knowledge will find grave, wise,
courtly, and scholar-like, well seen, deeply read, and thoroughly
grounded in all the hidden mysteries of the green-room and
stage, from the days of Davie Lindsay down to those of Dibdin
---he blushes again, which is a sign of grace.''

  ``My brother,'' said Miss Griselda, addressing Lovel, ``has a
humorous way of expressing himself, sir; nobody thinks anything
of what Monkbarns says---so I beg you will not be so
confused for the matter of his nonsense; but you must have
had a warm walk beneath this broiling sun---would you take
anything?---a glass of balm-wine?''

  Ere Lovel could answer, the Antiquary interposed. ``Aroint
thee, witch! wouldst thou poison my guests with thy infernal
decoctions? Dost thou not remember how it fared with the
clergyman whom you seduced to partake of that deceitful
beverage?''

  ``O fy, fy, brother!---Sir Arthur, did you ever hear the like?
---he must have everything his ain way, or he will invent such
stories---But there goes Jenny to ring the old bell to tell us
that the dinner is ready.''

  Rigid in his economy, Mr. Oldbuck kept no male servant. 
This he disguised under the pretext that the masculine sex was
too noble to be employed in those acts of personal servitude,
which, in all early periods of society, were uniformly imposed
on the female. ``Why,'' would he say, ``did the boy, Tam
Rintherout, whom, at my wise sister's instigation, I, with equal
wisdom, took upon trial---why did he pilfer apples, take birds'
nests, break glasses, and ultimately steal my spectacles, except
that he felt that noble emulation which swells in the bosom of
the masculine sex, which has conducted him to Flanders with
a musket on his shoulder, and doubtless will promote him to a
glorious halbert, or even to the gallows? And why does this
girl, his full sister, Jenny Rintherout, move in the same vocation
with safe and noiseless step---shod, or unshod---soft as the pace
of a cat, and docile as a spaniel---Why? but because she is in
her vocation. Let them minister to us, Sir Arthur,---let them
minister, I say,---it's the only thing they are fit for. All
ancient legislators, from Lycurgus to Mahommed, corruptly
called Mahomet, agree in putting them in their proper and
subordinate rank, and it is only the crazy heads of our old
chivalrous ancestors that erected their Dulcineas into despotic
princesses.''

  Miss Wardour protested loudly against this ungallant doctrine;
but the bell now rung for dinner.

  ``Let me do all the offices of fair courtesy to so fair an
antagonist,'' said the old gentleman, offering his arm. ``I
remember, Miss Wardour, Mahommed (vulgarly Mahomet) had
some hesitation about the mode of summoning his Moslemah to
prayer. He rejected bells as used by Christians, trumpets as
the summons of the Guebres, and finally adopted the human
voice. I have had equal doubt concerning my dinner-call. 
Gongs, now in present use, seemed a newfangled and heathenish
invention, and the voice of the female womankind I rejected as
equally shrill and dissonant; wherefore, contrary to the said
Mahommed, or Mahomet, I have resumed the bell. It has a
local propriety, since it was the conventual signal for spreading
the repast in their refectory, and it has the advantage over
the tongue of my sister's prime minister, Jenny, that, though
not quite so loud and shrill, it ceases ringing the instant you
drop the bell-rope: whereas we know, by sad experience, that
any attempt to silence Jenny, only wakes the sympathetic
chime of Miss Oldbuck and Mary M`Intyre to join in chorus.''

  With this discourse he led the way to his dining-parlour,
which Lovel had not yet seen;---it was wainscotted, and contained
some curious paintings. The dining-table was attended
by Jenny; but an old superintendent, a sort of female butler,
stood by the sideboard, and underwent the burden of bearing
several reproofs from Mr. Oldbuck, and inuendos, not so much
marked, but not less cutting, from his sister.

  The dinner was such as suited a professed antiquary, comprehending
many savoury specimens of Scottish viands, now
disused at the tables of those who affect elegance. There was
the relishing Solan goose, whose smell is so powerful that he is
never cooked within doors. Blood-raw he proved to be on this
occasion, so that Oldbuck half threatened to throw the greasy
sea-fowl at the head of the negligent housekeeper, who acted
as priestess in presenting this odoriferous offering. But, by
good-hap, she had been most fortunate in the hotch-potch,
which was unanimously pronounced to be inimitable. ``I knew
we should succeed here,'' said Oldbuck exultingly, ``for Davie
Dibble, the gardener (an old bachelor like myself), takes care
the rascally women do not dishonour our vegetables. And here
is fish and sauce, and crappit-heads---I acknowledge our womankind
excel in that dish---it procures them the pleasure of
scolding, for half an hour at least, twice a-week, with auld
Maggy Mucklebackit, our fish-wife. The chicken-pie, Mr.
Lovel, is made after a recipe bequeathed to me by my departed
grandmother of happy memory---And if you will venture on a
glass of wine, you will find it worthy of one who professes the
maxim of King Alphonso of Castile,---Old wood to burn---old
books to read---old wine to drink---and old friends, Sir Arthur
---ay, Mr. Lovel, and young friends too, to converse with.''

  ``And what news do you bring us from Edinburgh, Monkbarns?''
said Sir Arthur; ``how wags the world in Auld
Reekie?''

  ``Mad, Sir Arthur, mad---irretrievably frantic---far beyond
dipping in the sea, shaving the crown, or drinking hellebore. 
The worst sort of frenzy, a military frenzy, hath possessed man,
woman, and child.''

  ``And high time, I think,'' said Miss Wardour, ``when we
are threatened with invasion from abroad and insurrection at
home.''

  ``O, I did not doubt you would join the scarlet host against
me---women, like turkeys, are always subdued by a red rag---
But what says Sir Arthur, whose dreams are of standing armies
and German oppression?''

  ``Why, I say, Mr. Oldbuck,'' replied the knight, ``that so
far as I am capable of judging, we ought to resist _cum toto
corpore regni_---as the phrase is, unless I have altogether
forgotten my Latin---an enemy who comes to propose to us a
Whiggish sort of government, a republican system, and who is
aided and abetted by a sort of fanatics of the worst kind in our
own bowels. I have taken some measures, I assure you, such
as become my rank in the community; for I have directed the
constables to take up that old scoundrelly beggar, Edie Ochiltree,
for spreading disaffection against church and state through the
whole parish. He said plainly to old Caxon, that Willie Howie's
Kilmarnock cowl covered more sense than all the three wigs in
the parish---I think it is easy to make out that inuendo---But
the rogue shall be taught better manners.''

  ``O no, my dear sir,'' exclaimed Miss Wardour, ``not old
Edie, that we have known so long;---I assure you no constable
shall have my good graces that executes such a warrant.''

  ``Ay, there it goes,'' said the Antiquary; ``you, to be a
staunch Tory, Sir Arthur, have nourished a fine sprig of
Whiggery in your bosom---Why, Miss Wardour is alone sufficient
to control a whole quarter-session---a quarter-session? ay,
a general assembly or convocation to boot---a Boadicea she---an
Amazon, a Zenobia.''

  ``And yet, with all my courage, Mr. Oldbuck, I am glad to
hear our people are getting under arms.''

  ``Under arms, Lord love thee! didst thou ever read the
history of Sister Margaret, which flowed from a head, that,
though now old and somedele grey, has more sense and political
intelligence than you find now-a-days in the whole synod? Dost
thou remember the Nurse's dream in that exquisite work, which
she recounts in such agony to Hubble Bubble?---When she
would have taken up a piece of broad-cloth in her vision, lo!
it exploded like a great iron cannon; when she put out her
hand to save a pirn, it perked up in her face in the form of a
pistol. My own vision in Edinburgh has been something
similar. I called to consult my lawyer; he was clothed in a
dragoon's dress, belted and casqued, and about to mount a
charger, which his writing-clerk (habited as a sharp-shooter)
walked to and fro before his door. I went to scold my agent
for having sent me to advise with a madman; he had stuck
into his head the plume, which in more sober days he wielded
between his fingers, and figured as an artillery officer. My
mercer had his spontoon in his hand, as if he measured his
cloth by that implement, instead of a legitimate yard. The,
banker's clerk, who was directed to sum my cash-account,
blundered it three times, being disordered by the recollection
of his military _tellings-off_ at the morning-drill. I was ill, and
sent for a surgeon---

	He came---but valour so had fired his eye,
	And such a falchion glittered on his thigh,
	That, by the gods, with such a load of steel,
	I thought he came to murder,---not to heal.

I had recourse to a physician, but he also was practising a more
wholesale mode of slaughter than that which his profession
had been supposed at all times to open to him. And now,
since I have returned here, even our wise neighbours of Fairport
have caught the same valiant humour. I hate a gun like a
hurt wild duck---I detest a drum like a quaker;---and they
thunder and rattle out yonder upon the town's common, so that
every volley and roll goes to my very heart.''

  ``Dear brother, dinna speak that gate o' the gentlemen
volunteers---I am sure they have a most becoming uniform---
Weel I wot they have been wet to the very skin twice last week
---I met them marching in terribly doukit, an mony a sair hoast
was amang them---And the trouble they take, I am sure it claims
our gratitude.''

  ``And I am sure,'' said Miss M`Intyre, ``that my uncle sent
twenty guineas to help out their equipments.''

  ``It was to buy liquorice and sugar-candy,'' said the cynic,
``to encourage the trade of the place, and to refresh the throats
of the officers who had bawled themselves hoarse in the service
of their country.''

  ``Take care, Monkbarns! we shall set you down among the
black-nebs by and by.''

  ``No Sir Arthur---a tame grumbler I. I only claim the
privilege of croaking in my own corner here, without uniting
my throat to the grand chorus of the marsh---_Ni quito Rey, ni
pongo Rey_---I neither make king nor mar king, as Sancho
says, but pray heartily for our own sovereign, pay scot and lot,
and grumble at the exciseman---But here comes the ewe-milk
cheese in good time; it is a better digestive than politics.''

  When dinner was over, and the decanters placed on the
table, Mr. Oldbuck proposed the King's health in a bumper,
which was readily acceded to both by Lovel and the Baronet,
the Jacobitism of the latter being now a sort of speculative
opinion merely,---the shadow of a shade.

  After the ladies had left the apartment, the landlord and Sir
Arthur entered into several exquisite discussions, in which the
younger guest, either on account of the abstruse erudition which
they involved, or for some other reason, took but a slender share,
till at length he was suddenly started out of a profound reverie
by an unexpected appeal to his judgment.

  ``I will stand by what Mr. Lovel says; he was born in the
north of England, and may know the very spot.''

  Sir Arthur thought it unlikely that so young a gentleman
should have paid much attention to matters of that sort.

  ``I am avised of the contrary,'' said Oldbuck.

  ``How say you, Mr. Lovel?---speak up for your own credit,
man.''

  Lovel was obliged to confess himself in the ridiculous situation
of one alike ignorant of the subject of conversation and controversy
which had engaged the company for an hour.

  ``Lord help the lad, his head has been wool-gathering!---
I thought how it would be when the womankind were admitted
---no getting a word of sense out of a young fellow for six
hours after.---Why, man, there was once a people called the
Piks''------

  ``More properly _Picts,_'' interrupted the Baronet.

  ``I say the _Pikar, Pihar, Piochtar, Piaghter,_ or _Peughtar,_"
vociferated Oldbuck; ``they spoke a Gothic dialect''------

  ``Genuine Celtic,'' again asseverated the knight.

  ``Gothic! Gothic! I'll go to death upon it!'' counter-asseverated
the squire.

  ``Why, gentlemen,'' sad Lovel, ``I conceive that is a dispute
which may be easily settled by philologists, if there are any
remains of the language.''

  ``There is but one word,'' said the Baronet, ``but, in spite of
Mr. Oldbuck's pertinacity, it is decisive of the question.''

  ``Yes, in my favour,'' said Oldbuck: ``Mr. Lovel, you shall
be judge---I have the learned Pinkerton on my side.''

  ``I, on mine, the indefatigable and erudite Chalmers.''

  ``Gordon comes into my opinion.''

  ``Sir Robert Sibbald holds mine.''

  ``Innes is with me!'' vociferated Oldbuck.

  ``Riston has no doubt!'' shouted the Baronet.

  ``Truly, gentlemen,'' said Lovel, ``before you muster your
forces and overwhelm me with authorities, I should like to know
the word in dispute.''

  ``_Benval_'' said both the disputants at once.

  ``Which signifies _caput valli,_" said Sir Arthur.

  ``The head of the wall,'' echoed Oldbuck.

  There was a deep pause.---``It is rather a narrow foundation
to build a hypothesis upon,'' observed the arbiter.

  ``Not a whit, not a whit,'' said Oldbuck; ``men fight best in
a narrow ring---an inch is as good as a mile for a home-thrust.''

  ``It is decidedly Celtic,'' said the Baronet; ``every hill in the
Highlands begins with _Ben._''

  ``But what say you to _Val,_ Sir Arthur; is it not decidedly
the Saxon _wall?_''

  ``It is the Roman _vallum,_'' said Sir Arthur; ---``the Picts
borrowed that part of the word.''

  ``No such thing; if they borrowed anything, it must have
been your _Ben,_ which they might have from the neighbouring
Britons of Strath Cluyd.''

  ``The Piks, or Picts,'' said Lovel, ``must have been singularly
poor in dialect, since, in the only remaining word of their
vocabulary, and that consisting only of two syllables, they have
been confessedly obliged to borrow one of them from another
language; and, methinks, gentlemen, with submission, the
controversy is not unlike that which the two knights fought,
concerning the shield that had one side white and the other
black. Each of you claim one-half of the word, and seem to
resign the other. But what strikes me most, is the poverty of
the language which has left such slight vestiges behind it.''

  ``You are in an error,'' said Sir Arthur; ``it was a copious
language, and they were a great and powerful people; built
two steeples---one at Brechin, one at Abernethy. The Pictish
maidens of the blood-royal were kept in Edinburgh Castle, thence
called _Castrum Puellarum._''

  ``A childish legend,'' said Oldbuck, ``invented to give consequence
to trumpery womankind. It was called the Maiden Castle,
_quasi lucus a non lucendo,_ because it resisted every attack, and
women never do.''

  ``There is a list of the Pictish kings,'' persisted Sir Arthur,
``well authenticated from Crentheminachcryme (the, date of
whose reign is somewhat uncertain) down to Drusterstone,
whose death concluded their dynasty. Half of them have the
Celtic patronymic _Mac_ prefixed---Mac, _id est filius;_---what do
you say to that, Mr. Oldbuck? There is Drust Macmorachin,
Trynel Maclachlin (first of that ancient clan, as it may be
judged), and Gormach Macdonald, Alpin Macmetegus, Drust
Mactallargam'' (here he was interrupted by a fit of coughing)
---``ugh, ugh, ugh---Golarge Macchan---ugh, ugh---Macchanan
---ugh---Macchananail, Kenneth---ugh---ugh---Macferedith,
Eachan Macfungus---and twenty more, decidedly Celtic names,
which I could repeat, if this damned cough would let me.''

  ``Take a glass of wine, Sir Arthur, and drink down that
bead-roll of unbaptized jargon, that would choke the devil---
why, that last fellow has the only intelligible name you have
repeated---they are all of the tribe of Macfungus---mushroom
monarchs every one of them; sprung up from the fumes of
conceit, folly, and falsehood, fermenting in the brains of some
mad Highland seannachie.''

  ``I am surprised to hear you, Mr. Oldbuck: you know, or
ought to know, that the list of these potentates was copied by
Henry Maule of Melguin, from the Chronicles of Loch Leven
and St. Andrews, and put forth by him in his short but satisfactory
history of the Picts, printed by Robert Freebairn of
Edinburgh, and sold by him at his shop in the Parliament
Close, in the, year of God seventeen hundred and five, or six, I
am not precisely certain which---but I have a copy at home that
stands next to my twelvemo copy of the Scots Acts, and ranges
on the shelf with them very well. What say you to that, Mr.
Oldbuck?''

  ``Say?---why, I laugh at Harry Maule and his history,''
answered Oldbuck, ``and thereby comply with his request, of
giving it entertainment according to its merits.''

  ``Do not laugh at a better man than yourself,'' said Sir Arthur,
somewhat scornfully.

  ``I do not conceive I do, Sir Arthur, in laughing either at
him or his history,''

  ``Henry Maule of Melgum was a gentleman, Mr. Oldbuck.''

  ``I presume he had no advantage of me in _that_ particular,''
replied the Antiquary, somewhat tartly.

  ``Permit me, Mr. Oldbuck---he was a gentleman of high
family, and ancient descent, and therefore''------

  ``The descendant of a Westphalian printer should speak of him
with deference? Such may be your opinion, Sir Arthur---it is
not mine. I conceive that my descent from that painful and
industrious typographer, Wolfbrand Oldenbuck, who, in the
month of December 1193, under the patronage, as the colophon
tells us, of Sebaldus Scheyter and Sebastian Kammermaister,
accomplished the printing of the great Chronicle of Nuremberg
---I conceive, I say, that my descent from that great restorer of
learning is more creditable to me as a man of letters, than if I
had numbered in my genealogy all the brawling, bullet-headed,
iron-fisted, old Gothic barons since the days of Crentheminachcryme---
not one of whom, I suppose, could write his own
name.''

  ``If you mean the observation as a sneer at my ancestry,''
said the knight, with an assumption of dignified superiority and
composure, ``I have the pleasure to inform you, that the name
of my ancestor, Gamelyn de Guardover, Miles, is written fairly
with his own hand in the earliest copy of the Ragman-roll.''

  ``Which only serves to show that he was one of the earliest
who set the mean example of submitting to Edward I. What
have, you to say for the stainless loyalty of your family, Sir
Arthur, after such a backsliding as that?''

  ``It's enough, sir,'' said Sir Arthur, starting up fiercely, and
pushing back his chair; ``I shall hereafter take care how I
honour with my company one who shows himself so ungrateful
for my condescension.''

  ``In that you will do as you find most agreeable, Sir Arthur;
---I hope, that as I was not aware of the extent of the obligation
which you have done me by visiting my poor house, I may
be excused for not having carried my gratitude to the extent
of servility.''

  ``Mighty well---mighty well, Mr. Oldbuck---I wish you a
good evening---Mr. a---a---a---Shovel---I wish you a very good
evening.''

  Out of the parlour door flounced the incensed Sir Arthur,
as if the spirit of the whole Round Table inflamed his single
bosom, and traversed with long strides the labyrinth of passages
which conducted to the drawing-room.

  ``Did you ever hear such an old tup-headed ass?'' said
Oldbuck, briefly apostrophizing Lovel. ``But I must not let
him go in this mad-like way neither.''

  So saying, he pushed off after the retreating Baronet, whom
he traced by the clang of several doors which he opened in
search of the apartment for tea, and slammed with force behind
him at every disappointment. ``You'll do yourself a mischief,''
roared the Antiquary; ``_Qui ambulat in tenebris, nescit quo
vadit_---You'll tumble down the back-stair.''

  Sir Arthur had now got involved in darkness, of which the
sedative effect is well known to nurses and governesses who
have to deal with pettish children. It retarded the pace of the
irritated Baronet, if it did not abate his resentment, and Mr.
Oldbuck, better acquainted with the _locale,_ got up with him as
he had got his grasp upon the handle of the drawing-room door.

  ``Stay a minute, Sir Arthur,'' said Oldbuck, opposing his
abrupt entrance; ``don't be quite so hasty, my good old friend. 
I was a little too rude with you about Sir Gamelyn---why, he is
an old acquaintance of mine, man, and a favourite; he kept
company with Bruce and Wallace---and, I'll be sworn on a
black-letter Bible, only subscribed the Ragman-roll with the
legitimate and justifiable intention of circumventing the false
Southern---'twas right Scottish craft, my good knight---hundreds
did it. Come, come, forget and forgive---confess we
have given the young fellow here a right to think us two testy
old fools.''

  ``Speak for yourself, Mr. Jonathan Oldbuck,'' said Sir Arthur
with much majesty.

  ``A-well, a-well---a wilful man must have his way.''

  With that the door opened, and into the drawing-room
marched the tall gaunt form of Sir Arthur, followed by Lovel
and Mr. Oldbuck, the countenances of all the three a little
discomposed.

  ``I have been waiting for you, sir,'' said Miss Wardour, ``to
propose we should walk forward to meet the carriage, as the
evening is so fine.''

  Sir Arthur readily assented to this proposal, which suited the
angry mood in which he found himself; and. having, agreeable
to the established custom in cases of pet, refused the refreshment
of tea and coffee, he tucked his daughter under his arm;
and after taking a ceremonious leave of the ladies, and a very
dry one of Oldbuck---off he marched.

  ``I think Sir Arthur has got the black dog on his back again,''
said Miss Oldbuck.

  ``Black dog!---black devil!---he's more absurd than womankind
---What say you, Lovel?---Why, the lad's gone too.''

  ``He took his leave, uncle, while Miss Wardour was putting
on her things; but I don't think you observed him.''

  ``The devil's in the people! This is all one gets by fussing
and bustling, and putting one's self out of one's way in order
to give dinners, besides all the charges they are put to!---O
Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia!'' said he, taking up a cup of tea
in the one hand, and a volume of the Rambler in the other,---
for it was his regular custom to read while he was eating or
drinking in presence of his sister, being a practice which served
at once to evince his contempt for the society of womankind,
and his resolution to lose no moment of instruction,---``O Seged,
Emperor of Ethiopia! well hast thou spoken---No man should
presume to say, This shall be a day of happiness.''

  Oldbuck proceeded in his studies for the best part of an hour,
uninterrupted by the ladies, who each, in profound silence, pursued
some female employment. At length, a light and modest
tap was heard at the parlour door. ``Is that you, Caxon?---
come in, come in, man.''

  The old man opened the door, and thrusting in his meagre
face, thatched with thin grey locks, and one sleeve of his white
coat, said in a subdued and mysterious tone of voice, ``I was
wanting to speak to you, sir.''

  ``Come in then, you old fool, and say what you have got to
say.''

  ``I'll maybe frighten the ladies,'' said the ex-friseur.

  ``Frighten!'' answered the Antiquary,---``what do you mean?
---never mind the ladies. Have you seen another ghaist at the
Humlock-knowe?''

  ``Na, sir---it's no a ghaist this turn,'' replied Caxton;---``but
I'm no easy in my mind.''

  ``Did you ever hear of any body that was?'' answered Oldbuck;---
``what reason has an old battered powder-puff like you
to be easy in your mind, more than all the rest of the world
besides?''

  ``It's no for mysell, sir; but it threatens an awfu' night; and
Sir Arthur, and Miss Wardour, poor thing''------

  ``Why, man, they must have met the carriage at the head of
the loaning, or thereabouts; they must be home long ago.''

  ``Na, sir; they didna gang the road by the turnpike to meet
the carriage, they gaed by the sands.''

  The word operated like electricity on Oldbuck. ``The sands!''
he exclaimed; ``impossible!''

  ``Ou, sir, that's what I said to the gardener; but he says he
saw them turn down by the Mussel-craig. In troth, says I to
him, an that be the case, Davie, I am misdoubting''------

  ``An almanac! an almanac!'' said Oldbuck, starting up in
great alarm---``not that bauble!'' flinging away a little pocket
almanac which his niece offered him.---``Great God! my poor
dear Miss Isabella!---Fetch me instantly the Fairport Almanac.''
---It was brought, consulted, and added greatly to his agitation. 
``I'll go myself---call the gardener and ploughman---bid them
bring ropes and ladders---bid them raise more help as they come
along---keep the top of the cliffs, and halloo down to them---
I'll go myself.''

  ``What is the matter?'' inquired Miss Oldbuck and Miss
M`Intyre.

  ``The tide!---the tide!'' answered the alarmed Antiquary.

  ``Had not Jenny better---but no, I'll run myself,'' said the
younger lady, partaking in all her uncle's terrors---``I'll run
myself to Saunders Mucklebackit, and make him get out his
boat.''

  ``Thank you, my dear, that's the wisest word that has been
spoken yet---Run! run!---To go by the sands!'' seizing his hat
and cane; ``was there ever such madness heard of!''
