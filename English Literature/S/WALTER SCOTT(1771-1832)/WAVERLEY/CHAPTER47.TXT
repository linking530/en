	THE CONFLICT.


  When Fergus Mac-Ivor and his friend had slept for a few
hours, they were awakened, and summoned to attend the Prince.
The distant village-clock was heard to toll three as they hastened
to the place where he lay. He was already surrounded by his
principal officers and the chiefs of clans. A bundle of pease-straw,
which had been lately his couch, now served for a seat.
Just as Fergus reached the circle, the consultation had broken
up. ``Courage, my brave friends!'' said the Chevalier, ``and each
one put himself instantly at the head of his command; a faithful
friend<*> has offered to guide us by a practicable, though narrow

and circuitous route, which, sweeping to our right, traverses the
broken ground and morass, and enables us to gain the firm and
open plain, upon which the enemy are lying. This difficulty
surmounted, Heaven and your good swords must do the rest.''

  The proposal spread unanimous joy, and each leader hastened
to get his men into order with as little noise as possible. The
army, moving by its right from of the ground on which they
had rested, soon entered the path through the morass, conducting
their march with astonishing silence and great rapidity.
The mist had not risen to the higher grounds, so that for some
time they had the advantage of starlight. But this was lost
as the stars faded before approaching day, and the head of the
marching column, continuing its descent, plunging as it were
into the heavy ocean of fog, which rolled its white waves over
the whole plain, and over the sea by which it was bounded.
Some difficulties were now to be encountered, inseparable from
darkness,---a narrow, broken, and marshy path, and the necessity
of preserving union in the march. These, however, were
less inconvenient to Highlanders, from their habits of life, than
they would have been to any other troops, and they continued a
steady and swift movement.

  As the clan of Ivor approached the firm ground, following
the track of those who preceded them, the challenge of a patrol
was heard through the mist, though they could not see the
dragoon by whom it was made---``Who goes there?''

  ``Hush!'' cried Fergus, ``hush!---Let none answer as he
values his life.---Press forward!'' and they continued their march
with silence and rapidity.

  The patrol fired his carabine upon the body, and the report
was instantly followed by the clang of his horse's feet as he
galloped off. ``_Hylax in limine latrat,_'' said the Baron of
Bradwardine, who heard the shot; ``that loon will give the
alarm.''

  The clan of Fergus had now gained the firm plain, which
had lately borne a large crop of corn. But the harvest was
gathered in, and the expanse was unbroken by tree, bush, or
interruption of any kind. The rest of the army were following
fast, when they heard the drums of the enemy beat the _general._
Surprise, however, had made no part of their plan, so they were
not disconcerted by this intimation that the foe was upon his
guard and prepared to receive them. It only hastened their
dispositions for the combat, which were very simple.

  The Highland army, which now occupied the eastern end of
the wide plain, or stubble field, so often referred to, was drawn
up in two lines, extending from the morass towards the sea.
The first was destined to charge the enemy, the second to act
as a reserve. The few horse, whom the Prince headed in person,
remained between the two lines. The Adventurer had intimated
a resolution to charge in person at the head of his first line;
but his purpose was deprecated by all around him, and he was
with difficulty induced to abandon it.

  Both lines were now moving forward, the first prepared for
instant combat. The clans of which it was composed, formed
each a sort of separate phalanx, narrow in front, and in depth
ten, twelve, or fifteen files, according to the strength of the
following. The best-armed and best-born, for the words were
synonymous, were placed in front of each of these irregular
subdivisions. The others in the rear shouldered forward the
front, and by their pressure added both physical impulse, and
additional ardour and confidence, to those who were first to
encounter the danger.

  ``Down with your plaid, Waverley,'' cried Fergus, throwing
off his own; ``we'll win silks for our tartans before the sun is
above the sea.''

  The clansmen on every side stript their plaids, prepared their
arms, and there was an awful pause of about three minutes,
during which the men, pulling off their bonnets, raised their
faces to heaven, and uttered a short prayer; then pulled their
bonnets over their brows, and began to move forward at first
slowly. Waverley felt his heart at that moment throb as it
would have burst from his bosom, It was not fear, it was not
ardour,---it was a compound of both, a new and deeply energetic
impulse, that with its first emotion chilled and astounded,
then fevered and maddened his mind. The sounds around him
combined to exalt his enthusiasm; the pipes played, and the
clans rushed forward, each in its own dark column. As they
advanced they mended their pace, and the muttering sounds of
the men to each other began to swell into a wild cry.
At this moment the sun, which was now risen above the
horizon, dispelled the mist. The vapours rose like a curtain,
and showed the two armies in the act of closing. The line of the
regulars was formed directly fronting the attack of the Highlanders;
it glittered with the appointments of a complete army,
and was flanked by cavalry and artillery. But the sight impressed
no terror on the assailants.

  ``Forward, sons of Ivor,'' cried their Chief, ``or the Camerons
will draw the first blood!''---They rushed on with a tremendous
yell.

  The rest is well known. The horse, who were commanded
to charge the advancing Highlanders in the flank, received an
irregular fire from their fusees as they ran on, and, seized with
a disgraceful panic, wavered, halted, disbanded, and galloped
from the field. The artillerymen, deserted by the cavalry, fled
after discharging their pieces, and the Highlanders, who dropped
their guns when fired, and drew their broadswords, rushed with
headlong fury against the infantry.

  It was at this moment of confusion and terror, that Waverley
remarked an English officer, apparently of high rank, standing
alone and unsupported by a field-piece, which, after the flight
of the men by whom it was wrought, he had himself levelled
and discharged against the clan of Mac-Ivor, the nearest group
of Highlanders within his aim. Struck with his tall, martial
figure, and eager to save him from inevitable destruction,
Waverley outstripped for an instant even the speediest of the
warriors, and, reaching the spot first, called to him to surrender.
The officer replied by a thrust with his sword, which Waverley
received in his target, and in turning it aside the Englishman's
weapon broke. At the same time the battle-axe of Dugald
Mahony was in the act of descending upon the officer's head.
Waverley intercepted and prevented the blow, and the officer, perceiving
further resistance unavailing, and struck with Edward's
generous anxiety for his safety, resigned the fragment of his
sword, and was committed by Waverley to Dugald, with strict
charge to use him well, and not to pillage his person, promising
him, at the same time, full indemnification for the spoil.

  On Edward's right, the battle for a few minutes raged fierce
and thick. The English infantry, trained in the wars in
Flanders, stood their ground with great courage. But their
extended files were pierced and broken in many places by the
close masses of the clans; and in the personal struggle which
ensued, the nature of the Highlanders' weapons, and their
extraordinary fierceness and activity, gave them a decided
superiority over those who had been accustomed to trust much
to their array and discipline, and felt that the one was broken
and the other useless. Waverley, as he cast his eyes towards
this scene of smoke and slaughter, observed Colonel Gardiner,
deserted by his own soldiers in spite of all his attempts to rally
them, yet spurring his horse through the field to take the command
of a small body of infantry, who, with their backs arranged
against the wall of his own park (for his house was close by the
field of battle), continued a desperate and unavailing resistance.
Waverley could perceive that he had already received many
wounds, his clothes and saddle being marked with blood. To
save this good and brave man, became the instant object of his
most anxious exertions. But he could only witness his fall.
Ere Edward could make his way among the Highlanders, who,
furious and eager for spoil, now thronged upon each other, he
saw his former commander brought from his horse by the blow
of a scythe, and beheld him receive, while on the ground;
more wounds than would have let out twenty lives. When
Waverley came up, however, perception had not entirely fled.
The dying warrior seemed to recognise Edward, for he fixed his
eye upon him with an upbraiding, yet sorrowful look, and
appeared to struggle for utterance. But he felt that death was
dealing closely with him, and resigning his purpose, and folding
his hands as if in devotion, he gave up his soul to his Creator.
The look with which he regarded Waverley in his dying moments
did not strike him so deeply at that crisis of hurry and confusion,
as when it recurred to his imagination at the distance of some
time.<*>

  Loud shouts of triumph now echoed over the whole field.
The battle was fought and won, and the whole baggage, artillery,
and military stores of the regular army remained in possession
of the victors. Never was a victory more complete. Scarce
any escaped from the battle, excepting the cavalry, who had left
it at the very onset, and even these were broken into different
parties, and scattered all over the country. So far as our tale
is concerned, we have only to relate the fate of Balmawhapple,
who, mounted on a horse as headstrong and stiff-necked as his
rider, pursued the flight of the dragoons above four miles from
the field of battle, when some dozen of the fugitives took heart
of grace, turned round, and, cleaving his skull with their broadswords,
satisfied the world that the unfortunate gentleman had
actually brains, the end of his life thus giving proof of a fact
greatly doubted during its progress. His death was lamented
by few. Most of those who knew him agreed in the pithy
observation of Ensign Maccombich, that there ``was mair _tint_
(lost) at Sheriff-Muir.'' His friend Lieutenant Jinker, bent his
eloquence only to exculpate his favourite mare from any share
in contributing to the catastrophe. ``He had tauld the laird a
thousand times,'' he said, ``that it was a burning shame to put
a martingale upon the puir thing, when he would needs ride
her wi' a curb of half-a-yard lang; and that he could na but
bring himsell (not to say her) to some mischief, by flinging her
down, or otherwise; whereas, if he had had a wee bit rinnin
ring on the snaffle, she wad ha' rein'd as cannily as a cadger's
pownie.''

  Such was the elegy of the Laird of Balmawhapple.<*>
