		(1829)

  The plan of this Edition leads me to insert in this place<*> some account

* [In the present edition the incidents referred to have been transferred to the
* Appendix, vide page <? p492>.<! p20>]

of the incidents on which the Novel of =Waverley= is founded. They
have been already given to the public by my late lamented friend
William Erskine, Esq. (afterwards Lord Kinneder), when reviewing
the Tales of My Landlord for the Quarterly Review, in 1817. The
particulars were derived by the Critic from the Author's information.
Afterwards they were published in the Preface to the Chronicles of the
Canongate. They are now inserted in their proper place.

  Other illustrations of Waverley will be found in the Notes at the
foot of the pages to which they belong. Those which appeared too
long to be so placed are given at the end of the Novel.
