	THE CONFUSION OF KING AGRAMANT'S CAMP.

  It was Waverley's custom sometimes to ride a little apart from
the main body, to look at any object of curiosity which occurred
on the march. They were now in Lancashire, when, attracted
by a castellated old hall, he left the squadron for half-an-hour,
to take a survey and slight sketch of it. As he returned down
the avenue, he was met by Ensign Maccombich. This man had
contracted a sort of regard for Edward since the day of his first
seeing him at Tully-Veolan, and introducing him to the Highlands.
He seemed to loiter, as if on purpose to meet with our
hero. Yet, as he passed him, he only approached his stirrup,
and pronounced the single word ``Beware!'' and then walked
swiftly on, shunning all further communication.

  Edward, somewhat surprised at this hint, followed with his
eyes the course of Evan, who speedily disappeared among the
trees. His servant, Alick Polwarth, who was in attendance,
also looked after the Highlander, and then riding up close to his
master, said,

  ``The ne'er be in me, sir, if I think you're safe among thae
Highland rinthereouts.''

  ``What do you mean, Alick?'' said Waverley.

  ``The Mac-Ivors, sir, hae gotten it into their heads, that ye
hae affronted their young leddy, Miss Flora; and I hae heard
mae than ane say, they wadna tak muckle to make a black-cock
o' ye; and ye ken weel eneugh there's mony o' them wadna
mind a bawbee the weising a ball through the Prince himsell,
an the Chief gae them the wink---or whether he did or no,---
if they thought it a thing that would please him when it was
dune.''

  Waverley, though confident that Fergus Mac-Ivor was incapable
of such treachery, was by no means equally sure of the
forbearance of his followers. He knew, that where the honour
of the Chief or his family was supposed to be touched, the
happiest man would be he that could first avenge the stigma;
and he had often heard them quote a proverb, ``That the best
revenge was the most speedy and most safe.'' Coupling this
with the hint of Evan, he judged it most prudent to set spurs
to his horse, and ride briskly back to the squadron. Ere he
reached the end of the long avenue, however, a ball whistled
past him, and the report of a pistol was heard.

  ``It was that deevil's buckie, Callum Beg,'' said Alick; ``I
saw him whisk away through amang the reises.''

  Edward, justly incensed at this act of treachery, galloped out
of the avenue, and observed the battalion of Mac-Ivor at some
distance moving along the common, in which it terminated.
He also saw an individual running very fast to join the party;
this he concluded was the intended assassin, who, by leaping an
enclosure, might easily make a much shorter path to the main
body than he could find on horseback. Unable to contain
himself, he commanded Alick to go to the Baron of Bradwardine,
who was at the head of his regiment about half a mile in
front, and acquaint him with what had happened. He himself
immediately rode up to Fergus's regiment. The Chief himself
was in the act of joining them. He was on horseback, having
returned from waiting on the Prince. On perceiving Edward
approaching, he put his horse in motion towards him.

  ``Colonel Mac-Ivor,'' said Waverley, without any farther
salutation, ``I have to inform you that one of your people has
this instant fired at me from a lurking-place.''

  ``As that,'' answered Mac-Ivor, ``excepting the circumstance
of a lurking-place, is a pleasure which I presently propose to
myself, I should be glad to know which of my clansmen dared
to anticipate me.''

  ``I shall certainly be at your command whenever you please;
---the gentleman who took your office upon himself is your page
there, Callum Beg.''

  ``Stand forth from the ranks, Callum! Did you fire at Mr.
Waverley?''

  ``No,'' answered the unblushing Callum.

  ``You did,'' said Alick Polwarth, who was already returned,
having met a trooper by whom he despatched an account of
what was going forward to the Baron of Bradwardine, while he
himself returned to his master at full gallop, neither sparing the
rowels of his spurs, nor the sides of his horse. ``You did; I
saw you as plainly as I ever saw the auld kirk at Coudingham.''

  ``You lie,'' replied Callum, with his usual impenetrable obstinacy.
The combat between the knights would certainly, as in
the days of chivalry, have been preceded by an encounter between
the squires (for Alick was a stouthearted Merseman, and
feared the bow of Cupid far more than a Highlander's dirk or
claymore), but Fergus, with his usual tone of decision, demanded
Callum's pistol. The cook was down, the pan and muzzle were
black with the smoke; it had been that instant fired.

  ``Take that,'' said Fergus, striking the boy upon the head
with the heavy pistol-butt with his whole force, ``take that for
acting without orders, and lying to disguise it.'' Callum received
the blow without appearing to flinch from it, and fell
without sign of life. ``Stand still, upon your lives!''
said Fergus to the rest of the clan; ``I blow out the brains of the
first man who interferes between Mr. Waverley and me.'' They
stood motionless; Evan Dhu alone showed symptoms of vexation
and anxiety. Callum lay on the ground bleeding copiously,
but no one ventured to give him any assistance. It seemed as
if he had gotten his death-blow.

  ``And now for you, Mr. Waverley; please to turn your horse
twenty yards with me upon the common.'' Waverley complied;
and Fergus, confronting him when they were a little way from
the line of march, said, with great affected coolness, ``I could
not but wonder, sir, at the fickleness of taste which you were
pleased to express the other day. But it was not an angel, as
you justly observed, who had charms for you, unless she brought
an empire for her fortune. I have now an excellent commentary
upon that obscure text.''

  ``I am at a loss even to guess at your meaning, Colonel
Mac-Ivor, unless it seems plain that you intend to fasten a
quarrel upon me.''

  ``Your affected ignorance shall not serve you, sir. The
Prince,---the Prince himself, has acquainted me with your
man<oe>uvres. I little thought that your engagements with Miss
Bradwardine were the reason of your breaking of your intended
match with my sister. I suppose the information that the
Baron had altered the destination of his estate, was quite a
sufficient reason for slighting your friend's sister, and carrying
off your friend's mistress.''

  ``Did the Prince tell you I was engaged to Miss Bradwardine?''
said Waverley. ``Impossible.''

  ``He did, sir,'' answered Mac-Ivor; ``so, either draw and
defend yourself, or resign your pretensions to the lady.''

  ``This is absolute madness,'' exclaimed Waverley, ``or some
strange mistake!''

  ``O! no evasion! draw your sword!'' said the infuriated
Chieftain,---his own already unsheathed.

  ``Must I fight in a madman's quarrel?''

  ``Then give up now, and for ever, all pretensions to Miss
Bradwardine's hand.''

  ``What title have you,'' cried Waverley, utterly losing command
of himself,---``What title have you, or any man living,
to dictate such terms to me?'' And he also drew his sword.
At this moment the Baron of Bradwardine, followed by several
of his troop, came up on the spur, some from curiosity, others
to take part in the quarrel, which they indistinctly understood
had broken out between the Mac-Ivors and their corps. The
clan, seeing them approach, put themselves in motion to support
their Chieftain, and a scene of confusion commenced, which
seemed likely to terminate in bloodshed. A hundred tongues
were in motion at once. The Baron lectured, the Chieftain
stormed, the Highlanders screamed in Gaelic, the horsemen
cursed and swore in Lowland Scotch. At length matters came
to such a pass, that the Baron threatened to charge the Mac-Ivors
unless they resumed their ranks, and many of them, in
return, presented their firearms at him and the other troopers.
The confusion was privately fostered by old Ballenkeiroch, who
made no doubt that his own day of vengeance was arrived,
when, behold! a cry arose of ``Room! make way!---_place <a`>
Monseigneur! place <a`> Monseigneur!_'' This announced the
approach of the Prince, who came up with a party of Fitz-James's
foreign dragoons that acted as his body guard. His
arrival produced some degree of order. The Highlanders reassumed
their ranks, the cavalry fell in and formed squadron, and
the Baron and Chieftain were silent.

  The Prince called them and Waverley before him. Having
heard the original cause of the quarrel through the villany of
Callum Beg, he ordered him into custody of the provost-marshal
for immediate execution, in the event of his surviving the
chastisement inflicted by his Chieftain. Fergus, however, in
a tone betwixt claiming a right and asking a favour, requested
he might be left to his disposal, and promised his punishment
should be exemplary. To deny this, might have seemed to
encroach on the patriarchal authority of the Chieftains, of which
they were very jealous, and they were not persons to be disobliged.
Callum was therefore left to the justice of his own tribe.

  The Prince next demanded to know the new cause of quarrel
between Colonel Mac-Ivor and Waverley. There was a pause.
Both gentlemen found the presence of the Baron of Bradwardine
(for by this time all three had approached the Chevalier by his
command) an insurmountable barrier against entering upon a
subject where the name of his daughter must unavoidably be
mentioned. They turned their eyes on the ground, with looks
in which shame and embarrassment were mingled with displeasure.
The prince, who had been educated amongst the
discontented and mutinous spirits of the court of St. Germains,
where feuds of every kind were the daily subject of solicitude to
the dethroned sovereign, had served his apprenticeship, as old
Frederick of Prussia would have said, to the trade of royalty.
To promote or restore concord among his followers was indispensable.
Accordingly he took his measures.

  ``Monsieur de Beaujeu!''

  ``Monseigneur!'' said a very handsome French cavalry officer,
who was in attendance.

  ``Ayez la bont<e'> d'alligner ces montagnards l<a`>, ainsi que la
cavalerie, s'il vous plait, et de les remettre <a`> la marche. Vous
parlez si bien l'Anglois, cela ne vous donneroit pas beaucoup do
peine.''

  ``Ah! pas du tout, Monseigneur,'' replied Mons. le Comte
de Beaujeu, his head bending down to the neck of his little
prancing highly-managed charger. Accordingly he _piaffed_ away,
in high spirits and confidence, to the head of Fergus's regiment,
although understanding not a word of Gaelic, and very little
English.

  ``Messieurs les sauvages Ecossois---dat is---gentilmans savages,
have the goodness d'arranger vous.''

  The clan, comprehending the order more from the gesture
than the words, and seeing the Prince himself present, hastened
to dress their ranks.

  ``Ah! ver well! dat is fort bien!'' said the Count de Beaujeu.
``Gentilmans sauvages---mais tr<e`>s bien---Eh bien!---Qu'est-ce
que vous appelez visage, Monsieur?'' (to a lounging trooper
who stood by him). ``Ah, oui! _face_---Je vous remercie, Monsieur.
---Gentilshommes, have de goodness to make de face to de
right par file, dat is, by files.---Marsh!---Mais tr<e`>s bien---encore,
Messieurs; il faut vous mettre <a`> la marche .... Marchez
donc, au nom de Dieu, parceque j'ai oubli<e'> le mot Anglois---
mais vous <e^>tes des braves gens, et me comprenez tr<e`>s bien.''

  The Count next hastened to put the cavalry in motion.
``Gentilmans cavalry, you must fall in.---Ah! par ma foi, I did
not say fall off? I am a fear de little gross fat gentilman is
moche hurt. Ah, mon Dieu! c'est le Commissaire qui nous
a apport<e'> les premi<e`>res nouvelles de ce maudit fracas. Je suis
trop f<a^>ch<e'>, Monsieur!''

  But poor Macwheeble, who, with a sword stuck across him,
and a white cockade as large as a pancake, now figured in the
character of a commissary, being overturned in the bustle
occasioned by the troopers hastening to get themselves in order
in the Prince's presence, before he could rally his galloway,
slunk to the rear amid the unrestrained laughter of the spectators.

  ``Eh bien, Messieurs, wheel to de right---Ah! dat is it!---
Eh, Monsieur de Bradwardine, ayez la bont<e'> de vous mettre
la t<e^>te de votre r<e'>giment, car, par Dieu, je n'en puis plus!''

  The Baron of Bradwardine was obliged to go to the assistance
of Monsieur do Beaujeu, after he had fairly expended his few
English military phrases. One purpose of the Chevalier was
thus answered. The other he proposed was, that in the eagerness
to hear and comprehend commands issued through such an
indistinct medium in his own presence, the thoughts of the
soldiers in both corps might get a current different from the
angry channel in which they were flowing at the time.
Charles Edward was no sooner left with the Chieftain and
Waverley, the rest of his attendants being at some distance,
than he said, ``If I owed less to your disinterested friendship,
I could be most seriously angry with both of you for this very
extraordinary and causeless broil, at a moment when my father's
service so decidedly demands the most perfect unanimity. But
the worst of my situation is, that my very best friends hold
they have liberty to ruin themselves, as well as the cause they
are engaged in, upon the slightest caprice.''

  Both the young men protested their resolution to submit
every difference to his arbitration. ``Indeed,'' said Edward,
``I hardly know of what I am accused. I sought Colonel Mac-Ivor
merely to mention to him that I had narrowly escaped
assassination at the hand of his immediate dependent---a
dastardly revenge, which I knew him to be incapable of
authorising. As to the cause for which he is disposed to fasten
a quarrel upon me, I am ignorant of it, unless it be that he
accuses me, most unjustly, of having engaged the affections of
a young lady in prejudice of his pretensions.''

  ``If there is an error,'' said the Chieftain, ``it arises from a
conversation which I held this morning with his Royal Highness
himself.''

  ``With me?'' said the Chevalier; ``how can Colonel Mac-Ivor
have so far misunderstood me?''

  He then led Fergus wide, and, after five minutes' earnest conversation,
spurred his horse towards Edward. ``Is it possible---
nay, ride up, Colonel, for I desire no secrets---Is it possible, Mr.
Waverley, that I am mistaken in supposing that you are an
accepted lover of Miss Bradwardine?---a fact of which I was
by circumstances, though not by communication from you, so
absolutely convinced, that I alleged it to Vich Ian Vohr this
morning as a reason why, without offence to him, you might
not continue to be ambitious of an alliance, which to an unengaged
person, even though once repulsed, holds out too many
charms to be lightly laid aside.''

  ``Your Royal Highness,'' said Waverley, ``must have founded
on circumstances altogether unknown to me, when you did me
the distinguished honour of supposing me an accepted lover
of Miss Bradwardine. I feel the distinction implied in the
supposition, but I have no title to it. For the rest, my confidence
in my own merits is too justly slight to admit of my
hoping for success in any quarter after positive rejection.''

  The Chevalier was silent for a moment, looking steadily at
them both, and then said, ``Upon my word, Mr. Waverley,
you are a less happy man than I conceived I had very good
reason to believe you.---But now, gentlemen, allow me to be
umpire in this matter, not as Prince Regent, but as Charles
Stuart, a brother adventurer with you in the same gallant
cause. Lay my pretensions to be obeyed by you entirely out of
view, and consider your own honour, and how far it is well, or
becoming, to give our enemies the advantage, and our friends
the scandal, of showing that, few as we are, we are not united.
And forgive me if I add, that the names of the ladies who
have been mentioned, crave more respect from us all than to be
made themes of discord.''

  He took Fergus a little apart, and spoke to him very earnestly
for two or three minutes, and then returning to Waverley, said,
``I believe I have satisfied Colonel Mac-Ivor that his resentment
was founded upon a misconception, to which, indeed, I myself
gave rise; and I trust Mr. Waverley is too generous to harbour
any recollection of what is past, when I assure him that such
is the case.---You must state this matter properly to your clan,
Vich Ian Vohr, to prevent a recurrence of their precipitate
violence.'' Fergus bowed. ``And now, gentlemen, let me have
the pleasure to see you shake hands.''

  They advanced coldly, and with measured steps, each apparently
reluctant to appear most forward in concession. They
did, however, shake hands, and parted, taking a respectful leave
of the Chevalier.

  Charles Edward<*> then rode to the head of the Mac-Ivors,

* Note Z. Prince Charles Edward.<! p364>

threw himself from his horse, begged a drink out of old
Ballenkeiroch's canteen, and marched about half-amile along
with them, inquiring into the history and connexions of
Sliochd nan Ivor, adroitly using the few words of Gaelic he
possessed, and affecting a great desire to learn it more
thoroughly. He then mounted his horse once more, and
galloped to the Baron's cavalry, which was in front; halted
them, and examined their accoutrements and state of discipline;
took notice of the principal gentlemen, and even of the cadets;
inquired after their ladies, and commanded their horses;---rode
about an hour with the Baron of Bradwardine, and endured
three long stories about Field-Marshal the Duke of Berwick.

  ``Ah, Beaujeu, mon cher ami,'' said he as he returned to his
usual place in the line of march, ``que mon m<e'>tier de prince
errant est ennuyant, par fois. Mais, courage! c'est le grand
jeu, apr<e`>s tout.''
