	WAVERLEY CONTINUES AT GLENNAQUOICH.


  As Flora concluded her song, Fergus stood before them. ``I
knew I should find you here, even without the assistance of my
friend Bran. A simple and unsublimed taste now, like my own,
would prefer a jet d'eau at Versailles to this cascade with all its
accompaniments of rock and roar; but this is Flora's Parnassus,
Captain Waverley, and that fountain her Helicon. It would
be greatly for the benefit of my cellar if she could teach her
coadjutor, Mac-Murrough, the value of its influence: he has just
drunk a pint of usquebaugh to correct, he said, the coldness of
the claret---Let me try its virtues.'' He sipped a little water
in the hollow of his hand, and immediately commenced, with a
theatrical air,---

	O Lady of the desert, hail!
	That lov'st the harping of the Gael,
	Through fair and fertile regions borne,
	Where never yet grew grass or corn.

But English poetry will never succeed under the influence of a
Highland Helicon.---_Allons courage!_---

	O vous, qui buvez, <a`> tasse pleine,
	A cette heureuse fontaine,
	O<u`> on ne voit, sur le rivage,
	    Que quelques vilains troupeaux,
	Suivis de nymphes de village,
	    Qui les escortent sans sabots''------


  ``A truce, dear Fergus! spare us those most tedious and
insipid persons of all Arcadia, Do not, for heaven's sake, bring
down Corridon and Lindor upon us.''

  ``Nay, if you cannot relish _la houlette et le chalumeau,_ have
with you in heroic strains.''

  ``Dear Fergus, you have certainly partaken of the inspiration
of Mac-Murrough's cup rather than of mine.''

  ``I disclaim it, _ma belle demoiselle,_ although I protest it would
be the more congenial of the two. Which of your crack-brained
Italian romancers is it that says,

	            Io d'Elicona niente
	Mi curo, in fe di Dio, che'l bere d'acque
	(Bea chi ber ne vuol) sempre me spiacque!<*>

*	Good sooth, I reck not of your Helicon;
*	Drink water whoso will, in faith I will drink none.


But if you prefer the Gaelic, Captain Waverley, here is little
Cathleen shall sing you Drimmindhu.---Come, Cathleen, _astore_
(_i.e._ my dear), begin; no apologies to the _Ceankinn<e'>._''

  Cathleen sung with much liveliness a little Gaelic song, the
burlesque elegy of a countryman on the loss of his cow, the
comic tones of which, though he did not understand the
language, made Waverley laugh more than once.<*>

*   This ancient Gaelic ditty is still well known, both in the Highlands
* and in Ireland. It was translated into English, and published, if I mistake
* not, under the auspices of the facetious Tom D'Urfey, by the title of
* ``Colley, my Cow.''


  ``Admirable, Cathleen!'' cried the Chieftain; ``I must find
you a handsome husband among the clansmen one of these
days.''

  Cathleen laughed, blushed, and sheltered herself behind her
companion.

  In the progress of their return to the castle, the Chieftain
warmly pressed Waverley to remain for a week or two, in order
to see a grand hunting party, in which he and some other
Highland gentlemen proposed to join. The charms of melody
and beauty were too strongly impressed in Edward's breast to
permit his declining an invitation so pleasing. It was agreed,
therefore, that he should write a note to the Baron of Bradwardine,
expressing his intention to stay a fortnight at Glennaquoich,
and requesting him to forward by the bearer (a _gilly_ of the
Chieftain's) any letters which might have arrived for him.

  This turned the discourse upon the Baron, whom Fergus
highly extolled as a gentleman and soldier. His character was
touched with yet more discrimination by Flora, who observed
that he was the very model of the old Scottish cavalier, with all
his excellences and peculiarities. ``It is a character, Captain
Waverley, which is fast disappearing; for its best point was a
self-respect, which was never lost sight of till now. But in the
present time the gentlemen whose principles do not permit them
to pay court to the existing government are neglected and degraded,
and many conduct themselves accordingly; and, like
some of the persons you have seen at Tully-Veolan, adopt habits
and companions inconsistent with their birth and breeding. The
ruthless proscription of party seems to degrade the victims whom
it brands, however unjustly. But let us hope that a brighter
day is approaching, when a Scottish country-gentleman may be
a scholar without the pedantry of our friend the Baron; a
sportsman without the low habits of Mr. Falconer; and a
judicious improver of his property, without becoming a boorish
two-legged steer like Killancureit.''

  Thus did Flora prophesy a revolution, which time indeed has
produced, but in a manner very different from what she had in
her mind.

  The amiable Rose was next mentioned, with the warmest
encomium on her person, manners, and mind. ``That man,''
said Flora, ``will find an inestimable treasure in the affections
of Rose Bradwardine who shall be so fortunate as to become
their object. Her very soul is in home, and in the discharge of
all those quiet virtues of which home is the centre. Her husband
will be to her what her father now is---the object of all her care,
solicitude, and affection. She will see nothing, and connect
herself with nothing, but by him and through him. If he is a
man of sense and virtue, she will sympathise in his sorrows,
divert his fatigue, and share his pleasures. If she becomes the
property of a churlish or negligent husband, she will suit his
taste also, for she will not long survive his unkindness. And,
alas, how great is the chance that some such unworthy lot may
be that of my poor friend!---O that I were a queen this
moment, and could command the most amiable and worthy
youth of my kingdom to accept happiness with the hand of Rose
Bradwardine!''

  ``I wish you would command her to accept mine _en attendant,_''
said Fergus laughing.

  I don't know by what caprice it was that this wish, however
jocularly expressed, rather jarred on Edward's feelings, notwithstanding
his growing inclination to Flora, and his indifference to
Miss Bradwardine. This is one of the inexplicabilities of human
nature, which we leave without comment.

  ``Yours, brother?'' answered Flora, regarding him steadily.
``No; you have another bride---Honour; and the dangers you
must run in pursuit of her rival would break poor Rose's heart.''

  With this discourse they reached the castle, and Waverley
soon prepared his despatches for Tully-Veolan. As he knew
the Baron was punctilious in such matters, he was about to
impress his billet with a seal on which his armorial bearings
were engraved, but he did not find it at his watch, and thought
he must have left it at Tully-Veolan. He mentioned his loss,
borrowing at the same time the family seal of the Chieftain.

  ``Surely,'' said Miss Mac-Ivor, ``Donald Bean Lean would
 not''------

  ``My life for him in such circumstances,'' answered her brother;
``besides, he would never have left the watch behind.''

  ``After all, Fergus,'' said Flora, ``and with every allowance,
I am surprised you can countenance that man.''

  ``I countenance him!---This kind sister of mine would persuade
you, Captain Waverley, that I take what the people of
old used to call a `steakraid,' that is, a `collop of the foray,' or,
in plainer words, a portion of the robber's booty, paid by him
to the Laird or Chief through whose grounds he drove his prey.
O, it is certain, that unless I can find some way to charm Flora's
tongue, General Blakency will send a sergeant's party from
Stirling (this he said with haughty and emphatic irony) to seize
Vich Ian Vohr, as they nickname me, in his own castle.''

  ``Now, Fergus, must not our guest be sensible that all this
is folly and affectation? You have men enough to serve you
without enlisting banditti, and your own honour is above taint.
---Why don't you send this Donald Bean Lean, whom I hate
for his smoothness and duplicity even more than for his rapine,
out of your country at once? No cause should induce me to
tolerate such a character.''

  ``_No_ cause, Flora?'' said the Chieftain significantly.

  ``No cause, Fergus! not even that which is nearest to my
heart. Spare it the omen of such evil supporters!''

  ``O but, sister,'' rejoined the Chief gaily, ``you don't consider
my respect for _la belle passion._ Evan Dhu Maccombich is in
love with Donald's daughter, Alice, and you cannot expect me
to disturb him in his amours. Why, the whole clan would cry
shame on me. You know it is one of their wise sayings that a
kinsman is part of a man's body, but a foster-brother is a piece
of his heart.''

  ``Well, Fergus, there is no disputing with you; but I would
all this may end well.''

  ``Devoutly prayed, my dear and prophetic sister, and the
best way in the world to close a dubious argument.---But hear
ye not the pipes, Captain Waverley? Perhaps you will like
better to dance to them in the hall, than to be deafened with
their harmony without taking part in the exercise they invite
us to.''

  Waverley took Flora's hand. The dance, song, and merry-making
proceeded, and closed the day's entertainment at the
castle of Vich Ian Vohr. Edward at length retired, his mind
agitated by a variety of new and conflicting feelings, which
detained him from rest for some time, in that not unpleasing
state of mind in which fancy takes the helm, and the soul
rather drifts passively along with the rapid and confused tide of
reflections, than exerts itself to encounter, systematise, or examine
them. At a late hour he fell asleep, and dreamed of
Flora Mac-Ivor.
