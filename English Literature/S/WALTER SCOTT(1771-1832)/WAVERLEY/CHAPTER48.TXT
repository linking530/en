	AN UNEXPECTED EMBARRASSMENT.


  When the battle was over, and all things coming into order,
the Baron of Bradwardine, returning from the duty of the day,
and having disposed those under his command in their proper
stations, sought the Chieftain of Glennaquoich and his friend
Edward Waverley. He found the former busied in determining
disputes among his clansmen about points of precedence and
deeds of valour, besides sundry high and doubtful questions
concerning plunder. The most important of the last respected
the property of a gold watch, which had once belonged to some
unfortunate English officer. The party against whom judgment
was awarded consoled himself by observing, ``She (_i.e._ the
watch, which he took for a living animal) died the very night
Vich Ian Vohr gave her to Murdock;'' the machine having, in
fact, stopped for want of winding up.

  It was just when this important question was decided, that
the Baron of Bradwardine, with a careful and yet important
expression of countenance, joined the two young men. He
descended from his reeking charger, the care of which he recommended
to one of his grooms. ``I seldom ban, sir,'' said he to
the man; ``but if you play any of your hound's-foot tricks, and
leave puir Berwick before he's sorted, to rin after spuilzie, deil
be wi' me if I do not give your craig a thraw.'' He then
stroked with great complacency the animal which had borne
him through the fatigues of the day, and having taken a tender
leave of him,---``Weel, my good young friends, a glorious and
decisive victory,'' said he; ``but these loons of troopers fled
ower soon. I should have liked to have shown you the true
points of the _pr<ae>lium equestre,_ or equestrian combat, whilk
their cowardice has postponed, and which I hold to be the pride
and terror of warfare. Weel, I have fought once more in this
old quarrel, though I admit I could not be so far _ben_ as you
lads, being that it was my point of duty to keep together our
handful of horse. And no cavalier ought in any wise to begrudge
honour that befalls his companions, even though they
are ordered upon thrice his danger, whilk, another time, by the
blessing of God, may be his own case.---But, Glennaquoich, and
you, Mr. Waverley, I pray ye to give me your best advice on a
matter of mickle weight, and which deeply affects the honour of
the house of Bradwardine.---I crave your pardon, Ensign Maccombich,
and yours, Inveraughlin, and yours, Edderalshendrach,
and yours, sir.''

  The last person he addressed was Ballenkeiroch, who, remembering
the death of his son, lowered on him with a look of
savage defiance. The Baron, quick as lightning at taking umbrage,
had already bent his brow, when Glennaquoich dragged
his major from the spot, and remonstrated with him, in the
authoritative tone of a chieftain, on the madness of reviving a
quarrel in such a moment.

  ``The ground is cumbered with carcases,'' said the old mountaineer,
turning sullenly away; ``_one more_ would hardly have
been kenn'd upon it; and if it wasna for yoursell, Vich Ian
Vohr, that one should be Bradwardine's or mine.''

  The chief soothed while he hurried him away; and then
returned to the Baron. ``It is Ballenkeiroch,'' he said, in an
under and confidential voice, ``father of the young man who
fell eight years since in the unlucky affair at the Mains.''

  ``Ah!'' said the Baron, instantly relaxing the doubtful
sternness of his features, ``I can take mickle fra a man to
whom I have unhappily rendered sic a displeasure as that. Ye
were right to apprize me, Glennaquoich; he may look as black
as midnight at Martinmas ere Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine
shall say he does him wrang. Ah! I have nae male lineage,
and I should bear with one I have made childless, though you
are aware the blood-wit was made up to your ain satisfaction
by assythment, and that I have since expedited letters of slains.
---Weel, as I have said, I have no male issue, and yet it is
needful that I maintain the honour of my house; and it is on
that score I prayed ye for your peculiar and private attention.''

  The two young men awaited to hear him in anxious curiosity.

  ``I doubt na, lads,'' he proceeded, ``but your education has
been sae seen to, that ye understand the true nature of the
feudal tenures?''

  Fergus, afraid of an endless dissertation, answered, ``Intimately,
Baron,'' and touched Waverley, as a signal to express
no ignorance.

  ``And ye are aware, I doubt not, that the holding of the
Barony of Bradwardine is of a nature alike honourable and
peculiar, being blanch (which Craig opines ought to be Latinated
_blancum,_ or rather _francum,_ a free holding) _pro servitio detrahendi,
seu exuendi, caligas regis post battalliam._'' Here Fergus turned
his falcon eye upon Edward, with an almost imperceptible rise
of his eyebrow, to which his shoulders corresponded in the same
degree of elevation. ``Now, twa points of dubitation occur to
me upon this topic. First, whether this service, or feudal
homage, be at any event due to the person of the Prince, the
words being, _per expressum, caligas_ =regis,= the boots of the king
himself; and I pray your opinion anent that particular before
we proceed farther.''

  ``Why, he is Prince Regent,'' answered Mac-Ivor, with
laudable composure of countenance; ``and in the court of
France all the honours are rendered to the person of the Regent
which are due to that of the King. Besides, were I to pull off
either of their boots, I would render that service to the young
Chevalier ten times more willingly than to his father.''

  ``Ay, but I talk not of personal predilections. However,
your authority is of great weight as to the usages of the court
of France: and doubtless the Prince, as _alter ego,_ may have a
right to claim the _homagium_ of the great tenants of the crown,
since all faithful subjects are commanded, in the commission of
regency, to respect him as the king's own person. Far, therefore,
be it from me to diminish the lustre of his authority, by
withholding this act of homage, so peculiarly calculated to give
it splendour; for I question if the Emperor of Germany hath
his boots taken off by a free baron of the empire. But here
lieth the second difficulty.---The Prince wears no boots, but
simply brogues and trews.''

  This last dilemma had almost disturbed Fergus's gravity.

  ``Why,'' said he, ``you know, Baron, the proverb tells us,
`It's ill taking the breeks off a Highlandman,'---and the boots
are here in the same predicament.''

  ``The word _calig<ae>,_ however,'' continued the Baron, ``though
I admit, that, by family tradition, and even in our ancient
evidents, it is explained _lie_ =boots,= means, in its primitive sense,
rather sandals; and Caius C<ae>sar, the nephew and successor of
Caius Tiberius, received the agnomen of Caligula, _a caligulis,
sive caligis levioribus, quibus adolescentior usus fuerat in exercitu
Germanici patris sui._ And the _calig<ae>_ were also proper to the
monastic bodies; for we read in an ancient Glossarium, upon
the rule of St Benedict, in the Abbey of St. Amand, that _calig<ae>_
were tied with latchets.''

  ``That will apply to the brogues,'' said Fergus.

  ``It will so, my dear Glennaquoich; and the words are
express: _Calig<ae> dict<ae> sunt quia ligantur; nam socci non ligantur,
sed tantum intromittuntur;_ that is, _calig<ae>_ are denominated from
the ligatures wherewith they are bound; whereas _socci,_ which
may be analogous to our mules, whilk the English denominate
slippers, are only slipped upon the feet. The words of the
charter are also alternative,---_exuere, seu detrahere;_ that is, to
_undo,_ as in the case of sandals or brogues; and to _pull off,_ as
we say vernacularly, concerning boots. Yet I would we had
more light; but I fear there is little chance of finding hereabout
any erudite author _de re vestiari<a^>._''

  ``I should doubt it very much,'' said the Chieftain, looking
around on the straggling Highlanders, who were returning
loaded with spoils of the slain, ``though the _res vestiaria_ itself
seems to be in some request at present.''

  This remark coming within the Baron's idea of jocularity,
he honoured it with a smile, but immediately resumed what to
him appeared very serious business.

  ``Bailie Macwheeble indeed holds an opinion, that this
honorary service is due, from its very nature, _si petatur tantum;_
only if his Royal Highness shall require of the great tenant of
the crown to perform that personal duty; and indeed he pointed
out the case in Dirleton's Doubts and Queries, Grippet _versus_
Spicer, anent the eviction of an estate _ob non solutum canonem,_
that is, for non-payment of a feu-duty of three peppercorns
a-year, whilk were taxt to be worth seven-eighths of a penny
Scots, in whilk the defender was assoilzied. But I deem it
safest, wi' your good favour, to place myself in the way of
rendering the Prince this service, and to proffer performance
thereof; and I shall cause the Bailie to attend with a schedule
of a protest, whilk he has here prepared (taking out a paper),
intimating, that if it shall be his Royal Highness's pleasure to
accept of other assistance at pulling off his _calig<ae>_ (whether the
same shall be rendered boots or brogues) save that of the said
Baron of Bradwardine, who is in presence ready and willing to
perform the same, it shall in no wise impinge upon or prejudice
the right of the said Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine to perform
the said service in future; nor shall it give any esquire, valet
of the chamber, squire, or page, whose assistance it may please
his Royal Highness to employ, any right, title, or ground, for
evicting from the said Cosmo, Comyne Bradwardine the estate
and barony of Bradwardine, and others held as aforesaid, by the
due and faithful performance thereof.''

  Fergus highly applauded this arrangement; and the Baron
took a friendly leave of them, with a smile of contented importance
upon his visage.

  ``Long live our dear friend the Baron,'' exclaimed the Chief,
as soon as he was out of hearing, ``for the most absurd original
that exists north of the Tweed! I wish to heaven I had recommended
him to attend the circle this evening with a boot-ketch
under his arm. I think he might have adopted the suggestion,
if it had been made with suitable gravity.''

  ``And how can you take pleasure in making a man of his
worth so ridiculous?''

  ``Begging pardon, my dear Waverley, you are as ridiculous
as he. Why, do you not see that the man's whole mind is
wrapped up in this ceremony? He has heard and thought of
it since infancy, as the most august privilege and ceremony in
the world; and I doubt not but the expected pleasure of
performing it was a principal motive with him for taking up
arms. Depend upon it, had I endeavoured to divert him from
exposing himself, he would have treated me as an ignorant
conceited coxcomb, or perhaps might have taken a fancy to cut
my throat; a pleasure which he once proposed to himself upon
some point of etiquette, not half so important, in his eyes, as
this matter of boots or brogues, of whatever the calig<ae> shall
finally be pronounced by the learned. But I must go to head-quarters
to prepare the Prince for this extraordinary scene.
My information will be well taken, for it will give him a hearty
laugh at present, and put him on his guard against laughing,
when it might be very _mal-a-propos._ So, _au revoir,_ my dear
Waverley.''
