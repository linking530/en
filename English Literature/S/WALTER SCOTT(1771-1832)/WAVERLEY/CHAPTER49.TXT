	THE ENGLISH PRISONER.


  The first occupation of Waverley, after he departed from the
Chieftain, was to go in quest of the officer whose life he had
saved. He was guarded, along with his companions in misfortune,
who were very numerous, in a gentleman's house near the
field of battle.

  On entering the room where they stood crowded together,
Waverley easily recognised the object of his visit, not only by
the peculiar dignity of his appearance, but by the appendage of
Dugald Mahony, with his battle-axe, who had stuck to him
from the moment of his captivity, as if he had been skewered
to his side. This close attendance was, perhaps, for the purpose
of securing his promised reward from Edward, but it also
operated to save the English gentleman from being plundered
in the scene of general confusion; for Dugald sagaciously argued,
that the amount of the salvage which he might be allowed,
would be regulated by the state of the prisoner, when he should
deliver him over to Waverley. He hastened to assure Waverley,
therefore, with more words than he usually employed, that he
had ``keepit ta _sidier roy_ haill, and that he wasna a plack the
waur since the ferry moment when his honour forbad her to gie
him a bit clamhewit wi' her Lochaber axe.''

  Waverley assured Dugald of a liberal recompense, and,
approaching the English officer, expressed his anxiety to do
anything which might contribute to his convenience under his
present unpleasant circumstances.

  ``I am not so inexperienced a soldier, sir,'' answered the
Englishman, ``as to complain of the fortune of war. I am
only grieved to see those scenes acted in our own island, which
I have often witnessed elsewhere with comparative indifference.''

  ``Another such day as this,'' said Waverley, ``and I trust the
cause of your regrets will be removed, and all will again return
to peace and order.''

  The officer smiled and shook his head. ``I must not forget
my situation so far as to attempt a formal confutation of that
opinion; but, notwithstanding your success, and the valour
which achieved it, you have undertaken a task to which your
strength appears wholly inadequate.''

  At this moment Fergus pushed into the press.

  ``Come, Edward, come along; the Prince has gone to Pinkie-house
for the night; and we must follow, or loose the whole
ceremony of the _calig<ae>._ Your friend, the Baron, has been
guilty of a great piece of cruelty; he has insisted upon dragging
Bailie Macwheeble out to the field of battle. Now you must
know the Bailie's greatest horror is an armed Highlander, or a
loaded gun; and there he stands, listening to the Baron's
instructions concerning the protest, ducking his head like a sea-gull
at the report of every gun and pistol that our idle boys are
firing upon the fields; and undergoing, by way of penance, at
every symptom of flinching, a severe rebuke from his patron,
who would not admit the discharge of a whole battery of cannon,
within point-blank distance, as an apology for neglecting a discourse,
in which the honour of his family is interested.''

  ``But how has Mr. Bradwardine got him to venture so far?''
said Edward.

  ``Why, he had come as far as Musselburgh, I fancy, in hopes
of making some of our wills; and the peremptory commands of
the Baron dragged him forward to Preston after the battle was
over. He complains of one or two of our ragamuffins having
put him in peril of his life, by presenting their pieces at him;
but as they limited his ransom to an English penny, I don't think
we need trouble the provost-marshal upon that subject. So,
come along, Waverley.''

  ``Waverley!'' said the English officer, with great emotion;
``the nephew of Sir Everard Waverley, of ------shire?''

  ``The same, Sir,'' replied our hero, somewhat surprised at the
tone in which he was addressed.

  ``I am at once happy and grieved,'' said the prisoner, ``to
have met with you.''

  ``I am ignorant, sir,'' answered Waverley, ``how I have
deserved so much interest.''

  ``Did your uncle never mention a friend called Talbot?''

  ``I have heard him talk with great regard of such a person,''
replied Edward; ``a colonel, I believe, in the army, and the
husband of Lady Emily Blandeville; but I thought Colonel
Talbot had been abroad.''

  ``I am just returned,'' answered the officer; ``and being in
Scotland, thought it my duty to act where my services promised
to be useful. Yes, Mr. Waverley, I am that Colonel Talbot,
the husband of the lady you have named; and I am proud to
acknowledge that I owe alike my professional rank and my
domestic happiness to your generous and noble-minded relative.
Good God! that I should find his nephew in such a dress, and
engaged in such a cause!''

  ``Sir,'' said Fergus, haughtily, ``the dress and cause are those
of men of birth and honour.''

  ``My situation forbids me to dispute your assertion,'' said
Colonel Talbot; ``otherwise it were no difficult matter to show,
that neither courage nor pride of lineage can gild a bad cause.
But, with Mr. Waverley's permission, and yours, sir, if yours
also must be asked, I would willingly speak a few words with
him on affairs connected with his own family.''

  ``Mr. Waverley, sir, regulates his own motions.---You will
follow me, I suppose, to Pinkie,'' said Fergus, turning to Edward,
``when you have finished your discourse with this new acquaintance?''
So saying, the Chief of Glennaquoich adjusted his plaid
with rather more than his usual air of haughty assumption, and
left the apartment.

  The interest of Waverley readily procured for Colonel Talbot
the freedom of adjourning to a large garden belonging to his
place of confinement. They walked a few paces in silence,
Colonel Talbot apparently studying how to open what he had
to say; at length he addressed Edward.

  ``Mr. Waverley, you have this day saved my life; and yet I
would to God that I had lost it, ere I had found you wearing
the uniform and cockade of these men.''

  ``I forgive your reproach, Colonel Talbot; it is well meant,
and your education and prejudices render it natural. But there
is nothing extraordinary in finding a man, whose honour has
been publicly and unjustly assailed, in the situation which
promised most fair to afford him satisfaction on his calumniators.''

  ``I should rather say, in the situation most likely to confirm
the reports which they have circulated,'' said Colonel Talbot,
``by following the very line of conduct ascribed to you. Are
you aware, Mr. Waverley, of the infinite distress and even
danger, which your present conduct has occasioned to your
nearest relatives?''

  ``Danger!''

  ``Yes, sir, danger. When I left England, your uncle and
father had been obliged to find bail to answer a charge of
treason, to which they were only admitted by the exertion of
the most powerful interest. I came down to Scotland, with the
sole purpose of rescuing you from the gulf into which you have
precipitated yourself; nor can I estimate the consequences to
your family of your having openly joined the rebellion, since
the very suspicion of your intention was so perilous to them.
Most deeply do I regret that I did not meet you before this last
and fatal error.''

  ``I am really ignorant,'' said Waverley in a tone of reserve,
``why Colonel Talbot should have taken so much trouble on
my account.''

  ``Mr. Waverley,'' answered Talbot, ``I am dull at apprehending
irony; and therefore I shall answer your words
according to their plain meaning. I am indebted to your uncle
for benefits greater than those which a son owes to a father. I
acknowledge to him the duty of a son; and as I know there is no
manner in which I can requite his kindness so well as by serving
you, I will serve you, if possible, whether you will permit me or
no. The personal obligation which you have this day laid me
under (although in common estimation as great as one human
being can bestow on another) adds nothing to my zeal on your
behalf; nor can that zeal be abated by any coolness with which
you may please to receive it.''

  ``Your intentions may be kind, sir,'' said Waverley, drily;
``but your language is harsh, or at least peremptory.''

  ``On my return to England,'' continued Colonel Talbot,
``after long absence, I found your uncle, Sir Everard Waverley,
in the custody of a kings messenger, in consequence of the
suspicion brought upon him by your conduct. He is my oldest
friend---how often shall I repeat it?---my best benefactor; he
sacrificed his own views of happiness to mine---he never uttered
a word, he never harboured a thought, that benevolence itself
might not have thought or spoken. I found this man in confinement,
rendered harsher to him by his habits of life, his
natural dignity of feeling, and---forgive me, Mr. Waverley---by
the cause through which this calamity had come upon him. I
cannot disguise from you my feelings upon this occasion; they
were most painfully unfavourable to you. Having, by my
family interest, which you probably know is not inconsiderable,
succeeded in obtaining Sir Everard's release, I set out for
Scotland. I saw Colonel Gardiner, a man whose fate alone is
sufficient to render this insurrection for ever execrable. In the
course of conversation with him, I found, that, from late circumstances,
from a re-examination of the persons engaged in the
mutiny, and from his original good opinion of your character,
he was much softened towards you; and I doubted not, that if
I could be so fortunate as to discover you all might yet be
well. But this unnatural rebellion has ruined all. I have,
for the first time, in a long and active military life, seen
Britons disgrace themselves by a panic flight, and that before
a foe without either arms or discipline! and now I find the
heir of my dearest friend---the son, I may say, of his affections
---sharing a triumph, for which he ought the first to have blushed.
Why should I lament Gardiner? his lot was happy, compared
to mine!''

  There was so much dignity in Colonel Talbot's manner, such
a mixture of military pride and manly sorrow, and the news of
Sir Everard's imprisonment was told in so deep a tone of feeling,
that Edward stood mortified, abashed, and distressed, in
presence of the prisoner, who owed to him his life not many
hours before. He was not sorry when Fergus interrupted their
conference a second time.

  ``His Royal Highness commands Mr. Waverley's attendance.''
Colonel Talbot threw upon Edward a reproachful
glance, which did not escape the quick eye of the Highland
Chief. ``His _immediate_ attendance,'' he repeated, with considerable
emphasis. Waverley turned again towards the
Colonel.

  ``We shall meet, again,'' he said; ``in the meanwhile, every
possible accommodation''---

  ``I desire none,'' said the Colonel; ``let me fare like the
meanest of those brave men, who, on this day of calamity, have
preferred wounds and captivity to flight; I would almost
exchange places with one of those who have fallen, to know
that my words have made a suitable impression on your mind.''

  ``Let Colonel Talbot be carefully secured,'' said Fergus to the
Highland officer, who commanded the guard over the prisoners;
``It is the Prince's particular command; he is a prisoner of the
utmost importance.''

  ``But let him want no accommodation suitable to his rank,''
said Waverley.

  ``Consistent always with secure custody,'' reiterated Fergus.
The officer signified his acquiescence in both commands, and
Edward followed Fergus to the garden-gate, where Callum
Beg, with three saddle-horses, awaited them. Turning his
head, he saw Colonel Talbot reconducted to his place of confinement
by a file of Highlanders; he lingered on the threshold
of the door, and made a signal with his hand towards Waverley,
as if enforcing the language he had held towards him.

  ``Horses,'' said Fergus, as he mounted, ``are now as plenty
as blackberries; every man may have them for the catching.
Come, let Callum adjust your stirrups, and let us to
Pinkie-house<*> as fast as these ci-divant dragoon-horses choose

*   Charles Edward took up his quarters after the battle at Pinkie-house,
* adjoining to Musselburgh.

to carry us.''
