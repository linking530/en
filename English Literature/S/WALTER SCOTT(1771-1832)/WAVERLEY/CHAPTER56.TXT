	EXERTION.


  When Colonel Talbot entered the breakfast-parlour next morning,
he learned from Waverley's servant that our hero had been
abroad at an early hour, and was not yet returned. The morning
was well advanced before he again appeared. He arrived
out of breath, but with an air of joy that astonished Colonel
Talbot.

  ``There,'' said he, throwing a paper on the table, ``there is
my morning's work---Alick, pack up the Colonel's clothes.
Make haste, make haste.''

  The Colonel examined the paper with astonishment. It was
a pass from the Chevalier to Colonel Talbot, to repair to Leith,
or any other port in possession of his Royal Highness's troops,
and there to embark for England or elsewhere, at his free
pleasure; he only giving his parole of honour not to bear arms
against the house of Stuart for the space of a twelvemonth.

  ``In the name of God,'' said the Colonel, his eyes sparkling
with eagerness, ``how did you obtain this?''

  ``I was at the Chevalier's levee as soon as he usually rises.
He was gone to the camp at Duddingston. I pursued him
thither; asked and obtained an audience---but I will tell you
not a word more, unless I see you begin to pack.''

  ``Before I know whether I can avail myself of this passport,
or how it was obtained?''

  ``O, you can take out the things again, you know.---Now, I
see you busy, I will go on. When I first mentioned your
name, his eyes sparkled almost as bright as yours did two
minutes since. `Had you,' he earnestly asked, `shown any
sentiments favourable to his cause?' `Not in the least, nor
was there any hope you would do so.' His countenance fell. I
requested your freedom. `Impossible,' he said;---`your importance,
as a friend and confidant of such and such personages,
made my request altogether extravagant.' I told him my own
story and yours; and asked him to judge what my feelings
must be by his own. He has a heart, and a kind one, Colonel
Talbot, you may say what you please. He took a sheet of
paper, and wrote the pass with his own hand. `I will not trust
myself with my council,' he said; `they will argue me out of
what is right. I will not endure that a friend, valued as I
value you, should be loaded with the painful reflections which
must afflict you in case of further misfortune in Colonel Talbot's
family; nor will I keep a brave enemy a prisoner under such
circumstances. Besides,' said he, `I think I can justify myself
to my prudent advisers, by pleading the good effect such lenity
will produce on the minds of the great English families with
whom Colonel Talbot is connected.'

  ``There the politician peeped out,'' said the Colonel.

  ``Well, at least he concluded like a king's son.---`Take the
passport; I have added a condition for form's sake; but if the
Colonel objects to it, let him depart without giving any parole
whatever. I come here to war with men, but not to distress or
endanger women.' ''

  ``Well, I never thought to have been so much indebted to
the Pretend''------

  ``To the Prince,'' said Waverley, smiling.

  ``To the Chevalier,'' said the Colonel; ``it is a good travelling
name, and which we may both freely use. Did he say
anything more?''

  ``Only asked if there was anything else he could oblige me
in; and when I replied in the negative, he shook me by the
hand, and wished all his followers were as considerate, since
some friends of mine not only asked all he had to bestow, but
many things which were entirely out of his power, or that of
the greatest sovereign upon earth. Indeed, he said, no prince
seemed, in the eyes of his followers, so like the Deity as himself,
if you were to judge from the extravagant requests which they
daily preferred to him.''

  ``Poor young gentleman!'' said the Colonel; ``I suppose he
begins to feel the difficulties of his situation. Well, dear
Waverley, this is more than kind, and shall not be forgotten
while Philip Talbot can remember anything. My life---pshaw
---let Emily thank you for that---this is a favour worth fifty
lives. I cannot hesitate on giving my parole in the circumstances:
there it is---(he wrote it out in form)---and now, how
am I to get off?''

  ``All that is settled: your baggage is packed, my horses wait,
and a boat has been engaged, by the Prince's permission, to put
you on board the Fox frigate. I sent a messenger down to
Leith on purpose.''

  ``That will do excellently well. Captain Beaver is my
particular friend: he will put me ashore at Berwick or Shields,
from whence I can ride post to London;---and you must entrust
me with the packet of papers which you recovered by means of
your Miss Bean Lean. I may have an opportunity of using
them to your advantage---But I see your Highland friend,
Glen------what do you call his barbarous name? and his orderly
with him---I must not call him his orderly cut-throat any more,
I suppose. See how he walks as if the world were his own,
with the bonnet on one side of his head, and his plaid puffed
out across his breast! I should like now to meet that youth
where my hands were not tied: I would tame his pride, or he
should tame mine.''

  ``For shame, Colonel Talbot! you swell at sight of tartan,
as the bull is said to do at scarlet. You and Mac-Ivor have
some points not much unlike, so far as national prejudice is
concerned.''

  The latter part of this discourse took place in the street.
They passed the Chief, the Colonel and he sternly and punctiliously
greeting each other, like two duellists before they take
their ground. It was evident the dislike was mutual. ``I
never see that surly fellow that dogs his heels,'' said the Colonel,
after he had mounted his horse, ``but he reminds me of lines I
have somewhere heard---upon the stage, I think:

	--------------- Close behind him
	Stalks sullen Bertram, like a sorcerer's fiend,
	Pressing to be employed.''


  ``I assure you, Colonel,'' said Waverley, ``that you judge too
harshly of the Highlanders.''

  ``Not a whit, not a whit; I cannot spare them a jot---I
cannot bate them an ace. Let them stay in their own barren
mountains, and puff and swell, and hang their bonnets on the
horns of the moon, if they have a mind: but what business
have they to come where people wear breeches, and speak an
intelligible language? I mean intelligible in comparison with
their gibberish, for even the Lowlanders talk a kind of English
little better than the negroes in Jamaica. I could pity the
Pr------, I mean the Chevalier himself, for having so many
desperadoes about him. And they learn their trade so early.
There is a kind of subaltern imp, for example, a sort of sucking
devil, whom your friend Glenna---Glenamuck there, has sometimes
in his train. To look at him he is about fifteen years;
but he is a century old in mischief and villany. He was playing
at quoits the other day in the court; a gentleman---a
decent-looking person enough---came past, and as a quoit hit
his shin, he lifted his cane: but my young bravo whips out his
pistol, like Beau Clincher in the trip to the Jubilee, and had
not a scream of _Gardez l'eau_ from an upper window set all
parties a scampering for fear of the inevitable consequences, the
poor gentleman would have lost his life by the hands of that
little cockatrice.''

  ``A fine character you'll give of Scotland upon your return,
Colonel Talbot.''

  ``O, Justice Shallow,'' said the Colonel, ``will save me the
trouble---`Barren, barren---beggars all, beggars all. Marry,
good air,'---and that only when you are fairly out of Edinburgh,
and not yet come to Leith, as is our case at present.''

  In a short time they arrived at the seaport:

	The boat rocked at the pier of Leith,
	 Full loud the wind blew down the ferry;
	The ship rode at the Berwick Law------


  ``Farewell, Colonel; may you find all as you would wish it!
Perhaps we may meet sooner than you expect: they talk of an
immediate route to England.''

  ``Tell me nothing of that,'' said Talbot; ``I wish to carry no
news of your motions.''

  ``Simply then, adieu. Say, with a thousand kind greetings,
all that is dutiful and affectionate to Sir Everard and Aunt
Rachel. Think of me as kindly as you can----speak of me as
indulgently as your conscience will permit, and once more
adieu.''

  ``And adieu, my dear Waverley!---many, many thanks for
your kindness. Unplaid yourself on the first opportunity. I
shall ever think on you with gratitude, and the worst of my
censure shall be, _Que diable alloit-il faire dans cette gal<e`>re?_''

  And thus they parted, Colonel Talbot going on board of the
boat, and Waverley returning to Edinburgh.
