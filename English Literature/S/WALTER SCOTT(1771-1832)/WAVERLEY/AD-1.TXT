	ADVERTISEMENT.

  In printing this New Edition of the Waverley Novels, the
Publishers have availed themselves of the opportunity thus
afforded them of carefully collating it with the valuable interleaved
copy in their possession, containing the Author's latest
manuscript corrections and notes; and from this source they
have obtained several annotations of considerable interest, never
before published. As examples of some of the more important
of these may be mentioned the notes on ``High Jinks'' in Guy
Mannering, ``Pr<ae>torium'' in the Antiquary, and the ``Expulsion
of the Scotch Bishops'' in the Heart of Midlothian.

  There have also been inserted (within brackets) some minor
notes explanatory of references now rendered perhaps somewhat
obscure by the lapse of time. For these, the Publishers have
been chiefly indebted to Mr. David Laing, Secretary of the
Bannatyne Club, and one of the few surviving friends of the
Author.

  Fortunately there is now little more required in the way of
annotation to the Waverley Novels; but in order to afford every
facility of reference, a special glossary has been added to such
of the novels as require it, and each volume will contain a
separate index. A General Index will also be appended to the
concluding volume of the series.
