	A SOLDIER'S DINNER.


  James of the Needle was a man of his word, when whisky was
no party to the contract; and upon this occasion Callum Beg,
who still thought himself in Waverley's debt, since he had
declined accepting compensation at the expense of mine Host
of the Candlestick's person, took the opportunity of discharging
the obligation, by mounting guard over the hereditary tailor of
Sliochd nan Ivor; and, as he expressed himself, ``targed him
tightly,'' till the finishing of the job. To rid himself of this
restraint, Shemus's needle flew through the tartan like lightning;
and as the artist kept chanting some dreadful skirmish
of Fin Macoul, he accomplished at least three stitches to the
death of every hero. The dress was, therefore, soon ready, for
the short coat fitted the wearer, and the rest of the apparel
required little adjustment.

  Our hero having now fairly assumed the ``garb of Old Gaul,''
well calculated as it was to give an appearance of strength to
a figure, which, though tall and well-made, was rather elegant
than robust, I hope my fair readers will excuse him if he looked
at himself in the mirror more than once, and could not help
acknowledging that the reflection seemed that of a very handsome
young fellow. In fact, there was no disguising it. His
light-brown hair---for he wore no periwig, notwithstanding
the universal fashion of the time---became the bonnet which
surmounted it. His person promised firmness and agility, to
which the ample folds of the tartan added an air of dignity.
His blue eyes seemed of that kind,

	Which melted in love, and which kindled in war;

and an air of bashfulness, which was in reality the effect of
want of habitual intercourse with the world, gave interest to
his features, without injuring their grace or intelligence.

  ``He's a pratty man---a very pratty man,'' said Evan Dhu
(now Ensign Maccombich) to Fergus's buxom landlady.

  ``He's vera weel,'' said the Widow Flockhart, ``but no
naething sae weel-faured as your Colonel, ensign.''

  ``I wasna comparing them,'' quoth Evan, ``nor was I speaking
about his being weel-favoured; but only that Mr. Waverley
looks clean made and _deliver,_ and like a proper lad of his
quarters, that will not cry barley in a brulzie. And, indeed,
he's gleg eneuch at the broadsword and target. I hae played
wi' him mysell at Glennaquoich, and sae has Vich Ian Vohr,
often of a Sunday afternoon.''

  ``Lord forgie ye, Ensign Maccombich,'' said the alarmed
Presbyterian; ``I'm sure the colonel wad never do the like o'
that!''

  ``Hout! hout! Mrs. Flockhart,'' replied the ensign, ``we're
young blude, ye ken; and young saints, auld deils.''

  ``But will ye fight wi' Sir John Cope the morn, Ensign
Maccombich?'' demanded Mrs. Flockhart of her guest.

  ``Troth I'se ensure him, an' he'll bide us, Mrs. Flockhart,''
replied the Gael.

  ``And will ye face thae tearing chields, the dragoons,
Ensign Maccombich?'' again inquired the landlady.

  ``Claw for claw as Conan said to Satan, Mrs. Flockhart, and
the deevil tak the shortest nails.''

  ``And will the colonel venture on the bagganets himself?''

  ``Ye may swear it, Mrs. Flockhart; the very first man will
he be, by Saint Phedar.''

  ``Merciful goodness! and if he's killed amang the red-coats!''
exclaimed the softhearted widow.

  ``Troth, if it should sae befall, Mrs. Flockhart, I ken ane
that will no be living to weep for him. But we maun a' live
the day, and have our dinner; and there's Vich Ian Vohr has
packed his _dorlach,_ and Mr. Waverley's wearied wi' majoring
yonder afore the muckle pier-glass; and that grey auld stoor
carle, the Baron o' Bradwardine, that shot young Ronald of
Ballenkeiroch, he's coming down the close wi' that droghling
coghling bailie body they ca' Macwhupple, just like the Laird
o' Kittlegab's French cook, wi' his turnspit doggie trindling
ahint him, and I am as hungry as a gled, my bonnie dow; sae
bid Kate set on the broo', and do ye put on your pinners, for
ye ken Vich Ian Vohr winna sit down till ye be at the head o'
the table;---and dinna forget the pint bottle o' brandy, my
woman.''

  This hint produced dinner. Mrs. Flockhart, smiling in her
weeds like the sun through a mist, took the head of the table,
thinking within herself, perhaps, that she cared not how long
the rebellion lasted, that brought her into company, so much
above her usual associates. She was supported by Waverley
and the Baron, with the advantage of the Chieftain _vis-<a`>-vis._
The men of peace and of war, that is, Bailie Macwheeble and
Ensign Maccombich, after many profound cong<e'>s to their
superiors and each other, took their places on each side of the
Chieftain. Their fare was excellent, time, place, and circumstances
considered, and Fergus's spirits were extravagantly high.
Regardless of danger, and sanguine from temper, youth, and
ambition, he saw in imagination all his prospects crowned with
success, and was totally indifferent to the probable alternative
of a soldier's grave. The Baron apologised slightly for bringing
Macwheeble. They had been providing, he said, for the expenses
of the campaign. ``And, by my faith,'' said the old
man, ``as I think this will be my last, so I just end where I
began---I hae evermore found the sinews of war, as a learned
author calls the _caisse militaire,_ mair difficult to come by than
either its flesh, blood, or bones.''

  ``What! have you raised our only efficient body of cavalry,
and got ye none of the louis-d'or out of the Doutelle,<*> to help

*   The _Doutelle_ was an armed vessel, which brought a small supply of
* money and arms from France for the use of the insurgents.

you?''

  ``No, Glennaquoich; cleverer fellows have been before me.''

  ``That's a scandal,'' said the young Highlander; ``but you
will share what is left of my subsidy: it will save you an
anxious thought to-night, and will be all one to-morrow, for
we shall all be provided for, one way or other, before the sun
sets.'' Waverley, blushing deeply, but with great earnestness,
pressed the same request.

  ``I thank ye baith, my good lads,'' said the Baron, ``but I
will not infringe upon your peculium. Bailie Macwheeble has
provided the sum which is necessary.''

  Here the Bailie shifted and fidgeted about in his seat, and
appeared extremely uneasy. At length, after several preliminary
hems, and much tautological expression of his devotion
to his honour's service, by night or day, living or dead, he began
to insinuate, ``that the Banks had removed a' their ready cash
into the Castle; that, nae doubt, Sandie Goldie, the silversmith,
would do mickle for his honour; but there was little time to
get the wadset made out; and, doubtless, if his honour Glennaquoich,
or Mr. Wauverley, could accommodate''---

  ``Let me hear of no such nonsense, sir,'' said the Baron, in a
tone which rendered Macwheeble mute, ``but proceed as we
accorded before dinner, if it be your wish to remain in my
service.''

  To this peremptory order the Bailie, though he felt as if
condemned to suffer a transfusion of blood from his own veins
into those of the Baron, did not presume to make any reply.
After fidgeting a little while longer, however, he addressed himself
to Glennaquoich, and told him, if his honour had mair
ready siller than was sufficient for his occasions in the field, he
could put it out at use for his honour in safe hands, and at
great profit, at this time.

  At this proposal Fergus laughed heartily, and answered, when
he had recovered his breath,---``Many thanks, Bailie; but you
must know it is a general custom among us soldiers to make
our landlady our banker.---Here, Mrs. Flockhart,'' said he,
taking four or five broad pieces out of a well-filled purse, and
tossing the purse itself, with its remaining contents, into her
apron, ``these will serve my occasions; do you take the rest:
be my banker if I live, and my executor if I die; but take care
to give something to the Highland cailliachs<*> that shall cry the

*   Old women, on whom devolved the duty of lamenting for the dead,
* which the Irish call _keening._

coronach loudest for the last Vich Ian Vohr.''

  ``It is the _testamentum militare,_'' quoth the Baron, ``whilk,
amang the Romans, was privilegiate to be nuncupative.'' But
the soft heart of Mrs. Flockhart was melted within her at the
Chieftain's speech; she set up a lamentable blubbering, and
positively refused to touch the bequest, which Fergus was therefore
obliged to resume.

  ``Well then,'' said the Chief, ``if I fall, it will go to the
grenadier that knocks my brains out, and I shall take care he
works hard for it.''

  Bailie Macwheeble was again tempted to put in his oar; for
where cash was concerned, he did not willingly remain silent.
``Perhaps he had better carry the gowd to Miss Mac-Ivor, in
case of mortality, or accidents, of war. It might tak the form
of a _mortis causa_ donation in the young leddie's favour, and wad
cost but the scrape of a pen to mak it out.''

  ``The young lady,'' said Fergus, ``should such an event
happen, will have other matters to think of than these wretched
louis-d'or.''

  ``True---undeniable,---there's nae doubt o' that; but your
honour kens, that a full sorrow''------

  ``Is endurable by most folk more easily than a hungry one?
---True, Bailie, very true; and I believe there may even be
some who would be consoled by such a reflection for the loss of
the whole existing generation. But there is a sorrow which
knows neither hunger nor thirst; and poor Flora''---He
paused, and the whole company sympathized in his emotion.

  The Baron's thoughts naturally reverted to the unprotected
state of his daughter, and the big tear came to the veteran's
eye. ``If I fall, Macwheeble; you have all my papers, and
know all my affairs; be just to Rose.''

  The Bailie was a man of earthly mould after all; a good deal
of dirt and dross about him, undoubtedly, but some kindly and
just feelings he had, especially where the Baron or his young
mistress were concerned. He set up a lamentable howl. ``If
that doleful day should come, while Duncan Macwheeble had
a boddle, it should be Miss Rose's. He wald scroll for a plack
the sheet, or she kenn'd what it was to want; if indeed a' the
bonnie baronie o' Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, with the
fortalice and manor-place thereof (he kept sobbing and whining
at every pause), tofts, crofts, mosses, muirs---outfield, infield---
buildings---orchards---dovecots---with the right of net and coble
in the water and loch of Veolan---teinds, parsonage and vicarage
---annexis, connexis---rights of pasturage---fuel, feal, and divot
---parts, pendicles, and pertinents whatsoever---(here he had
recourse to the end of his long cravat to wipe his eyes, which
overflowed in spite of him, at the ideas which this technical
jargon conjured up)---all as more fully described in the proper
evidents and titles thereof---and lying within the parish of
Bradwardine, and the shire of Perth---if, as aforesaid, they
must a' pass from my master's child to Inch-Grabbit, wha's a
Whig and a Hanoverian, and be managed by his doer, Jamie
Howie, wha's no fit to be a birlieman, let be a bailie''---

  The beginning of this lamentation really had something
affecting, but the conclusion rendered laughter irresistible.

  ``Never mind, Bailie,'' said Ensign Maccombich, ``for the gude
auld times of rugging and riving (pulling and tearing) are come
back again, an' Sneckus Mac-Snackus (meaning, probably,
annexis, connexis), and a' the rest of your friends, maun gie
place to the langest claymore.''

  ``And that claymore shall be ours, Bailie,'' said the Chieftain,
who saw that Macwheeble looked very blank at this
intimation.

      ``We'll give them the metal our mountain affords,
		Lillibulero bullen a la,
	And in place of broad-pieces we'll pay with broadswords,
		Lero, lero, etc.
	With duns and with debts we will soon clear our score,
		Lillibulero, etc.
	For the man that's thus paid will crave payment no more,
		Lero, lero, etc.<*>

*   These lines, or something like them, occur in an old Magazine of the
* period.

But come, Bailie, be not cast down; drink your wine with a
joyous heart; the Baron shall return safe and victorious to
Tully-Veolan, and unite Killancureit's lairdship with his own,
since the cowardly half-bred swine will not turn out for the
Prince like a gentleman.''

  ``To be sure, they lie maist ewest,''<*> said the Bailie, wiping

* _i.e.,_ Contiguous.

his eyes, ``and should naturally fa' under the same factory.''

  ``And I,'' proceeded the Chieftain, ``shall take care of myself,
too; for you must know, I have to complete a good work here,
by bringing Mrs. Flockhart into the bosom of the Catholic
church, or at least half way, and that is to your Episcopal
meeting-house. O Baron! if you heard her fine counter-tenor
admonishing Kate and Matty in the morning, you, who understand
music, would tremble at the idea of hearing her shriek
in the psalmody of Haddo's Hole.''

  ``Lord forgie you, colonel, how ye rin on! But I hope your
honours will tak tea before ye gang to the palace, and I maun
gang, and mask it for you.''

  So saying, Mrs. Flockhart left the gentlemen to their own
conversation, which, as might be supposed, turned chiefly upon
the approaching events of the campaign.
