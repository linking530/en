	WAVERLEY PROCEEDS ON HIS JOURNEY.

  When Edward had collected his scattered recollection, he was
surprised to observe the cavern totally deserted. Having
arisen and put his dress in some order, he looked more accurately
round him; but all was still solitary. If it had not been
for the decayed brands of the fire, now sunk into grey ashes,
and the remnants of the festival, consisting of bones half burnt
and half gnawed, and an empty keg or two, there remained no
traces of Donald and his band. When Waverley sallied forth
to the entrance of the cave, he perceived that the point of rock,
on which remained the marks of last night's beacon, was accessible
by a small path, either natural, or roughly hewn in the
rock, along the little inlet of water which ran a few yards up
into the cavern, where, as in a wet-dock, the skiff which brought
him there the night before was still lying moored. When he
reached the small projecting platform on which the beacon had
been established, he would have believed his further progress
by land impossible, only that it was scarce probable but what
the inhabitants of the cavern had some mode of issuing from it
otherwise than by the lake. Accordingly, he soon observed
three or four shelving steps, or ledges of rock, at the very
extremity of the little platform; and, making use of them as a
staircase, he clambered by their means around the projecting
shoulder of the crag on which the cavern opened, and, descending
with some difficulty on the other side, he gained the wild
and precipitous shores of a Highland loch, about four miles in
length, and a mile and a half across, surrounded by heathy and
savage mountains, on the crests of which the morning mist was
still sleeping.

  Looking back to the place from which he came, he could
not help admiring the address which had adopted a retreat of
such seclusion and secrecy. The rock, round the shoulder of
which he had turned by a few imperceptible notches, that
barely afforded place for the foot, seemed, in looking back upon
it, a huge precipice, which barred all further passage by the
shores of the lake in that direction. There could be no possibility,
the breadth of the lake considered, of descrying the
entrance of the narrow and low-browed cave from the other side;
so that, unless the retreat had been sought for with boats, or
disclosed by treachery, it might be a safe and secret residence
to its garrison as long as they were supplied with provisions.
Having satisfied his curiosity in these particulars, Waverley
looked around for Evan Dhu and his attendants, who, he rightly
judged, would be at no great distance, whatever might have
become of Donald Bean Lean and his party, whose mode of life
was, of course, liable to sudden migrations of abode. Accordingly,
at the distance of about half-a-mile, he beheld a Highlander
(Evan apparently) angling in the lake, with another
attending him, whom, from the weapon which he shouldered,
he recognised for his friend with the battle-axe.

  Much nearer to the mouth of the cave, he heard the notes of
a lively Gaelic song, guided by which, in a sunny recess, shaded
by a glittering birch-tree, and carpeted with a bank of firm
white sand, he found the damsel of the cavern, whose lay had
already reached him, busy, to the best of her power, in arranging
to advantage a morning repast of milk, eggs, barley-bread, fresh
butter, and honey-comb. The poor girl had already made a
circuit of four miles that morning in search of the eggs, of the
meal which baked her cakes, and of the other materials of the
breakfast, being all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow
from distant cottagers. The followers of Donald Bean Lean
used little food except the flesh of the animals which they drove
away from the Lowlands; bread itself was a delicacy seldom
thought of, because hard to be obtained, and all the domestic
accommodations of milk, poultry, butter, etc., were out of the
question in this Scythian camp. Yet it must not be omitted,
that, although Alice had occupied a part of the morning in
providing those accommodations for her guest which the cavern
did not afford, she had secured time also to arrange her own
person in her best trim. Her finery was very simple. A short
russet-coloured jacket, and a petticoat, of scanty longitude, was
her whole dress; but these were clean, and neatly arranged.
A piece of scarlet embroidered cloth, called the _snood,_ confined
her hair, which fell over it in a profusion of rich dark curls.
The scarlet plaid, which formed part of her dress, was laid aside,
that it might not impede her activity in attending the stranger.
I should forget Alice's proudest ornament, were I to omit mentioning
a pair of gold ear-rings, and a golden rosary, which her
father (for she was the daughter of Donald Bean Lean) had
brought from France, the plunder, probably, of some battle or
storm.

  Her form, though rather large for her years, was very well
proportioned, and her demeanour had a natural and rustic grace,
with nothing of the sheepishness of an ordinary peasant. The
smiles, displaying a row of teeth of exquisite whiteness, and the
laughing eyes, with which, in dumb show, she gave Waverley
that morning greeting which she wanted English words to express,
might have been interpreted by a coxcomb, or perhaps by
a young soldier, who, without being such, was conscious of a
handsome person, as meant to convey more than the courtesy of
an hostess. Nor do I take it upon me to say, that the little wild
mountaineer would have welcomed any staid old gentleman advanced
in life, the Baron of Bradwardine, for example, with the
cheerful pains which she bestowed upon Edward's accommodation.
She seemed eager to place him by the meal which she had so
sedulously arranged, and to which she now added a few bunches
of cranberries, gathered in an adjacent morass. Having had the
satisfaction of seeing him seated at his breakfast, she placed
herself demurely upon a stone at a few yards' distance, and
appeared to watch with great complacency for some opportunity
of serving him.

  Evan and his attendant now returned slowly along the beach,
the latter bearing a large salmon-trout, the produce of the
morning's sport, together with the angling-rod, while Evan
strolled forward, with an easy, self-satisfied, and important gait,
towards the spot where Waverley was so agreeably employed at
the breakfast-table. After morning greetings had passed on
both sides, and Evan, looking at Waverley, had said something
in Gaelic to Alice, which made her laugh, yet colour up to her
eyes, through a complexion well embrowned by sun and wind,
Evan intimated his commands that the fish should be prepared
for breakfast. A spark from the lock of his pistol produced a
light, and a few withered fir branches were quickly in flame,
and as speedily reduced to hot embers, on which the trout was
broiled in large slices. To crown the repast, Evan produced
from the pocket of his short jerkin, a large scallop shell, and
from under the folds of his plaid, a ram's horn full of whisky.
Of this he took a copious dram, observing he had already taken
his _morning_ with Donald Bean Lean, before his departure; he
offered the same cordial to Alice and to Edward, which they
both declined. With the bounteous air of a lord, Evan then
proffered the scallop to Dugald Mahony, his attendant, who,
without waiting to be asked a second time, drank it off with
great gusto. Evan then prepared to move towards the boat,
inviting Waverley to attend him. Meanwhile, Alice had made
up in a small basket what she thought worth removing, and
flinging her plaid around her, she advanced up to Edward, and,
with the utmost simplicity, taking hold of his hand, offered her
cheek to his salute, dropping, at the same time, her little
courtesy. Evan, who was esteemed a wag among the mountain
fair, advanced, as if to secure a similar favour; but Alice,
snatching up her basket, escaped up the rocky bank as fleetly as
a roe, and, turning round and laughing, called something out to
him in Gaelic, which he answered in the same tone and language
then, waving her hand to Edward, she resumed her road, and
was soon lost among the thickets, though they continued for
some time to hear her lively carol, as she proceeded gaily on her
solitary journey.

  They now again entered the gorge of the cavern, and stepping
into the boat, the Highlander pushed off, and, taking advantage
of the morning breeze, hoisted a clumsy sort of sail, while Evan
assumed the helm, directing their course, as it appeared to
Waverley, rather higher up the lake than towards the place of
his embarkation on the preceding night. As they glided along
the silver mirror, Evan opened the conversation with a panegyric
upon Alice, who, he said, was both _canny and fendy;_ and was,
to the boot of all that, the best dancer of a strathspey in the
whole strath. Edward assented to her praises so far as he
understood them, yet could not help regretting that she was
condemned to such a perilous and dismal life.

  ``Oich! for that,'' said Evan, ``there is nothing in Perthshire
that she need want, if she ask her father to fetch it, unless it be
too hot or too heavy.''

  ``But to be the daughter of a cattle-stealer---a common thief!''

  ``Common thief!---no such thing; Donald Bean Lean never
_lifted_ less than a drove in his life.''

  ``Do you call him an uncommon thief, then?''

  ``No---he that steals a cow from a poor widow or a stirk from
a cotter is a thief; he that lifts a drove from a Sassenach laird
is a gentleman-drover. And, besides, to take a tree from the
forest, a salmon from the river, a deer from the hill, or a cow
from a Lowland strath, is what no Highlander need ever think
shame upon.''

  ``But what can this end in were he taken in such an appropriation?''

  ``To be sure he would _die for the law,_ as many a pretty man
has done before him.''

  ``Die for the law!''

  ``Ay; that is, with the law, or by the law; be strapped up
on the _kind_ gallows of Crieff,<*> where his father died, and his

* Note H. Kind Gallows of Crieff.<! p127>

goodsire died, and where I hope he'll live to die himsell, if he's
not shot or slashed in a creagh.''

  ``You _hope_ such a death for your friend, Evan!''

  ``And that do I e'en; would you have me wish him to die on
a bundle of wet straw in yon den of his, like a mangy tyke?''

  ``But what becomes of Alice, then?''

  ``Troth, if such an accident were to happen, as her father
would not need her help ony langer, I ken nought to hinder me
to marry her mysell.''

  ``Gallantly resolved!'' said Edward;---``but in the meanwhile,
Evan, what has your father-in-law (that shall be, if he have the
good fortune to be hanged) done with the Baron's cattle?''

  ``Oich,'' answered Evan, ``they were all trudging before your
lad and Allan Kennedy before the sun blinked ower Ben-Lawers
this morning; and they'll be in the pass of Bally-Brough by
this time, in their way back to the parks of Tully-Veolan, all
but two, that were unhappily slaughtered before I got last night
to Uaimh an Ri.''

  ``And where are we going, Evan, if I may be so bold as to
ask?'' said Waverley.

  ``Where would you be ganging, but to the laird's ain house
of Glennaquoich? Ye would not think to be in his country
without ganging to see him? It would be as much as a man's
life's worth.''

  ``And are we far from Glennaquoich?''

  ``But five bits of miles; and Vich Ian Vohr will meet us.''

  In about half an hour they reached the upper end of the lake,
where, after landing Waverley, the two Highlanders drew the
boat into a little creek among thick flags and reeds, where it lay
perfectly concealed. The oars they put in another place of concealment,
both for the use of Donald Bean Lean probably, when
his occasions should next bring him to that place.

  The travellers followed for some time a delightful opening
into the hills, down which a little brook found its way to the
lake. When they had pursued their walk a short distance,
Waverley renewed his questions about their host of the cavern.

  ``Does he always reside in that cave?''

  ``Out, no! it's past the skill of man to tell where he's to be
found at a' times; there's not a dern, nook, or cove, or corri, in
the whole country, that he's not acquainted with.''

  ``And do others beside your master shelter him?''

  ``My master?---_My_ master is in heaven,'' answered Evan
haughtily; and then immediately assuming his usual civility of
manner---``But you mean my Chief;---no, he does not shelter
Donald Bean Lean, nor any that are like him; he only allows
him (with a smile) wood and water.''

  ``No great boon, I should think, Evan, when both seem  to
be very plenty.''

  ``Ah! but ye dinna see through it. When I say wood and
water, I mean the loch and the land; and I fancy Donald would
be put till't if the laird were to look for him wi' threescore men
in the wood of Kailychat yonder; and if our boats, with a score
or twa mair, were to come down the loch to Uaimh an Ri,
headed by mysell, or ony other pretty man.''

  ``But suppose a strong party came against him from the Low
Country, would not your Chief defend him?''

  ``Na, he would not ware the spark of a flint for him---if they
came with the law.''

  ``And what must Donald do, then?''

  ``He behoved to rid this country of himself, and fall back, it
may be, over the mount upon Letter Scriven.''

  ``And if he were pursued to that place?''

  ``I'se warrant he would go to his cousin's at Rannoch.''

  ``Well, but if they followed him to Rannoch?''

  ``That,'' quoth Evan, ``is beyond all belief; and, indeed, to
tell you the truth, there durst not a Lowlander in all Scotland
follow the fray a gun-shot beyond Bally-Brough, unless he had
the help of the _Sidier Dhu._''

  ``Whom do you call so?''

  ``The _Sidier Dhu?_ the black soldier; that is what they call
the independent companies that were raised to keep peace
and law in the Highlands. Vich Ian Vohr commanded one of
them for five years, and I was sergeant myself, I shall warrant
ye. They call them _Sidier Dhu,_ because they wear the tartans
---as they call your men, King George's men, _Sidier Roy,_ or red
soldiers.''

  ``Well, but when you were in King George's pay, Evan, you
were surely King George's soldiers?''

  ``Troth, and you must ask Vich Ian Vohr about that; for
we are for his king, and care not much which of them it is.
At anyrate, nobody can say we are King George's men now,
when we have not seen his pay this twelvemonth.''

  This last argument admitted of no reply, nor did Edward
attempt any; he rather chose to bring back the discourse to
Donald Bean Lean. ``Does Donald confine himself to cattle,
or does he _lift,_ as you call it, anything else that comes in his
way ?''

  ``Troth, he's nae nice body, and he'll just tak' onything, but
most readily cattle, horse, or live Christians; for sheep are slow
of travel, and inside plenishing is cumbrous to carry, and not
easy to put away for siller in this country.''

  ``But does he carry off men and women?''

  ``Out, ay. Did not ye hear him speak o' the Perth bailie?
It cost that body five hundred merks ere he got to the south of
Bally-Brough. And ance Donald played a pretty sport.<*> There

* Note I. Caterans.<! p130>

was to be a blythe bridal between the Lady Cramfeezer, in the
howe o' the Mearns (she was the auld laird's widow, and no sae
young as she had been herself), and young Gilliewhackit, who
had spent his heirship and moveables, like a gentleman, at cock-matches,
bull-baitings, horse-races, and the like. Now, Donald
Bean Lean being aware that the bridegroom was in request, and
wanting to cleik the cunzie (that is, to hook the siller), he
cannily carried off Gilliewhackit ae night when he was riding
_dovering_ hame (wi' the malt rather abune the meal), and with
the help of his gillies he gat him into the hills with the speed
of light, and the first place he wakened in was the cove of
Uaimh an Ri. So there was old to do about ransoming the
bridegroom; for Donald would not lower a farthing of a thousand
punds''------

  ``The devil!''

  ``Punds Scottish, ye shall understand. And the lady had
not the siller if she had pawned her gown; and they applied to
the governor o' Stirling Castle, and to the major o' the Black
Watch; and the governor said, it was ower far to the northward,
and out of his district; and the major said, his men were
gane hame to the shearing, and he would not call them out
before the victual was got in for all the Cramfeezers in Christendom,
let alane the Mearns, for that it would prejudice the
country. And in the meanwhile yell no hinder Gilliewhackit
to take the small-pox. There was not the doctor in Perth or
Stirling would look near the poor lad; and I cannot blame
them, for Donald had been misguggled by ane of these doctors
about Paris, and he swore he would fling the first into the loch
that he catched beyond the Pass. However, some cailliachs
(that is, old women) that were about Donald's hand, nursed
Gilliewhackit sae weel, that between the free open air in the
cove and the fresh whey, deil an he did not recover may be as
weel as if he had been closed in a glazed chamber and a bed
with curtains, and fed with red wine and white meat. And
Donald was sae vexed about it, that when he was stout and
weel, he even sent him free home, and said he would be pleased
with onything they would like to gie him for the plague and
trouble which' he had about Gilliewhackit to an unkenn'd
degree. And I cannot tell ye precisely how they sorted; but
they agreed sae right that Donald was invited to dance at the
wedding in his Highland trews, and they said that there was
never sae mickle siller clinked in his purse either before or
since. And to the boot of all that, Gilliewhackit said, that, be
the evidence what it liked, if he had the luck to be on Donald's
inquest, he would bring him in guilty of nothing whatever,
unless it were wilful arson, or murder under trust.''

  With such bald and disjointed chat Evan went on, illustrating
the existing state of the Highlands, more perhaps to the amusement
of Waverley than that of our readers. At length, after
having marched over bank and brae, moss and heather, Edward,
though not unacquainted with the Scottish liberality in computing
distance, began to think that Evan's five miles were
nearly doubled. His observation on the large measure which
the Scottish allowed of their land, in comparison to the computation
of their money, was readily answered by Evan, with the,
old jest, ``The deil take them wha have the least pint stoup.''<*>

*   The Scotch are liberal in computing their land and liquor; the Scottish
* pint corresponds to two English quarts. As for their coin, every one knows
* the couplet---
*
*       ``How can the rogues pretend to sense?
* 	Their pound is only twenty pence.''


  And now the report of a gun was heard, and a sportsman
was seen, with his dogs and attendant, at the upper end of the
glen. ``Shough,'' said Dugald Mahony, ``tat's ta Chief.''

  ``It is not,'' said Evan imperiously. ``Do you think he
would come to meet a Sassenach Duinh<e'>-wassel in such a way
as that?''

  But as they approached a little nearer, he said, with an
appearance of mortification, ``And it is even he, sure enough;
and he has not his tail on after all;---there is no living creature
with him but Callum Beg.''

  In fact, Fergus Mac-Ivor, of whom a Frenchman might have
said, as truly as of any man in the Highlands, ``_Qu'il connoit
bien ses gens,_'' had no idea of raising himself in the eyes of an
English young man of fortune, by appearing with a retinue of
idle Highlanders disproportioned to the occasion. He was well
aware that such an unnecessary attendance would seem to
Edward rather ludicrous than respectable; and while few men
were more attached to ideas of chieftainship and feudal power,
he was, for that very reason, cautious of exhibiting external
marks of dignity, unless at the time and in the manner when
they were most likely to produce an imposing effect. Therefore,
although, had he been to receive a brother chieftain, he would
probably have been attended by all that retinue which Evan
described with so much unction, he judged it more respectable
to advance to meet Waverley with a single attendant, a very
handsome Highland boy, who carried his master's shooting-pouch
and his broadsword, without which he seldom went abroad.

  When Fergus and Waverley met, the latter was struck with
the peculiar grace and dignity of the Chieftain's figure. Above
the middle size, and finely proportioned, the Highland dress,
which he wore in its simplest mode, set off his person to great
advantage. He wore the trews, or close trowsers, made of
tartan, chequed scarlet and white; in other particulars, his dress
strictly resembled Evan's, excepting that he had no weapon save
a dirk, very richly mounted with silver. His page, as we have
said, carried his claymore; and the fowling-piece, which he held
in his hand, seemed only designed for sport. He had shot in
the course of his walk some young wild-ducks, as, though close-time
was then unknown, the broods of grouse were yet too young
for the sportsman. His countenance was decidedly Scottish,
with all the peculiarities of the northern physiognomy, but yet
had so little of its harshness and exaggeration, that it would
have been pronounced in any country extremely handsome.
The martial air of the bonnet, with a single eagle's feather as
a distinction, added much to the manly appearance of his head,
which was besides ornamented with a far more natural and
graceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed to
sale in Bond Street.

  An air of openness and affability increased the favourable
impression derived from this handsome and dignified exterior.
Yet a skilful physiognomist would have been less satisfied with
the countenance on the second than on the first view. The
eyebrow and upper lip bespoke something of the habit of peremptory
command and decisive superiority. Even his courtesy,
though open, frank, and unconstrained, seemed to indicate a
sense of personal importance; and, upon any check or accidental
excitation, a sudden, though transient, lour of the eye, showed
a hasty, haughty, and vindictive temper, not less to be dreaded
because it seemed much under its owner's command. In short,
the countenance of the Chieftain resembled a smiling summer,
day, in which, notwithstanding, we are made sensible by certain,
though slight signs, that it may thunder and lighten before the
close of evening.

  It was not, however, upon their first meeting that Edward
had an opportunity of making these less favourable remarks.
The Chief received him as a friend of the Baron of Bradwardine,
with the utmost expression of kindness, and obligation for
the visit; upbraided him gently with choosing so rude an abode
as he had done the night before; and entered into a lively
conversation with him about Donald Bean's housekeeping, but
without the least hint as to his predatory habits, or the immediate
occasion of Waverley's visit, a topic which, as the Chief
did not introduce it, our hero also avoided. While they walked
merrily on towards the house of Glennaquoich, Evan, who now
fell respectfully into the rear, followed with Callum Beg and
Dugald Mahony.

  We shall take the opportunity to introduce the reader to
some particulars of Fergus Mac-Ivor's character and history,
which were not completely known to Waverley till after a
connection, which, though arising from a circumstance so casual,
had for a length of time the deepest influence upon his character,
actions, and prospects. But this, being an important subject,
must form the commencement of a new chapter.
