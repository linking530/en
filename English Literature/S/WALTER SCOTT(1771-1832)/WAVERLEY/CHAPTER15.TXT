	A CREAGH,<*> AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

* A _creagh_ was an incursion for plunder, termed on the Borders a _raid._


  When Edward had been a guest at Tully-Veolan nearly six
weeks, he descried one morning, as he took his usual walk
before the breakfast-hour, signs of uncommon perturbation in
the family. Four bare-legged dairy-maids, with each an empty
milk-pail in her hand, ran about with frantic gestures, and
uttering loud exclamations of surprise, grief, and resentment.
From their appearance, a pagan might have conceived them a
detachment of the celebrated Belides, just come from their
baling penance. As nothing was to be got from this distracted
chorus, excepting ``Lord guide us!'' and ``Eh sirs!'' ejaculations
which threw no light upon the cause of their dismay,
Waverley repaired to the fore-court, as it was called, where he
beheld Bailie Macwheeble cantering his white pony down the
avenue with all the speed it could muster. He had arrived, it
would seem, upon a hasty summons, and was followed by half-a-score
of peasants from the village, who had no great difficulty
in keeping pace with him.

  The Bailie, greatly too busy, and too important, to enter into
explanations with Edward, summoned forth Mr. Saunderson,
who appeared with a countenance in which dismay was mingled
with solemnity, and they immediately entered into close conference.
Davie Gellatley was also seen in the group, idle as
Diogenes at Sinope, while his countrymen were preparing for
a siege. His spirits always rose with anything, good or bad,
which occasioned tumult, and he continued frisking, hopping,
dancing, and singing the burden of an old ballad,

	Our gear's a' gane,

until, happening to pass too near the Bailie, he received an
admonitory hint from his horse-whip, which converted his songs
into lamentation.

  Passing from thence towards the garden, Waverley beheld
the Baron in person, measuring and re-measuring, with swift
and tremendous strides, the length of the terrace; his countenance
clouded with offended pride and indignation, and the
whole of his demeanour such as seemed to indicate, that any
inquiry concerning the cause of his discomposure would give
pain at least, if not offence. Waverley therefore glided into
the house, without addressing him, and took his way to the
breakfast-parlour, where he found his young friend Rose, who,
though she neither exhibited the resentment of her father, the
turbid importance of Bailie Macwheeble, nor the despair of the
handmaidens, seemed vexed and thoughtful. A single word
explained the mystery. ``Your breakfast will be a disturbed
one, Captain Waverley. A party of Caterans have come down
upon us, last night, and have driven off all our milch cows.''

  ``A party of Caterans?''

  ``Yes; robbers from the neighbouring Highlands. We used
to be quite free from them while we paid black-mail to Fergus
Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr; but my father thought it unworthy
of his rank and birth to pay it any longer, and so this disaster
has happened. It is not the value of the cattle, Captain
Waverley, that vexes me; but my father is so much hurt at
the affront, and is so bold and hot, that I fear he will try to
recover them by the strong hand; and if he is not hurt himself,
he will hurt some of these wild people, and then there will be
no peace between them and us perhaps for our lifetime; and
we cannot defend ourselves as in old times, for the government
have taken all our arms; and my dear father is so rash---Oh,
what will become of us!''---Here poor Rose lost heart altogether,
and burst into a flood of tears.

  The Baron entered at this moment, and rebuked her with
more asperity than Waverley had ever heard him use to any
one. ``Was it not a shame,'' he said, ``that she should exhibit
herself before any gentleman in such a light, as if she shed tears
for a drove of horned nolt and milch kine, like the daughter of
a Cheshire yeoman; Captain Waverley, I must request your
favourable construction of her grief, which may, or ought to
proceed, solely from seeing her father's estate exposed to spulzie
and depredation from common thieves and sorners,<*> while we

*   _Sorners_ may be translated sturdy beggars, more especially indicating
* those unwelcome visitors who exact lodgings and victuals by force, or something
* approaching to it,

are not allowed to keep half-a-score of muskets, whether for
defence or rescue.''

  Bailie Macwheeble entered immediately afterwards, and by
his report of arms and ammunition confirmed this statement,
informing the Baron, in a melancholy voice, that though the
people would certainly obey his honour's orders, yet there was
no chance of their following the gear to ony guid purpose, in
respect there were only his honour's body servants who had
swords and pistols, and the depredators were twelve Highlanders,
completely armed after the manner of their country.---Having
delivered this doleful annunciation, he assumed a posture of
silent dejection, shaking his head slowly with the motion of a
pendulum when it is ceasing to vibrate, and then remained
stationary, his body stooping at a more acute angle than usual,
and the latter part of his person projecting in proportion.
The Baron, meanwhile, paced the room in silent indignation,
and at length fixing his eye upon an old portrait, whose person
was clad in armour, and whose features glared grimly out of a
huge bush of hair, part of which descended from his head to
his shoulders, and part from his chin and upper-lip to his
breast-plate,---``That gentleman, Captain Waverley, my grand-sire,''
he said, ``with two hundred horse, whom he levied within
his own bounds, discomfited and put to the rout more than five
hundred of these Highland reivers, who have been ever _lapis
offensionis, et petra scandali,_ a stumbling-block and a rock of
offence to the Lowland vicinage---he discomfited them, I say,
when they had the temerity to descend to harry this country
in the time of the civil dissensions, in the year of grace sixteen
hundred forty and two. And now, sir, I, his grandson, am
thus used at such unworthy hands!''

  Here there was an awful pause; after which all the company,
as is usual in cases of difficulty, began to give separate
and inconsistent counsel. Alexander ab Alexandro proposed
they should send some one to compound with the Caterans,
who would readily, he said, give up their prey for a dollar
a-head. The Bailie opined that this transaction would amount
to theft-boot, or composition of felony; and he recommended
that some _canny hand_ should be sent up to the glens to make
the best bargain he could, as it were for himself, so that the
laird might not be seen in such a transaction. Edward proposed
to send off to the nearest garrison for a party of soldiers
and a magistrate's warrant; and Rose, as far as she dared,
endeavoured to insinuate the course of paying the arrears of
tribute money to Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr, who, they
all knew, could easily procure restoration of the cattle, if he
were properly propitiated.

  None of these proposals met the Baron's approbation. The
idea of composition, direct or implied, was absolutely ignominious;
that of Waverley only showed that he did not understand
the state of the country, and of the political parties which
divided it; and, standing matters as they did with Fergus
Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr, the Baron would make no concession
to him, were it, he said, ``to procure restitution _in integrum_ of
every stirk and stot that the chief, his forefathers, and his clan,
had stolen since the days of Malcolm Canmore.''

  In fact, his voice was still for war, and he proposed to send
expresses to Balmawhapple, Killancureit, Tulliellum, and other
lairds, who were exposed to similar depredations, inviting them
to join in the pursuit; ``and then, sir, shall these _nebulones
nequissimi,_ as Lesl<ae>us calls them, be brought to the fate of
their predecessor Cacus.

       `Elisos oculos, et siccum sanguine guttur.' ''

  The Bailie, who by no means relished these warlike counsels,
here pulled forth an immense watch, of the colour, and nearly
of the size, of a pewter warming-pan, and observed it was now
past noon, and that the Caterans had been seen in the pass of
Bally-Brough soon after sunrise; so that before the allied forces
could assemble, they and their prey would be far beyond the
reach of the most active pursuit, and sheltered in those pathless
deserts where it was neither advisable to follow, nor indeed
possible to trace them.

  This proposition was undeniable. The council therefore broke
up without coming to any conclusion, as has occurred to councils
of more importance; only it was determined that the Bailie
should send his own three milk-cows down to the Mains for the
use of the Baron's family, and brew small ale, as a substitute
for milk, in his own. To this arrangement, which was suggested
by Saunderson, the Bailie readily assented, both from habitual
deference to the family, and an internal consciousness that his
courtesy would, in some mode or other, be repaid ten-fold.
The Baron having also retired to give some necessary directions,
Waverley seized the opportunity to ask, whether this
Fergus, with the unpronounceable name, was the chief thief-taker
of the district.

  ``Thief-taker!'' answered Rose, laughing; ``he is a gentle
man of great honour and consequence; the chieftain of an independent
branch of a powerful Highland clan, and is much
respected, both for his own power, and that of his kith, kin,
and allies.''

  ``And what has he to do with the thieves, then? is he a
magistrate, or in the commission of the peace?'' asked Waverley.

  ``The commission of war rather, if there be such a thing,''
said Rose; ``for he is a very unquiet neighbour to his un-friends,
and keeps a greater _following_ on foot than many that have
thrice his estate. As to his connection with the thieves, that I
cannot well explain; but the boldest of them will never steal a
hoof from any one that pays black-mail to Vich Ian Vohr.''

  ``And what is black-mail?''

  ``A sort of protection-money that Low-country gentlemen
and heritors, lying near the Highlands, pay to some Highland
chief, that he may neither do them harm himself, nor suffer it
to be done to them by others; and then, if your cattle are
stolen, you have only to send him word, and he will recover
them; or it may be, he will drive away cows from some distant
place, where he has a quarrel, and give them to you to make
up your loss.''

  ``And is this sort of Highland Jonathan Wild admitted into
society, and called a gentleman?''

  ``So much so,'' said Rose, ``that the quarrel between my
father and Fergus Mac-Ivor began at a county meeting, where
he wanted to take precedence of all the Lowland gentlemen
then present, only my father would not suffer it. And then he
upbraided my father that he was under his banner, and paid
him tribute; and my father was in a towering passion, for
Bailie Macwheeble, who manages such things his own way, had
contrived to keep this black-mail a secret from him, and passed
it in his account for cess-money. And they would have fought;
but Fergus Mac-Ivor said, very gallantly, he would never raise
his hand against a grey head that was so much respected as my
father's. Oh, I wish, I wish they had continued friends!''

  ``And did you ever see this Mr. Mac-Ivor, if that be his
name, Miss Bradwardine?''

  ``No, that is not his name; and he would consider _master_
as a sort of affront, only that you are an Englishman, and know
no better. But the Lowlanders call him, like other gentlemen,
by the name of his estate, Glennaquoich; and the Highlanders
call him Vich Ian Vohr, that is, the son of John the Great;
and we upon the braes here call him by both names indifferently.''

  ``I am afraid I shall never bring my English tongue to call
him by either one or other.''

  ``But he is a very polite, handsome man,'' continued Rose;
``and his sister Flora is one of the most beautiful and accomplished
young ladies in this country; she was bred in a convent
in France, and was a great friend of mine before this unhappy
dispute. Dear Captain Waverley, try your influence with my
father to make matters up. I am sure this is but the beginning
of our troubles; for Tully-Veolan has never been a safe or quiet
residence when we have been at feud with the Highlanders.
When I was a girl about ten, there was a skirmish fought
between a party of twenty of them, and my father and his
servants, behind the Mains; and the bullets broke several panes
in the north windows, they were so near. Three of the Highlanders
were killed, and they brought them in, wrapped in
their plaids, and laid them on the stone floor of the hall; and
next morning, their wives and daughters came, clapping their
hands, and crying the coronach, and shrieking, and carried
away the dead bodies, with the pipes playing before them. I
could not sleep for six weeks without starting, and thinking I
heard these terrible cries, and saw the bodies lying on the steps,
all stiff and swathed up in their bloody tartans. But since that
time there came a party from the garrison at Stirling, with a
warrant from the Lord Justice-Clerk, or some such great man,
and took away all our arms; and now, how are we to protect
ourselves if they come down in any strength?''

  Waverley could not help starting at a story which bore so
much resemblance to one of his own day-dreams. Here was a
girl scarce seventeen, the gentlest of her sex, both in temper
and appearance, who had witnessed with her own eyes such a
scene as he had used to conjure up in his imagination, as only
occurring in ancient times, and spoke of it coolly, as one very
likely to recur. He felt at once the impulse of curiosity, and
that slight sense of danger which only serves to heighten its
interest. He might have said with Malvolio, `` `I do not now
fool myself, to let imagination jade me!' I am actually in the
land of military and romantic adventures, and it only remains
to be seen what will be my own share in them.''

  The whole circumstances now detailed concerning the State
of the country, seemed equally novel and extraordinary. He
had indeed often heard of Highland thieves, but had no idea
of the systematic mode in which their depredations were conducted;
and that the practice was connived at, and even encouraged
by, many of the Highland chieftains, who not only
found the creaghs, or forays, useful for the purpose of training
individuals of their clan to the practice of arms, but also of
maintaining a wholesome terror among their Lowland neighbours,
and levying, as we have seen, a tribute from them, under
colour of protection-money.

  Bailie Macwheeble, who soon afterwards entered, expatiated
still more at length upon the same topic. This honest gentleman's
conversation was so formed upon his professional practice,
that Davie Gellatley once said his discourse was like ``a charge
of horning.'' He assured our hero, that ``from the maist
ancient times of record, the lawless thieves, limmers, and broken
men of the Highlands, had been in fellowship together by reason
of their surnames, for the committing of divers thefts, reifs, and
herships upon the honest men of the Low Country, when they
not only intromitted with their whole goods and gear, corn,
cattle, horse, nolt, sheep, outsight and insight plenishing, at their
wicked pleasure, but moreover made prisoners, ransomed them,
or concussed them into giving borrows (pledges) to enter into
captivity again: all which was directly prohibited in divers
parts of the Statute Book, both by the act one thousand five
hundred and sixty-seven, and various others; the whilk statutes,
with all that had followed and might follow thereupon, were
shamefully broken and vilipended by the said sorners, limmers,
and broken men, associated into fellowships, for the aforesaid
purposes of theft, stouthreef, fire-raising, murther, raptus mulierum,
or forcible abduction of women, and such like as aforesaid.''

  It seemed like a dream to Waverley that these deeds of
violence should be familiar to men's minds, and currently
talked of, as falling within the common order of things, and
happening daily in the immediate vicinity, without his having
crossed the seas, and while he was yet in the otherwise well-ordered
island of Great Britain.<*>
