	A wise physician, skill'd our wounds to heal,
	Is more than armies to the common weal.
					Pope's Iliad.


  ``This is a strange tale, Sir Thomas,'' said the sick monarch,
when he had heard the report of the trusty Baron of Gilsland;
``art thou sure this Scotchman is a tall man and true?''

  ``I cannot say, my lord,'' replied the jealous Borderer; ``I
live a little too near the Scots to gather much truth among
them, having found them ever fair and false. But this man's
bearing is that of a true man, were he a devil as well as a Scot
---that I must needs say for him in conscience.''

  ``And for his carriage as a knight, how say'st thou, De Vaux?''
demanded the King.

  ``It is your Majesty's business more than mine to note men's
bearings; and I warrant you have noted the manner in which
this man of the Leopard hath borne himself. He hath been well
spoken of.''

  ``And justly, Thomas,'' said the King. ``We have ourselves
witnessed him. It is indeed our purpose, in placing ourselves
ever in the front of battle, to see how our liegemen and followers
acquit themselves, and not from a desire to accumulate
vainglory to ourselves, as some have supposed. We know the
vanity of the praise of man, which is but a vapour, and buckle
on our armour for other purposes than to win it.''

  De Vaux was alarmed when he heard the King make a declaration
so inconsistent with his nature, and believed at first
that nothing short of the approach of death could have brought
him to speak in depreciating terms of military renown, which
was the very breath of his nostrils. But recollecting he had
met the royal confessor in the outer pavilion, he was shrewd
enough to place this temporary self-abasement to the effect of
the reverend man's lesson, and suffered the King to proceed
without reply.

  ``Yes,'' continued Richard, ``I have indeed marked the manner
in which this knight does his devoir. My leading-staff were not
worth a fool's bauble, had he escaped my notice---and he had
ere now tasted of our bounty, but that I have also marked his
overweening and audacious presumption.''

  ``My liege,'' said the Baron of Gilsland, observing the King's
countenance change, ``I fear I have transgressed your pleasure
in lending some countenance to his transgression.''

  ``How, De Multon, thou?'' said the King, contracting his
brows, and speaking in a tone of angry surprise,---``Thou countenance
his insolence?---It cannot be.''

  ``Nay, your Majesty will pardon me to remind you, that I
have by mine office right to grant liberty to men of gentle blood,
to keep them a hound or two within the camp, just to cherish
the noble art of venerie; and besides, it were a sin to have
maimed or harmed a thing so noble as this gentleman's dog.''

  ``Has he then a dog so handsome?'' said the King.

  ``A most perfect creature of Heaven,'' said the baron, who
was an enthusiast in field-sports---``of the noblest Northern
breed---deep in the chest, strong in the stern, black colour, and
brindled on the breast and legs, not spotted with white, but
just shaded into grey---strength to pull down a bull---swiftness
to cote an antelope.''

  The King laughed at his enthusiasm. ``Well, thou hast
given him leave to keep the hound, so there is an end of it.
Be not, however, liberal of your licences among those knights
adventurers, who have no prince or leader to depend upon---they
are ungovernable, and leave no game in Palestine.---But to this
piece of learned heathenesse---say'st thou the Scot met him in
the desert?''

  ``No, my liege, the Scot's tale runs thus:---He was despatched
to the old hermit of Engaddi, of whom men talk so
much''------

  ``'Sdeath and hell!'' said Richard, starting up, ``by whom
despatched, and for what? Who dared send any one thither,
when our Queen was in the Convent of Engaddi, upon her
pilgrimage for our recovery?''

  ``The Council of the Crusade sent him, my lord,'' answered
the Baron de Vaux; ``for what purpose he declined to account
to me. I think it is scarce known in the camp that your royal
consort is on a pilgrimage---and even the princes may not have
been aware, as the Queen has been sequestered from company
since your love prohibited her attendance in case of infection.''

  ``Well, it shall be looked into,'' said Richard.---``So this
Scotsman, this envoy, met with a wandering physician at
the grotto of Engaddi---ha?''

  ``Not so, my liege,'' replied De Vaux; ``but he met, I think,
near that place, with a Saracen Emir, with whom he had some
m<e^>l<e'>e in the way of proof of valour, and finding him worthy to
bear brave men company, they went together, as errant knights
are wont, to the grotto of Engaddi.''

  Here De Vaux stopped, for he was not one of those who can
tell a long story in a sentence.

  ``And did they there meet the physician?'' demanded the
King, impatiently.

  ``No, my liege,'' replied De Vaux; ``but the Saracen, learning
your Majesty's grievous illness, undertook that Saladin should
send his own physician to you, and with many assurances of
his eminent skill; and he came to the grotto accordingly, after
the Scottish Knight had tarried a day for him and more. He
is attended as if he were a prince, with drums and atabals,
and servants on horse and foot, and brings with him letters of
credence from Saladin.''

  ``Have they been examined by Giacomo Loredani?''

  ``I showed them to the interpreter ere bringing them hither,
and behold their contents in English.''

  Richard took a scroll, in which were inscribed these words:
---``The blessing of Allah and his Prophet Mahommed, [`Out
upon the hound!' said Richard, spitting in contempt, by way
of interjection;] Saladin, king of kings, Soldan of Egypt and
of Syria, the light and refuge of the earth, to the great Melech
Ric, Richard of England, greeting. Whereas, we have been
informed that the hand of sickness hath been heavy upon thee,
our royal brother, and that thou hast with thee only such
Nazarene and Jewish mediciners, as work without the blessing
of Allah and our holy Prophet [`Confusion on his head!' again
muttered the English monarch], we have therefore sent to tend
and wait upon thee at this time, the physician to our own person,
Adonbec el Hakim, before whose face the angel Azrael<*> spreads

* The Angel of Death.

his wings and departs from the sick chamber; who knows the
virtues of herbs and stones, the path of the sun, moon, and stars,
and can save man from all that is not written on his forehead.
And this we do, praying you heartily to honour and make use
of his skill; not only that we may do service to thy worth and
valour, which is the glory of all the nations of Frangistan, but
that we may bring the controversy which is at present between
us to an end, either by honourable agreement, or by open trial
thereof with our weapons, in a fair field ; seeing that it neither
becomes thy place and courage, to die the death of a slave who
hath been overwrought by his taskmaster, nor befits it our fame
that a brave adversary be snatched from our weapon by such a
disease. And, therefore, may the holy''------

  ``Hold, hold,'' said Richard, ``I will have no more of his
dog of a Prophet! It makes me sick to think the valiant and
worthy Soldan should believe in a dead dog.---Yes, I will see
his physician. I will put myself into the charge of this Hakim
---I will repay the noble Soldan his generosity---I will meet
Saladin in the field, as he so worthily proposes, and he shall
have no cause to term Richard of England ungrateful. I will
strike him to the earth with my battle-axe---I will convert him
to Holy Church with such blows as he has rarely endured---He
shall recant his errors before my good cross-handled sword, and
I will have him baptized in the battlefield, from my own helmet,
though the cleansing waters were mixed with the blood of us
both.---Haste, De Vaux, why dost thou delay a conclusion so
pleasing? Fetch the Hakim hither.''

  ``My lord,'' said the baron, who perhaps saw some accession
of fever in this overflow of confidence,---``bethink you, the Soldan
is a pagan, and that you are his most formidable enemy''------

  ``For which reason he is the more bound to do me service in
this matter, lest a paltry fever end the quarrel betwixt two
such kings. I tell thee, he loves me as I love him---as noble
adversaries ever love each other---by my honour, it were sin to
doubt his good faith!''

  ``Nevertheless, my lord, it were well to wait the issue of
those medicines upon the Scottish squire,'' said the Lord of
Gilsland; ``my own life depends upon it, for worthy were I to
die like a dog, did I proceed rashly in this matter, and make
shipwreck of the weal of Christendom.''

  ``I never knew thee before hesitate for fear of life,'' said
Richard, upbraidingly.

  ``Nor would I now, my liege,'' replied the stouthearted baron,
``save that yours lies at pledge as well as my own.''

  ``Well, thou suspicious mortal,'' answered Richard, ``begone
then, and watch the progress of this remedy. I could almost
wish it might either cure or kill me, for I am weary of lying
here like an ox dying of the murrain, when tambours are beating,
horses stamping, and trumpets sounding without.''

  The Baron hastily departed, resolved, however, to communicate
his errand to some churchman, as he felt something
burdened in conscience at the idea of his master being attended
by an unbeliever.

  The Archbishop of Tyre was the first to whom he confided
his doubts, knowing his interest with his master, Richard, who
both loved and honoured that sagacious prelate. The bishop
heard the doubts which De Vaux stated, with that acuteness
of intelligence which distinguishes the Roman Catholic clergy.
The religious scruples of De Vaux he treated with as much
lightness as propriety permitted him to exhibit on such a subject
to a layman.

  ``Mediciners,'' he said, ``like the medicines which they employed,
were often useful, though the one were by birth or
manners the vilest of humanity, as the others are, in many
cases, extracted from the basest materials. Men may use the
assistance of pagans and infidels,'' he continued, ``in their need,
and there is reason to think, that one cause of their being permitted
to remain on earth, is that they might minister to the
convenience of true Christians---Thus, we lawfully make slaves
of heathen captives.---Again,'' proceeded the prelate, ``there is
no doubt that the primitive Christians used the services of the
unconverted heathen---thus, in the ship of Alexandria, in which
the blessed Apostle Paul sailed to Italy, the sailors were doubtless
pagans; yet what said the holy saint when their ministry
was needful---`_Nisi hi in navi manserint, vos salvi fieri non potestis_
---Unless these men abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.'
Again, Jews are infidels to Christianity, as well as Mahommedans.
But there are few physicians in the camp excepting
Jews, and such are employed without scandal or scruple. Therefore,
Mahommedans may be used for their service in that capacity
---_quod erat demonstrandum._''

  This reasoning entirely removed the scruples of Thomas de
Vaux, who was particularly moved by the Latin quotation, as
he did not understand a word of it.

  But the bishop proceeded with far less fluency, when he considered
the possibility of the Saracen's acting with bad faith;
and here he came not to a speedy decision. The baron showed
him the letters of credence. He read and re-read them, and
compared the original with the translation.

  ``It is a dish choicely cooked,'' he said, ``to the palate of
King Richard, and I cannot but have my suspicions of the
wily Saracen. They are curious in the art of poisons, and can
so temper them that they shall be weeks in acting upon the
party, during which time the perpetrator has leisure to escape.
They can impregnate cloth and leather, nay, even paper and
parchment, with the most subtle venom---Our Lady forgive
me!---And wherefore, knowing this, hold I these letters of
credence so close to my face?---Take them, Sir Thomas, take
them speedily.''

  Here he gave them at arm's-length, and with some appearance
of haste, to the baron, ``But come, my Lord de Vaux,''
he continued, ``wend we to the tent of this sick squire, where
we shall learn whether this Hakim hath really the art of curing
which he professeth, ere we consider whether there be safety in
permitting him to exercise his art upon King Richard.---Yet
hold! let me first take my pouncet-box, for these fevers spread
like an infection. I would advise you to use dried rosemary
steeped in vinegar, my lord. I, too, know something of the
healing art.''

  ``I thank your reverend lordship,'' replied Thomas of Gilsland;
``but had I been accessible to the fever, I had caught it
long since by the bed of my master.''

  The Bishop of Tyre blushed, for he had rather avoided the
presence of the sick monarch; and he bid the baron lead on.

  As they paused before the wretched hut in which Kenneth
of the Leopard and his follower abode, the bishop said to De
Vaux, ``Now, of a surety, my lord, these Scottish knights have
worse care of their followers than we of our dogs. Here is a
knight, valiant they say in battle, and thought fitting to be
graced with charges of weight in time of truce, whose esquire
of the body is lodged worse than in the worst dog-kennel in
England. What say you of your neighbours?''

  ``That a master doth well enough for his servant, when he
lodgeth him in no worse dwelling than his own,'' said De Vaux,
and entered the hut.

  The bishop followed, not without evident reluctance; for
though he lacked not courage in some respects, yet it was
tempered with a strong and lively regard for his own safety.
He recollected, however, the necessity there was for judging
personally of the skill of the Arabian physician, and entered
the hut with a stateliness of manner, calculated, as he thought,
to impose respect on the stranger.

  The prelate was, indeed, a striking and commanding figure.
In his youth he had been eminently handsome, and, even in
age, was unwilling to appear less so. His episcopal dress was
of the richest fashion, trimmed with costly fur, and surrounded
by a cope of curious needle-work. The rings on his fingers
were worth a goodly barony, and the hood which he wore, though
now unclasped and thrown back for heat, had studs of pure gold
to fasten it around his throat, and under his chin when he so
inclined. His long beard, now silvered with age, descended
over his breast. One of two youthful acolytes who attended
him, created an artificial shade, peculiar then to the East, by
bearing over his head an umbrella of palmetto leaves, while the
other refreshed his reverend master by agitating a fan of peacock
feathers.

  When the Bishop of Tyre entered the hut of the Scottish
knight, the master was absent; and the Moorish physician,
whom he had come to see, sat in the very posture in which De
Vaux had left him several hours before, cross-legged upon a
mat made of twisted leaves, by the side of the patient, who
appeared in deep slumber, and whose pulse he felt from time
to time. The bishop remained standing before him in silence
for two or three minutes, as if expecting some honourable
salutation, or at least that the Saracen would seem struck with
the dignity of his appearance. But Adonbec el Hakim took no
notice of him beyond a passing glance, and when the prelate at
length saluted him in the Lingua Franca current in the country,
he only replied by the ordinary Oriental greeting, ``_Salam
alicum_---peace be with you.''

  ``Art thou a physician, infidel?'' said the bishop, somewhat
mortified at this cold reception. ``I would speak with thee on
that art.''

  ``If thou knewest aught of medicine,'' answered El Hakim,
``thou wouldst be aware that physicians hold no counsel or
debate in the sick chamber of their patient. Hear,'' he added,
as the low growling of the stag-hound was heard from the
inner hut, ``even the dog might teach thee reason, Ulemat.
His instinct teaches him to suppress his barking in the sick
man's hearing.---Come without the tent,'' said he, rising and
leading the way, ``if thou hast aught to say with me.''

  Notwithstanding the plainness of the Saracen leech's dress,
and his inferiority of size, when contrasted with the tall prelate
and gigantic English baron, there was something striking in
his manner and countenance, which prevented the Bishop of
Tyre from expressing strongly the displeasure he felt at this
unceremonious rebuke. When without the hut, he gazed upon
Adonbec in silence, for several minutes, before he could fix
on the best manner to renew the conversation. No locks were
seen under the high bonnet of the Arabian, which hid also
part of a brow that seemed lofty and expanded, smooth, and
free from wrinkles, as were his cheeks, where they were seen
under the shade of his long beard. We have elsewhere noticed
the piercing quality of his dark eyes.

  The prelate, struck with his apparent youth, at length broke
a pause, which the other seemed in no haste to interrupt, by
demanding of the Arabian how old he was.

  ``The years of ordinary men,'' said the Saracen, ``are
counted by their wrinkles; those of sages by their studies. I
dare not call myself older than a hundred revolutions of the
Hegira.''<*>

*   Meaning, that his attainments were those which might have been made
* in a hundred years.


  The Baron of Gilsland, who took this for a literal assertion
that he was a century old, looked doubtfully upon the prelate,
who, though he better understood the meaning of El Hakim,
answered his glance by mysteriously shaking his head. He
resumed an air of importance, when he again authoritatively
demanded, what evidence Adonbec could produce of his medical
proficiency.

  ``Ye have the word of the mighty Saladin,'' said the sage,
touching his cap in sign of reverence; ``a word which was
never broken towards friend or foe---what, Nazarene, wouldst
thou demand more?''

  ``I would have ocular proof of thy skill,'' said the baron,
``and without it thou approachest not to the couch of King
Richard.''

  ``The praise of the physician,'' said the Arabian, ``is in the
recovery of his patient. Behold this sergeant, whose blood has
been dried up by the fever which has whitened your camp with
skeletons, and against which the art of your Nazarene leeches
hath been like a silken doublet against a lance of steel. Look
at his fingers and arms, wasted like the claws and shanks of
the crane. Death had this morning his clutch on him; but
had Azrael been on one side of the couch, I being on the other,
his soul should not have been reft from his body. Disturb me
not with further questions, but await the critical minute, and
behold in silent wonder the marvellous event.''

  The physician had then recourse to his astrolabe, the oracle
of Eastern science, and, watching with grave precision until the
precise time of the evening prayer had arrived, he sunk on his
knees, with his face turned to Mecca, and recited the petitions
which close the Moslemah's day of toil. The bishop and the
English baron looked on each other, meanwhile, with symptoms
of contempt and indignation, but neither judged it fit to
interrupt El Hakim in his devotions, unholy as they considered
them to be.

  The Arab arose from the earth, on which he had prostrated
himself, and, walking into the hut where the patient lay extended,
he drew a sponge from a small silver box, dipt perhaps in some
aromatic distillation; for when he put it to the sleeper's nose,
he sneezed, awoke, and looked wildly around. He was a ghastly
spectacle, as he sat up almost naked on his couch, the bones and
cartilages as visible through the surface of his skin as if they
had never been clothed with flesh; his face was long and furrowed
with wrinkles, but his eye, though it wandered at first, became
gradually more settled. He seemed to be aware of the presence
of his dignified visitors, for he attempted feebly to pull the
covering from his head, in token of reverence, as he inquired, in
a subdued and submissive voice, for his master.

  ``Do you know us, vassal?'' said the Lord of Gilsland.

  ``Not perfectly, my lord,'' replied the Squire, faintly. ``My
sleep has been long and full of dreams. Yet I know that you
are a great English lord, as seemeth by the red cross, and this a
holy prelate, whose blessing I crave on me a poor sinner.''

  ``Thou hast it---_Benedictio Domini sit vobiscum,_'' said the
prelate, making the sign of the cross, but without approaching
nearer to the patient's bed.

  ``Your eyes witness,'' said the Arabian, ``the fever hath been
subdued---he speaks with calmness and recollection---his pulse
beats composedly as yours---try its pulsations yourself.''

  The prelate declined the experiment; but Thomas of Gilsland,
more determined on making the trial, did so, and satisfied
himself that the fever was indeed gone.

  ``This is most wonderful,'' said the knight, looking to the
bishop; ``the man is assuredly cured. I must conduct this
mediciner presently to King Richard's tent---What thinks your
reverence?''

  ``Stay, let me finish one cure ere I commence another,'' said
the Arab; ``I will pass with you when I have given my patient
the second cup of this most holy elixir.''

  So saying he pulled out a silver cup, and filling it with water
from a gourd which stood by the bedside, he next drew forth a
small silken bag made of network, twisted with silver, the contents
of which the bystanders could not discover, and immersing
it in the cup, continued to watch it in silence during the space
of five minutes. It seemed to the spectators as if some effervescence
took place during the operation, but if so, it instantly
subsided.

  ``Drink,'' said the physician to the sick man---``sleep, and
awaken free from malady.''

  ``And with this simple-seeming draught, thou wilt undertake
to cure a monarch?'' said the Bishop of Tyre.

  ``I have cured a beggar, as you may behold,'' replied the
sage. ``Are the kings of Frangistan made of other clay than
the meanest of their subjects?''

  ``Let us have him presently to the King,'' said the Baron of
Gilsland. ``He hath shown that he possesses the secret which
may restore his health. If he fails to exercise it, I will put
himself past the power of medicine.''

  As they were about to leave the hut, the sick man, raising his
voice as much as his weakness permitted, exclaimed, ``Reverend
father, noble knight, and you, kind leech, if you would have me
sleep and recover, tell me in charity what has become of my
dear master?''

  ``He is upon a distant expedition, friend,'' replied the prelate;
``on an honourable embassy, which may detain him for
some days.''

  ``Nay,'' said the Baron of Gilsland, ``why deceive the poor
fellow?---Friend, they master has returned to the camp, and you
will presently see him.''

  The invalid held up, as if in thankfulness, his wasted hands
to Heaven, and, resisting no longer the soporiferous operation of
the elixir, sunk down in a gentle sleep.

  ``You are a better physician than I, Sir Thomas,'' said the
prelate; ``a soothing falsehood is fitter for a sick room than an
unpleasing truth.''

  ``How mean you, my reverend lord?'' said De Vaux, hastily.
``Think you I would tell a falsehood to save the lives of a dozen
such as he?''

  ``You said,'' replied the bishop, with manifest symptoms of
alarm---``you said, the esquire's master was returned---he, I
mean, of the Couchant Leopard.''

  ``And he _is_ returned,'' said De Vaux. ``I spoke with him but
a few hours since. This learned leech came in his company.''

  ``Holy Virgin! why told you not of his return to me?'' said
the bishop, in evident perturbation.

  ``Did I not say that this same Knight of the Leopard had
returned in company with the physician?---I thought I had,''
replied De Vaux, carelessly; ``but what signified his return to
the skill of the physician, or the cure of his Majesty?''

  ``Much, Sir Thomas---it signified much,'' said the bishop,
clenching his hands, pressing his foot against the earth, and
giving signs of impatience, as if in an involuntary manner.

  ``But, where can he be gone now, this same knight?---God be
with us---here may be some fatal errors!''

  ``Yonder serf in the outer space,'' said De Vaux, not without
wonder at the bishop's emotion, ``can probably tell us whither
his master has gone.''

  The lad was summoned, and, in a language nearly incomprehensible
to them, gave them at length to understand, that an
officer had summoned his master to the royal tent, some time
before their arrival at that of his master. The anxiety of the
bishop appeared to rise to the highest, and became evident to
De Vaux, though neither an acute observer, nor of a suspicious
temper. But with his anxiety seemed to increase his wish to
keep it subdued and unobserved. He took a hasty leave of
De Vaux, who looked after him with astonishment; and, after
shrugging up his shoulders in silent wonder, proceeded to conduct
he Arabian physician to the tent of King Richard.
