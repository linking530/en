To Sir Percy Florence and Lady Shelley



Here is a tale which extends over many years and travels into many

countries.  By a peculiar fitness of circumstance the writer began,

continued it, and concluded it among distant and diverse scenes.

Above all, he was much upon the sea.  The character and fortune of

the fraternal enemies, the hall and shrubbery of Durrisdeer, the

problem of Mackellar's homespun and how to shape it for superior

flights; these were his company on deck in many star-reflecting

harbours, ran often in his mind at sea to the tune of slatting

canvas, and were dismissed (something of the suddenest) on the

approach of squalls.  It is my hope that these surroundings of its

manufacture may to some degree find favour for my story with

seafarers and sea-lovers like yourselves.



And at least here is a dedication from a great way off:  written by

the loud shores of a subtropical island near upon ten thousand

miles from Boscombe Chine and Manor:  scenes which rise before me

as I write, along with the faces and voices of my friends.



Well, I am for the sea once more; no doubt Sir Percy also.  Let us

make the signal B. R. D.!
