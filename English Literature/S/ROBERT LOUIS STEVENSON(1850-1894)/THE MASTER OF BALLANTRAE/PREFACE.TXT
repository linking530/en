Although an old, consistent exile, the editor of the following

pages revisits now and again the city of which he exults to be a

native; and there are few things more strange, more painful, or

more salutary, than such revisitations.  Outside, in foreign spots,

he comes by surprise and awakens more attention than he had

expected; in his own city, the relation is reversed, and he stands

amazed to be so little recollected.  Elsewhere he is refreshed to

see attractive faces, to remark possible friends; there he scouts

the long streets, with a pang at heart, for the faces and friends

that are no more.  Elsewhere he is delighted with the presence of

what is new, there tormented by the absence of what is old.

Elsewhere he is content to be his present self; there he is smitten

with an equal regret for what he once was and for what he once

hoped to be.



He was feeling all this dimly, as he drove from the station, on his

last visit; he was feeling it still as he alighted at the door of

his friend Mr. Johnstone Thomson, W.S., with whom he was to stay.

A hearty welcome, a face not altogether changed, a few words that

sounded of old days, a laugh provoked and shared, a glimpse in

passing of the snowy cloth and bright decanters and the Piranesis

on the dining-room wall, brought him to his bed-room with a

somewhat lightened cheer, and when he and Mr. Thomson sat down a

few minutes later, cheek by jowl, and pledged the past in a

preliminary bumper, he was already almost consoled, he had already

almost forgiven himself his two unpardonable errors, that he should

ever have left his native city, or ever returned to it.



"I have something quite in your way," said Mr. Thomson.  "I wished

to do honour to your arrival; because, my dear fellow, it is my own

youth that comes back along with you; in a very tattered and

withered state, to be sure, but - well! - all that's left of it."



"A great deal better than nothing," said the editor.  "But what is

this which is quite in my way?"



"I was coming to that," said Mr. Thomson:  "Fate has put it in my

power to honour your arrival with something really original by way

of dessert.  A mystery."



"A mystery?" I repeated.



"Yes," said his friend, "a mystery.  It may prove to be nothing,

and it may prove to be a great deal.  But in the meanwhile it is

truly mysterious, no eye having looked on it for near a hundred

years; it is highly genteel, for it treats of a titled family; and

it ought to be melodramatic, for (according to the superscription)

it is concerned with death."



"I think I rarely heard a more obscure or a more promising

annunciation," the other remarked.  "But what is It?"



"You remember my predecessor's, old Peter M'Brair's business?"



"I remember him acutely; he could not look at me without a pang of

reprobation, and he could not feel the pang without betraying it.

He was to me a man of a great historical interest, but the interest

was not returned."



"Ah well, we go beyond him," said Mr. Thomson.  "I daresay old

Peter knew as little about this as I do.  You see, I succeeded to a

prodigious accumulation of old law-papers and old tin boxes, some

of them of Peter's hoarding, some of his father's, John, first of

the dynasty, a great man in his day.  Among other collections, were

all the papers of the Durrisdeers."



"The Durrisdeers!" cried I.  "My dear fellow, these may be of the

greatest interest.  One of them was out in the '45; one had some

strange passages with the devil - you will find a note of it in

Law's MEMORIALS, I think; and there was an unexplained tragedy, I

know not what, much later, about a hundred years ago - "



"More than a hundred years ago," said Mr. Thomson.  "In 1783."



"How do you know that?  I mean some death."



"Yes, the lamentable deaths of my Lord Durrisdeer and his brother,

the Master of Ballantrae (attainted in the troubles)," said Mr.

Thomson with something the tone of a man quoting.  "Is that it?"



"To say truth," said I, "I have only seen some dim reference to the

things in memoirs; and heard some traditions dimmer still, through

my uncle (whom I think you knew).  My uncle lived when he was a boy

in the neighbourhood of St. Bride's; he has often told me of the

avenue closed up and grown over with grass, the great gates never

opened, the last lord and his old maid sister who lived in the back

parts of the house, a quiet, plain, poor, hum-drum couple it would

seem - but pathetic too, as the last of that stirring and brave

house - and, to the country folk, faintly terrible from some

deformed traditions."



"Yes," said Mr. Thomson.  "Henry Graeme Durie, the last lord, died

in 1820; his sister, the honourable Miss Katherine Durie, in '27;

so much I know; and by what I have been going over the last few

days, they were what you say, decent, quiet people and not rich.

To say truth, it was a letter of my lord's that put me on the

search for the packet we are going to open this evening.  Some

papers could not be found; and he wrote to Jack M'Brair suggesting

they might be among those sealed up by a Mr. Mackellar.  M'Brair

answered, that the papers in question were all in Mackellar's own

hand, all (as the writer understood) of a purely narrative

character; and besides, said he, 'I am bound not to open them

before the year 1889.'  You may fancy if these words struck me:  I

instituted a hunt through all the M'Brair repositories; and at last

hit upon that packet which (if you have had enough wine) I propose

to show you at once."



In the smoking-room, to which my host now led me, was a packet,

fastened with many seals and enclosed in a single sheet of strong

paper thus endorsed:





Papers relating to the lives and lamentable deaths of the late Lord

Durisdeer, and his elder brother James, commonly called Master of

Ballantrae, attainted in the troubles:  entrusted into the hands of

John M'Brair in the Lawnmarket of Edinburgh, W.S.; this 20th day of

September Anno Domini 1789; by him to be kept secret until the

revolution of one hundred years complete, or until the 20th day of

September 1889:  the same compiled and written by me, EPHRAIM

MACKELLAR,



For near forty years Land Steward on the estates of his Lordship.





As Mr. Thomson is a married man, I will not say what hour had

struck when we laid down the last of the following pages; but I

will give a few words of what ensued.



"Here," said Mr. Thomson, "is a novel ready to your hand:  all you

have to do is to work up the scenery, develop the characters, and

improve the style."



"My dear fellow," said I, "they are just the three things that I

would rather die than set my hand to.  It shall be published as it

stands."



"But it's so bald," objected Mr. Thomson.



"I believe there is nothing so noble as baldness," replied I, "and

I am sure there in nothing so interesting.  I would have all

literature bald, and all authors (if you like) but one."



"Well, well," add Mr. Thomson, "we shall see."
