Extracted from his Memoirs.



. . . Here was I, therefore, on the streets of that city, the name

of which I cannot call to mind, while even then I was so ill-

acquainted with its situation that I knew not whether to go south

or north.  The alert being sudden, I had run forth without shoes or

stockings; my hat had been struck from my head in the mellay; my

kit was in the hands of the English; I had no companion but the

cipaye, no weapon but my sword, and the devil a coin in my pocket.

In short, I was for all the world like one of those calendars with

whom Mr. Galland has made us acquainted in his elegant tales.

These gentlemen, you will remember, were for ever falling in with

extraordinary incidents; and I was myself upon the brink of one so

astonishing that I protest I cannot explain it to this day.



The cipaye was a very honest man; he had served many years with the

French colours, and would have let himself be cut to pieces for any

of the brave countrymen of Mr. Lally.  It is the same fellow (his

name has quite escaped me) of whom I have narrated already a

surprising instance of generosity of mind - when he found Mr. de

Fessac and myself upon the ramparts, entirely overcome with liquor,

and covered us with straw while the commandant was passing by.  I

consulted him, therefore, with perfect freedom.  It was a fine

question what to do; but we decided at last to escalade a garden

wall, where we could certainly sleep in the shadow of the trees,

and might perhaps find an occasion to get hold of a pair of

slippers and a turban.  In that part of the city we had only the

difficulty of the choice, for it was a quarter consisting entirely

of walled gardens, and the lanes which divided them were at that

hour of the night deserted.  I gave the cipaye a back, and we had

soon dropped into a large enclosure full of trees.  The place was

soaking with the dew, which, in that country, is exceedingly

unwholesome, above all to whites; yet my fatigue was so extreme

that I was already half asleep, when the cipaye recalled me to my

senses.  In the far end of the enclosure a bright light had

suddenly shone out, and continued to burn steadily among the

leaves.  It was a circumstance highly unusual in such a place and

hour; and, in our situation, it behoved us to proceed with some

timidity.  The cipaye was sent to reconnoitre, and pretty soon

returned with the intelligence that we had fallen extremely amiss,

for the house belonged to a white man, who was in all likelihood

English.



"Faith," says I, "if there is a white man to be seen, I will have a

look at him; for, the Lord be praised! there are more sorts than

the one!"



The cipaye led me forward accordingly to a place from which I had a

clear view upon the house.  It was surrounded with a wide verandah;

a lamp, very well trimmed, stood upon the floor of it, and on

either side of the lamp there sat a man, cross-legged, after the

Oriental manner.  Both, besides, were bundled up in muslin like two

natives; and yet one of them was not only a white man, but a man

very well known to me and the reader, being indeed that very Master

of Ballantrae of whose gallantry and genius I have had to speak so

often.  Word had reached me that he was come to the Indies, though

we had never met at least, and I heard little of his occupations.

But, sure, I had no sooner recognised him, and found myself in the

arms of so old a comrade, than I supposed my tribulations were

quite done.  I stepped plainly forth into the light of the moon,

which shone exceeding strong, and hailing Ballantrae by name, made

him in a few words master of my grievous situation.  He turned,

started the least thing in the world, looked me fair in the face

while I was speaking, and when I had done addressed himself to his

companion in the barbarous native dialect.  The second person, who

was of an extraordinary delicate appearance, with legs like walking

canes and fingers like the stalk of a tobacco pipe, (6) now rose to

his feet.



"The Sahib," says he, "understands no English language.  I

understand it myself, and I see you make some small mistake - oh!

which may happen very often.  But the Sahib would be glad to know

how you come in a garden."



"Ballantrae!" I cried, "have you the damned impudence to deny me to

my face?"



Ballantrae never moved a muscle, staring at me like an image in a

pagoda.



"The Sahib understands no English language," says the native, as

glib as before.  "He be glad to know how you come in a garden."



"Oh! the divil fetch him," says I.  "He would be glad to know how I

come in a garden, would he?  Well, now, my dear man, just have the

civility to tell the Sahib, with my kind love, that we are two

soldiers here whom he never met and never heard of, but the cipaye

is a broth of a boy, and I am a broth of a boy myself; and if we

don't get a full meal of meat, and a turban, and slippers, and the

value of a gold mohur in small change as a matter of convenience,

bedad, my friend, I could lay my finger on a garden where there is

going to be trouble."



They carried their comedy so far as to converse awhile in

Hindustanee; and then says the Hindu, with the same smile, but

sighing as if he were tired of the repetition, "The Sahib would be

glad to know how you come in a garden."



"Is that the way of it?" says I, and laying my hand on my sword-

hilt I bade the cipaye draw.



Ballantrae's Hindu, still smiling, pulled out a pistol from his

bosom, and though Ballantrae himself never moved a muscle I knew

him well enough to be sure he was prepared.



"The Sahib thinks you better go away," says the Hindu.



Well, to be plain, it was what I was thinking myself; for the

report of a pistol would have been, under Providence, the means of

hanging the pair of us.



"Tell the Sahib I consider him no gentleman," says I, and turned

away with a gesture of contempt.



I was not gone three steps when the voice of the Hindu called me

back.  "The Sahib would be glad to know if you are a dam low

Irishman," says he; and at the words Ballantrae smiled and bowed

very low.



"What is that?" says I.



"The Sahib say you ask your friend Mackellar," says the Hindu.

"The Sahib he cry quits."



"Tell the Sahib I will give him a cure for the Scots fiddle when

next we meet," cried I.



The pair were still smiling as I left.



There is little doubt some flaws may be picked in my own behaviour;

and when a man, however gallant, appeals to posterity with an

account of his exploits, he must almost certainly expect to share

the fate of Caesar and Alexander, and to meet with some detractors.

But there is one thing that can never be laid at the door of

Francis Burke:  he never turned his back on a friend. . . .



(Here follows a passage which the Chevalier Burke has been at the

pains to delete before sending me his manuscript.  Doubtless it was

some very natural complaint of what he supposed to be an

indiscretion on my part; though, indeed, I can call none to mind.

Perhaps Mr. Henry was less guarded; or it is just possible the

Master found the means to examine my correspondence, and himself

read the letter from Troyes:  in revenge for which this cruel jest

was perpetrated on Mr. Burke in his extreme necessity.  The Master,

for all his wickedness, was not without some natural affection; I

believe he was sincerely attached to Mr. Burke in the beginning;

but the thought of treachery dried up the springs of his very

shallow friendship, and his detestable nature appeared naked. - E.
