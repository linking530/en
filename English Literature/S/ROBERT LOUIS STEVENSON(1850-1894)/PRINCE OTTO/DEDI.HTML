<I>AT last, after so many years, I have the pleasure of re-introducing
you to `Prince Otto,' whom you will remember a very little fellow, no bigger
in fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by your kind hand.
The sight of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house embowered
in creepers; a house that was far gone in the respectable stages of antiquity
and seemed indissoluble from the green garden in which it stood, and that
yet was a sea-traveller in its younger days, and had come round the Horn
piecemeal in the belly of a ship, and might have heard the seamen stamping
and shouting and the note of the boatswain's whistle. It will recall to
you the nondescript inhabitants now so widely scattered:-- the two horses,
the dog, and the four cats, some of them still looking in your face as
you read these lines;-- the poor lady, so unfortunately married to an author;--
the China boy, by this time, perhaps, baiting his line by the banks of
a river in the Flowery Land;-- and in particular the Scot who was then
sick apparently unto death, and whom you did so much to cheer and keep
in good behaviour.</I>

<P><I>&nbsp;You may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs:
so soon as he had his health again completely, you may remember the fortune
he was to earn, the journeys he was to go upon, the delights he was to
enjoy and confer, and (among other matters) the masterpiece he was to make
of `Prince Otto'!</I>

<P><I>&nbsp;Well, we will not give in that we are finally beaten. We read
together in those days the story of Braddock, and how, as he was carried
dying from the scene of his defeat, he promised himself to do better another
time: a story that will always touch a brave heart, and a dying speech
worthy of a more fortunate commander. I try to be of Braddock's mind. I
still mean to get my health again; I still purpose, by hook or crook, this
book or the next, to launch a masterpiece; and I still intend -- somehow,
some time or other -- to see your face and to hold your hand.</I>

<P><I>&nbsp;Meanwhile, this little paper traveller goes forth instead,
crosses the great seas and the long plains and the dark mountains, and
comes at last to your door in Monterey, charged with tender greetings.
Pray you, take him in. He comes from a house where (even as in your own)
there are gathered together some of the waifs of our company at Oakland:
a house -- for all its outlandish Gaelic name and distant station -- where
you are well-beloved.</I>
