While my husband and Mr. Henley were engaged in writing plays in

Bournemouth they made a number of titles, hoping to use them in

the future.  Dramatic composition was not what my husband

preferred, but the torrent of Mr. Henley's enthusiasm swept him

off his feet.  However, after several plays had been finished,

and his health seriously impaired by his endeavours to keep up

with Mr. Henley, play writing was abandoned forever, and my

husband returned to his legitimate vocation.  Having added one of

the titles, The Hanging Judge, to the list of projected plays,

now thrown aside, and emboldened by my husband's offer to give me

any help needed, I concluded to try and write it myself.



As I wanted a trial scene in the Old Bailey, I chose the period

of 1700 for my purpose; but being shamefully ignorant of my

subject, and my husband confessing to little more knowledge than

I possessed, a London bookseller was commissioned to send us

everything he could procure bearing on Old Bailey trials.  A

great package came in response to our order, and very soon we

were both absorbed, not so much in the trials as in following the

brilliant career of a Mr. Garrow, who appeared as counsel in many

of the cases.  We sent for more books, and yet more, still intent

on Mr. Garrow, whose subtle cross-examination of witnesses and

masterly, if sometimes startling, methods of arriving at the

truth seemed more thrilling to us than any novel.



Occasionally other trials than those of the Old Bailey would be

included in the package of books we received from London; among

these my husband found and read with avidity:--





THE

TRIAL

OF

JAMES STEWART

in Aucharn in Duror of Appin

FOR THE

Murder of COLIN CAMPBELL of Glenure, Efq;

Factor for His Majefty on the forfeited

Estate of Ardfhiel.





My husband was always interested in this period of his country's

history, and had already the intention of writing a story that

should turn on the Appin murder.  The tale was to be of a boy,

David Balfour, supposed to belong to my husband's own family, who

should travel in Scotland as though it were a foreign country,

meeting with various adventures and misadventures by the way.

From the trial of James Stewart my husband gleaned much valuable

material for his novel, the most important being the character of

Alan Breck.  Aside from having described him as "smallish in

stature," my husband seems to have taken Alan Breck's personal

appearance, even to his clothing, from the book.



A letter from James Stewart to Mr. John Macfarlane, introduced as

evidence in the trial, says: "There is one Alan Stewart, a

distant friend of the late Ardshiel's, who is in the French

service, and came over in March last, as he said to some, in

order to settle at home; to others, that he was to go soon back;

and was, as I hear, the day that the murder was committed, seen

not far from the place where it happened, and is not now to be

seen; by which it is believed he was the actor.  He is a

desperate foolish fellow; and if he is guilty, came to the

country for that very purpose.  He is a tall, pock-pitted lad,

very black hair, and wore a blue coat and metal buttons, an old

red vest, and breeches of the same colour."  A second witness

testified to having seen him wearing "a blue coat with silver

buttons, a red waistcoat, black shag breeches, tartan hose, and a

feathered hat, with a big coat, dun coloured," a costume referred

to by one of the counsel as "French cloathes which were

remarkable."



There are many incidents given in the trial that point to Alan's

fiery spirit and Highland quickness to take offence.  One witness

"declared also That the said Alan Breck threatened that he would

challenge Ballieveolan and his sons to fight because of his

removing the declarant last year from Glenduror." On another

page: "Duncan Campbell, change-keeper at Annat, aged thirty-five

years, married, witness cited, sworn, purged and examined ut

supra, depones, That, in the month of April last, the deponent

met with Alan Breck Stewart, with whom he was not acquainted, and

John Stewart, in Auchnacoan, in the house of the walk miller of

Auchofragan, and went on with them to the house: Alan Breck

Stewart said, that he hated all the name of Campbell; and the

deponent said, he had no reason for doing so: But Alan said, he

had very good reason for it: that thereafter they left that

house; and, after drinking a dram at another house, came to the

deponent's house, where they went in, and drunk some drams, and

Alan Breck renewed the former Conversation; and the deponent,

making the same answer, Alan said, that, if the deponent had any

respect for his friends, he would tell them, that if they offered

to turn out the possessors of Ardshiel's estate, he would make

black cocks of them, before they entered into possession by which

the deponent understood shooting them, it being a common phrase

in the country."



Some time after the publication of Kidnapped we stopped for a

short while in the Appin country, where we were surprised and

interested to discover that the feeling concerning the murder of

Glenure (the "Red Fox," also called "Colin Roy") was almost as

keen as though the tragedy had taken place the day before.  For

several years my husband received letters of expostulation or

commendation from members of the Campbell and Stewart clans.  I

have in my possession a paper, yellow with age, that was sent

soon after the novel appeared, containing "The Pedigree of the

Family of Appine," wherein it is said that "Alan 3rd Baron of

Appine was not killed at Flowdoun, tho there, but lived to a

great old age.  He married Cameron Daughter to Ewen Cameron of

Lochiel."  Following this is a paragraph stating that "John

Stewart 1st of Ardsheall of his descendants Alan Breck had better

be omitted.  Duncan Baan Stewart in Achindarroch his father was a

Bastard."



One day, while my husband was busily at work, I sat beside him

reading an old cookery book called The Compleat Housewife: or

Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion.  In the midst of receipts

for "Rabbits, and Chickens mumbled, Pickled Samphire, Skirret

Pye, Baked Tansy," and other forgotten delicacies, there were

directions for the preparation of several lotions for the

preservation of beauty.  One of these was so charming that I

interrupted my husband to read it aloud.  "Just what I wanted!"

he exclaimed; and the receipt for the "Lily of the Valley Water"

was instantly incorporated into Kidnapped.
