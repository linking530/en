IN a pleasant, airy, up-hill country, it was my fortune when I was 

young to make the acquaintance of a certain beggar.  I call him 

beggar, though he usually allowed his coat and his shoes (which 

were open-mouthed, indeed) to beg for him.  He was the wreck of an 

athletic man, tall, gaunt, and bronzed; far gone in consumption, 

with that disquieting smile of the mortally stricken on his face; 

but still active afoot, still with the brisk military carriage, the 

ready military salute.  Three ways led through this piece of 

country; and as I was inconstant in my choice, I believe he must 

often have awaited me in vain.  But often enough, he caught me; 

often enough, from some place of ambush by the roadside, he would 

spring suddenly forth in the regulation attitude, and launching at 

once into his inconsequential talk, fall into step with me upon my 

farther course.  "A fine morning, sir, though perhaps a trifle 

inclining to rain.  I hope I see you well, sir.  Why, no, sir, I 

don't feel as hearty myself as I could wish, but I am keeping about 

my ordinary.  I am pleased to meet you on the road, sir.  I assure 

you I quite look forward to one of our little conversations."  He 

loved the sound of his own voice inordinately, and though (with 

something too off-hand to call servility) he would always hasten to 

agree with anything you said, yet he could never suffer you to say 

it to an end.  By what transition he slid to his favourite subject 

I have no memory; but we had never been long together on the way 

before he was dealing, in a very military manner, with the English 

poets.  "Shelley was a fine poet, sir, though a trifle atheistical 

in his opinions.  His Queen Mab, sir, is quite an atheistical work.  

Scott, sir, is not so poetical a writer.  With the works of 

Shakespeare I am not so well acquainted, but he was a fine poet.  

Keats - John Keats, sir - he was a very fine poet."  With such 

references, such trivial criticism, such loving parade of his own 

knowledge, he would beguile the road, striding forward uphill, his 

staff now clapped to the ribs of his deep, resonant chest, now 

swinging in the air with the remembered jauntiness of the private 

soldier; and all the while his toes looking out of his boots, and 

his shirt looking out of his elbows, and death looking out of his 

smile, and his big, crazy frame shaken by accesses of cough.



He would often go the whole way home with me:  often to borrow a 

book, and that book always a poet.  Off he would march, to continue 

his mendicant rounds, with the volume slipped into the pocket of 

his ragged coat; and although he would sometimes keep it quite a 

while, yet it came always back again at last, not much the worse 

for its travels into beggardom.  And in this way, doubtless, his 

knowledge grew and his glib, random criticism took a wider range.  

But my library was not the first he had drawn upon:  at our first 

encounter, he was already brimful of Shelley and the atheistical 

Queen Mab, and "Keats - John Keats, sir."  And I have often 

wondered how he came by these acquirements; just as I often 

wondered how he fell to be a beggar.  He had served through the 

Mutiny - of which (like so many people) he could tell practically 

nothing beyond the names of places, and that it was "difficult 

work, sir," and very hot, or that so-and-so was "a very fine 

commander, sir."  He was far too smart a man to have remained a 

private; in the nature of things, he must have won his stripes.  

And yet here he was without a pension.  When I touched on this 

problem, he would content himself with diffidently offering me 

advice.  "A man should be very careful when he is young, sir.  If 

you'll excuse me saying so, a spirited young gentleman like 

yourself, sir, should be very careful.  I was perhaps a trifle 

inclined to atheistical opinions myself."  For (perhaps with a 

deeper wisdom than we are inclined in these days to admit) he 

plainly bracketed agnosticism with beer and skittles.



Keats - John Keats, sir - and Shelley were his favourite bards.  I 

cannot remember if I tried him with Rossetti; but I know his taste 

to a hair, and if ever I did, he must have doted on that author.  

What took him was a richness in the speech; he loved the exotic, 

the unexpected word; the moving cadence of a phrase; a vague sense 

of emotion (about nothing) in the very letters of the alphabet:  

the romance of language.  His honest head was very nearly empty, 

his intellect like a child's; and when he read his favourite 

authors, he can almost never have understood what he was reading.  

Yet the taste was not only genuine, it was exclusive; I tried in 

vain to offer him novels; he would none of them, he cared for 

nothing but romantic language that he could not understand.  The 

case may be commoner than we suppose.  I am reminded of a lad who 

was laid in the next cot to a friend of mine in a public hospital 

and who was no sooner installed than he sent out (perhaps with his 

last pence) for a cheap Shakespeare.  My friend pricked up his 

ears; fell at once in talk with his new neighbour, and was ready, 

when the book arrived, to make a singular discovery.  For this 

lover of great literature understood not one sentence out of 

twelve, and his favourite part was that of which he understood the 

least - the inimitable, mouth-filling rodomontade of the ghost in 

HAMLET.  It was a bright day in hospital when my friend expounded 

the sense of this beloved jargon:  a task for which I am willing to 

believe my friend was very fit, though I can never regard it as an 

easy one.  I know indeed a point or two, on which I would gladly 

question Mr. Shakespeare, that lover of big words, could he revisit 

the glimpses of the moon, or could I myself climb backward to the 

spacious days of Elizabeth.  But in the second case, I should most 

likely pretermit these questionings, and take my place instead in 

the pit at the Blackfriars, to hear the actor in his favourite 

part, playing up to Mr. Burbage, and rolling out - as I seem to 

hear him - with a ponderous gusto-



"Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd."



What a pleasant chance, if we could go there in a party I and what 

a surprise for Mr. Burbage, when the ghost received the honours of 

the evening!



As for my old soldier, like Mr. Burbage and Mr. Shakespeare, he is 

long since dead; and now lies buried, I suppose, and nameless and 

quite forgotten, in some poor city graveyard. - But not for me, you 

brave heart, have you been buried!  For me, you are still afoot, 

tasting the sun and air, and striding southward.  By the groves of 

Comiston and beside the Hermitage of Braid, by the Hunters' Tryst, 

and where the curlews and plovers cry around Fairmilehead, I see 

and hear you, stalwartly carrying your deadly sickness, cheerfully 

discoursing of uncomprehended poets.





II





The thought of the old soldier recalls that of another tramp, his 

counterpart.  This was a little, lean, and fiery man, with the eyes 

of a dog and the face of a gipsy; whom I found one morning encamped 

with his wife and children and his grinder's wheel, beside the burn 

of Kinnaird.  To this beloved dell I went, at that time, daily; and 

daily the knife-grinder and I (for as long as his tent continued 

pleasantly to interrupt my little wilderness) sat on two stones, 

and smoked, and plucked grass, and talked to the tune of the brown 

water.  His children were mere whelps, they fought and bit among 

the fern like vermin.  His wife was a mere squaw; I saw her gather 

brush and tend the kettle, but she never ventured to address her 

lord while I was present.  The tent was a mere gipsy hovel, like a 

sty for pigs.  But the grinder himself had the fine self-

sufficiency and grave politeness of the hunter and the savage; he 

did me the honours of this dell, which had been mine but the day 

before, took me far into the secrets of his life, and used me (I am 

proud to remember) as a friend.



Like my old soldier, he was far gone in the national complaint.  

Unlike him, he had a vulgar taste in letters; scarce flying higher 

than the story papers; probably finding no difference, certainly 

seeking none, between Tannahill and Burns; his noblest thoughts, 

whether of poetry or music, adequately embodied in that somewhat 

obvious ditty,



"Will ye gang, lassie, gang

To the braes o' Balquidder."



- which is indeed apt to echo in the ears of Scottish children, and 

to him, in view of his experience, must have found a special 

directness of address.  But if he had no fine sense of poetry in 

letters, he felt with a deep joy the poetry of life.  You should 

have heard him speak of what he loved; of the tent pitched beside 

the talking water; of the stars overhead at night; of the blest 

return of morning, the peep of day over the moors, the awaking 

birds among the birches; how he abhorred the long winter shut in 

cities; and with what delight, at the return of the spring, he once 

more pitched his camp in the living out-of-doors.  But we were a 

pair of tramps; and to you, who are doubtless sedentary and a 

consistent first-class passenger in life, he would scarce have laid 

himself so open; - to you, he might have been content to tell his 

story of a ghost - that of a buccaneer with his pistols as he lived 

- whom he had once encountered in a seaside cave near Buckie; and 

that would have been enough, for that would have shown you the 

mettle of the man.  Here was a piece of experience solidly and 

livingly built up in words, here was a story created, TERES ATQUE 

ROTUNDUS.



And to think of the old soldier, that lover of the literary bards!  

He had visited stranger spots than any seaside cave; encountered 

men more terrible than any spirit; done and dared and suffered in 

that incredible, unsung epic of the Mutiny War; played his part 

with the field force of Delhi, beleaguering and beleaguered; shared 

in that enduring, savage anger and contempt of death and decency 

that, for long months together, bedevil'd and inspired the army; 

was hurled to and fro in the battle-smoke of the assault; was 

there, perhaps, where Nicholson fell; was there when the attacking 

column, with hell upon every side, found the soldier's enemy - 

strong drink, and the lives of tens of thousands trembled in the 

scale, and the fate of the flag of England staggered.  And of all 

this he had no more to say than "hot work, sir," or "the army 

suffered a great deal, sir," or "I believe General Wilson, sir, was 

not very highly thought of in the papers."  His life was naught to 

him, the vivid pages of experience quite blank:  in words his 

pleasure lay - melodious, agitated words - printed words, about 

that which he had never seen and was connatally incapable of 

comprehending.  We have here two temperaments face to face; both 

untrained, unsophisticated, surprised (we may say) in the egg; both 

boldly charactered:  - that of the artist, the lover and artificer 

of words; that of the maker, the seeer, the lover and forger of 

experience.  If the one had a daughter and the other had a son, and 

these married, might not some illustrious writer count descent from 

the beggar-soldier and the needy knife-grinder?





III





Every one lives by selling something, whatever be his right to it.  

The burglar sells at the same time his own skill and courage and my 

silver plate (the whole at the most moderate figure) to a Jew 

receiver.  The bandit sells the traveller an article of prime 

necessity:  that traveller's life.  And as for the old soldier, who 

stands for central mark to my capricious figures of eight, he dealt 

in a specially; for he was the only beggar in the world who ever 

gave me pleasure for my money.  He had learned a school of manners 

in the barracks and had the sense to cling to it, accosting 

strangers with a regimental freedom, thanking patrons with a merely 

regimental difference, sparing you at once the tragedy of his 

position and the embarrassment of yours.  There was not one hint 

about him of the beggar's emphasis, the outburst of revolting 

gratitude, the rant and cant, the "God bless you, Kind, Kind 

gentleman," which insults the smallness of your alms by 

disproportionate vehemence, which is so notably false, which would 

be so unbearable if it were true.  I am sometimes tempted to 

suppose this reading of the beggar's part, a survival of the old 

days when Shakespeare was intoned upon the stage and mourners 

keened beside the death-bed; to think that we cannot now accept 

these strong emotions unless they be uttered in the just note of 

life; nor (save in the pulpit) endure these gross conventions.  

They wound us, I am tempted to say, like mockery; the high voice of 

keening (as it yet lingers on) strikes in the face of sorrow like a 

buffet; and the rant and cant of the staled beggar stirs in us a 

shudder of disgust.  But the fact disproves these amateur opinions.  

The beggar lives by his knowledge of the average man.  He knows 

what he is about when he bandages his head, and hires and drugs a 

babe, and poisons life with POOR MARY ANN or LONG, LONG AGO; he 

knows what he is about when he loads the critical ear and sickens 

the nice conscience with intolerable thanks; they know what they 

are about, he and his crew, when they pervade the slums of cities, 

ghastly parodies of suffering, hateful parodies of gratitude.  This 

trade can scarce be called an imposition; it has been so blown upon 

with exposures; it flaunts its fraudulence so nakedly.  We pay them 

as we pay those who show us, in huge exaggeration, the monsters of 

our drinking-water; or those who daily predict the fall of Britain.  

We pay them for the pain they inflict, pay them, and wince, and 

hurry on.  And truly there is nothing that can shake the conscience 

like a beggar's thanks; and that polity in which such protestations 

can be purchased for a shilling, seems no scene for an honest man.



Are there, then, we may be asked, no genuine beggars?  And the 

answer is, Not one.  My old soldier was a humbug like the rest; his 

ragged boots were, in the stage phrase, properties; whole boots 

were given him again and again, and always gladly accepted; and the 

next day, there he was on the road as usual, with toes exposed.  

His boots were his method; they were the man's trade; without his 

boots he would have starved; he did not live by charity, but by 

appealing to a gross taste in the public, which loves the limelight 

on the actor's face, and the toes out of the beggar's boots.  There 

is a true poverty, which no one sees:  a false and merely mimetic 

poverty, which usurps its place and dress, and lives and above all 

drinks, on the fruits of the usurpation.  The true poverty does not 

go into the streets; the banker may rest assured, he has never put 

a penny in its hand.  The self-respecting poor beg from each other; 

never from the rich.  To live in the frock-coated ranks of life, to 

hear canting scenes of gratitude rehearsed for twopence, a man 

might suppose that giving was a thing gone out of fashion; yet it 

goes forward on a scale so great as to fill me with surprise.  In 

the houses of the working class, all day long there will be a foot 

upon the stair; all day long there will be a knocking at the doors; 

beggars come, beggars go, without stint, hardly with intermission, 

from morning till night; and meanwhile, in the same city and but a 

few streets off, the castles of the rich stand unsummoned.  Get the 

tale of any honest tramp, you will find it was always the poor who 

helped him; get the truth from any workman who has met misfortunes, 

it was always next door that he would go for help, or only with 

such exceptions as are said to prove a rule; look at the course of 

the mimetic beggar, it is through the poor quarters that he trails 

his passage, showing his bandages to every window, piercing even to 

the attics with his nasal song.  Here is a remarkable state of 

things in our Christian commonwealths, that the poor only should be 

asked to give.





IV





There is a pleasant tale of some worthless, phrasing Frenchman, who 

was taxed with ingratitude:  "IL FAUT SAVOIR GARDER L'INDEPENDANCE 

DU COEUR," cried he.  I own I feel with him.  Gratitude without 

familarity, gratitude otherwise than as a nameless element in a 

friendship, is a thing so near to hatred that I do not care to 

split the difference.  Until I find a man who is pleased to receive 

obligations, I shall continue to question the tact of those who are 

eager to confer them.  What an art it is, to give, even to our 

nearest friends! and what a test of manners, to receive!  How, upon 

either side, we smuggle away the obligation, blushing for each 

other; how bluff and dull we make the giver; how hasty, how falsely 

cheerful, the receiver!  And yet an act of such difficulty and 

distress between near friends, it is supposed we can perform to a 

total stranger and leave the man transfixed with grateful emotions.  

The last thing you can do to a man is to burthen him with an 

obligation, and it is what we propose to begin with!  But let us 

not be deceived:  unless he is totally degraded to his trade, anger 

jars in his inside, and he grates his teeth at our gratuity.



We should wipe two words from our vocabulary:  gratitude and 

charity.  In real life, help is given out of friendship, or it is 

not valued; it is received from the hand of friendship, or it is 

resented.  We are all too proud to take a naked gift:  we must seem 

to pay it, if in nothing else, then with the delights of our 

society.  Here, then, is the pitiful fix of the rich man; here is 

that needle's eye in which he stuck already in the days of Christ, 

and still sticks to-day, firmer, if possible, than ever:  that he 

has the money and lacks the love which should make his money 

acceptable.  Here and now, just as of old in Palestine, he has the 

rich to dinner, it is with the rich that he takes his pleasure:  

and when his turn comes to be charitable, he looks in vain for a 

recipient.  His friends are not poor, they do not want; the poor 

are not his friends, they will not take.  To whom is he to give?  

Where to find - note this phase - the Deserving Poor?  Charity is 

(what they call) centralised; offices are hired; societies founded, 

with secretaries paid or unpaid:  the hunt of the Deserving Poor 

goes merrily forward.  I think it will take more than a merely 

human secretary to disinter that character.  What! a class that is 

to be in want from no fault of its own, and yet greedily eager to 

receive from strangers; and to be quite respectable, and at the 

same time quite devoid of self-respect; and play the most delicate 

part of friendship, and yet never be seen; and wear the form of 

man, and yet fly in the face of all the laws of human nature:  - 

and all this, in the hope of getting a belly-god Burgess through a 

needle's eye!  O, let him stick, by all means:  and let his polity 

tumble in the dust; and let his epitaph and all his literature (of 

which my own works begin to form no inconsiderable part) be 

abolished even from the history of man!  For a fool of this 

monstrosity of dulness, there can be no salvation:  and the fool 

who looked for the elixir of life was an angel of reason to the 

fool who looks for the Deserving Poor!





V





And yet there is one course which the unfortunate gentleman may 

take.  He may subscribe to pay the taxes.  There were the true 

charity, impartial and impersonal, cumbering none with obligation, 

helping all.  There were a destination for loveless gifts; there 

were the way to reach the pocket of the deserving poor, and yet 

save the time of secretaries!  But, alas! there is no colour of 

romance in such a course; and people nowhere demand the picturesque 

so much as in their virtues.
