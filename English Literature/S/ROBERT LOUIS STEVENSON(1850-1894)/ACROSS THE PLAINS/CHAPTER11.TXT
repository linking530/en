We look for some reward of our endeavours and are disappointed; not 

success, not happiness, not even peace of conscience, crowns our 

ineffectual efforts to do well.  Our frailties are invincible, our 

virtues barren; the battle goes sore against us to the going down 

of the sun.  The canting moralist tells us of right and wrong; and 

we look abroad, even on the face of our small earth, and find them 

change with every climate, and no country where some action is not 

honoured for a virtue and none where it is not branded for a vice; 

and we look in our experience, and find no vital congruity in the 

wisest rules, but at the best a municipal fitness.  It is not 

strange if we are tempted to despair of good.  We ask too much.  

Our religions and moralities have been trimmed to flatter us, till 

they are all emasculate and sentimentalised, and only please and 

weaken.  Truth is of a rougher strain.  In the harsh face of life, 

faith can read a bracing gospel.  The human race is a thing more 

ancient than the ten commandments; and the bones and revolutions of 

the Kosmos, in whose joints we are but moss and fungus, more 

ancient still.





I





Of the Kosmos in the last resort, science reports many doubtful 

things and all of them appalling.  There seems no substance to this 

solid globe on which we stamp:  nothing but symbols and ratios.  

Symbols and ratios carry us and bring us forth and beat us down; 

gravity that swings the incommensurable suns and worlds through 

space, is but a figment varying inversely as the squares of 

distances; and the suns and worlds themselves, imponderable figures 

of abstraction, NH3, and H2O.  Consideration dares not dwell upon 

this view; that way madness lies; science carries us into zones of 

speculation, where there is no habitable city for the mind of man.



But take the Kosmos with a grosser faith, as our senses give it us.  

We behold space sown with rotatory islands, suns and worlds and the 

shards and wrecks of systems:  some, like the sun, still blazing; 

some rotting, like the earth; others, like the moon, stable in 

desolation.  All of these we take to be made of something we call 

matter:  a thing which no analysis can help us to conceive; to 

whose incredible properties no familiarity can reconcile our minds.  

This stuff, when not purified by the lustration of fire, rots 

uncleanly into something we call life; seized through all its atoms 

with a pediculous malady; swelling in tumours that become 

independent, sometimes even (by an abhorrent prodigy) locomotory; 

one splitting into millions, millions cohering into one, as the 

malady proceeds through varying stages.  This vital putrescence of 

the dust, used as we are to it, yet strikes us with occasional 

disgust, and the profusion of worms in a piece of ancient turf, or 

the air of a marsh darkened with insects, will sometimes check our 

breathing so that we aspire for cleaner places.  But none is clean:  

the moving sand is infected with lice; the pure spring, where it 

bursts out of the mountain, is a mere issue of worms; even in the 

hard rock the crystal is forming.



In two main shapes this eruption covers the countenance of the 

earth:  the animal and the vegetable:  one in some degree the 

inversion of the other:  the second rooted to the spot; the first 

coming detached out of its natal mud, and scurrying abroad with the 

myriad feet of insects or towering into the heavens on the wings of 

birds:  a thing so inconceivable that, if it be well considered, 

the heart stops.  To what passes with the anchored vermin, we have 

little clue, doubtless they have their joys and sorrows, their 

delights and killing agonies:  it appears not how.  But of the 

locomotory, to which we ourselves belong, we can tell more.  These 

share with us a thousand miracles:  the miracles of sight, of 

hearing, of the projection of sound, things that bridge space; the 

miracles of memory and reason, by which the present is conceived, 

and when it is gone, its image kept living in the brains of man and 

brute; the miracle of reproduction, with its imperious desires and 

staggering consequences.  And to put the last touch upon this 

mountain mass of the revolting and the inconceivable, all these 

prey upon each other, lives tearing other lives in pieces, cramming 

them inside themselves, and by that summary process, growing fat:  

the vegetarian, the whale, perhaps the tree, not less than the lion 

of the desert; for the vegetarian is only the eater of the dumb.



Meanwhile our rotatory island loaded with predatory life, and more 

drenched with blood, both animal and vegetable, than ever mutinied 

ship, scuds through space with unimaginable speed, and turns 

alternate cheeks to the reverberation of a blazing world, ninety 

million miles away.





II





What a monstrous spectre is this man, the disease of the 

agglutinated dust, lifting alternate feet or lying drugged with 

slumber; killing, feeding, growing, bringing forth small copies of 

himself; grown upon with hair like grass, fitted with eyes that 

move and glitter in his face; a thing to set children screaming; - 

and yet looked at nearlier, known as his fellows know him, how 

surprising are his attributes!  Poor soul, here for so little, cast 

among so many hardships, filled with desires so incommensurate and 

so inconsistent, savagely surrounded, savagely descended, 

irremediably condemned to prey upon his fellow lives:  who should 

have blamed him had he been of a piece with his destiny and a being 

merely barbarous?  And we look and behold him instead filled with 

imperfect virtues:  infinitely childish, often admirably valiant, 

often touchingly kind; sitting down, amidst his momentary life, to 

debate of right and wrong and the attributes of the deity; rising 

up to do battle for an egg or die for an idea; singling out his 

friends and his mate with cordial affection; bringing forth in 

pain, rearing with long-suffering solicitude, his young.  To touch 

the heart of his mystery, we find, in him one thought, strange to 

the point of lunacy:  the thought of duty; the thought of something 

owing to himself, to his neighbour, to his God:  an ideal of 

decency, to which he would rise if it were possible; a limit of 

shame, below which, if it be possible, he will not stoop.  The 

design in most men is one of conformity; here and there, in picked 

natures, it transcends itself and soars on the other side, arming 

martyrs with independence; but in all, in their degrees, it is a 

bosom thought:  - Not in man alone, for we trace it in dogs and 

cats whom we know fairly well, and doubtless some similar point of 

honour sways the elephant, the oyster, and the louse, of whom we 

know so little:  - But in man, at least, it sways with so complete 

an empire that merely selfish things come second, even with the 

selfish:  that appetites are starved, fears are conquered, pains 

supported; that almost the dullest shrinks from the reproof of a 

glance, although it were a child's; and all but the most cowardly 

stand amid the risks of war; and the more noble, having strongly 

conceived an act as due to their ideal, affront and embrace death.  

Strange enough if, with their singular origin and perverted 

practice, they think they are to be rewarded in some future life:  

stranger still, if they are persuaded of the contrary, and think 

this blow, which they solicit, will strike them senseless for 

eternity.  I shall be reminded what a tragedy of misconception and 

misconduct man at large presents:  of organised injustice, cowardly 

violence and treacherous crime; and of the damning imperfections of 

the best.  They cannot be too darkly drawn.  Man is indeed marked 

for failure in his efforts to do right.  But where the best 

consistently miscarry, how tenfold more remarkable that all should 

continue to strive; and surely we should find it both touching and 

inspiriting, that in a field from which success is banished, our 

race should not cease to labour.



If the first view of this creature, stalking in his rotatory isle, 

be a thing to shake the courage of the stoutest, on this nearer 

sight, he startles us with an admiring wonder.  It matters not 

where we look, under what climate we observe him, in what stage of 

society, in what depth of ignorance, burthened with what erroneous 

morality; by camp-fires in Assiniboia, the snow powdering his 

shoulders, the wind plucking his blanket, as he sits, passing the 

ceremonial calumet and uttering his grave opinions like a Roman 

senator; in ships at sea, a man inured to hardship and vile 

pleasures, his brightest hope a fiddle in a tavern and a bedizened 

trull who sells herself to rob him, and he for all that simple, 

innocent, cheerful, kindly like a child, constant to toil, brave to 

drown, for others; in the slums of cities, moving among indifferent 

millions to mechanical employments, without hope of change in the 

future, with scarce a pleasure in the present, and yet true to his 

virtues, honest up to his lights, kind to his neighbours, tempted 

perhaps in vain by the bright gin-palace, perhaps long-suffering 

with the drunken wife that ruins him; in India (a woman this time) 

kneeling with broken cries and streaming tears, as she drowns her 

child in the sacred river; in the brothel, the discard of society, 

living mainly on strong drink, fed with affronts, a fool, a thief, 

the comrade of thieves, and even here keeping the point of honour 

and the touch of pity, often repaying the world's scorn with 

service, often standing firm upon a scruple, and at a certain cost, 

rejecting riches:  - everywhere some virtue cherished or affected, 

everywhere some decency of thought and carriage, everywhere the 

ensign of man's ineffectual goodness:  - ah! if I could show you 

this! if I could show you these men and women, all the world over, 

in every stage of history, under every abuse of error, under every 

circumstance of failure, without hope, without help, without 

thanks, still obscurely fighting the lost fight of virtue, still 

clinging, in the brothel or on the scaffold, to some rag of honour, 

the poor jewel of their souls!  They may seek to escape, and yet 

they cannot; it is not alone their privilege and glory, but their 

doom; they are condemned to some nobility; all their lives long, 

the desire of good is at their heels, the implacable hunter.



Of all earth's meteors, here at least is the most strange and 

consoling:  that this ennobled lemur, this hair-crowned bubble of 

the dust, this inheritor of a few years and sorrows, should yet 

deny himself his rare delights, and add to his frequent pains, and 

live for an ideal, however misconceived.  Nor can we stop with man.  

A new doctrine, received with screams a little while ago by canting 

moralists, and still not properly worked into the body of our 

thoughts, lights us a step farther into the heart of this rough but 

noble universe.  For nowadays the pride of man denies in vain his 

kinship with the original dust.  He stands no longer like a thing 

apart.  Close at his heels we see the dog, prince of another genus:  

and in him too, we see dumbly testified the same cultus of an 

unattainable ideal, the same constancy in failure.  Does it stop 

with the dog?  We look at our feet where the ground is blackened 

with the swarming ant:  a creature so small, so far from us in the 

hierarchy of brutes, that we can scarce trace and scarce comprehend 

his doings; and here also, in his ordered politics and rigorous 

justice, we see confessed the law of duty and the fact of 

individual sin.  Does it stop, then, with the ant?  Rather this 

desire of well-doing and this doom of frailty run through all the 

grades of life:  rather is this earth, from the frosty top of 

Everest to the next margin of the internal fire, one stage of 

ineffectual virtues and one temple of pious tears and perseverance.  

The whole creation groaneth and travaileth together.  It is the 

common and the god-like law of life.  The browsers, the biters, the 

barkers, the hairy coats of field and forest, the squirrel in the 

oak, the thousand-footed creeper in the dust, as they share with us 

the gift of life, share with us the love of an ideal:  strive like 

us - like us are tempted to grow weary of the struggle - to do 

well; like us receive at times unmerited refreshment, visitings of 

support, returns of courage; and are condemned like us to be 

crucified between that double law of the members and the will.  Are 

they like us, I wonder, in the timid hope of some reward, some 

sugar with the drug? do they, too, stand aghast at unrewarded 

virtues, at the sufferings of those whom, in our partiality, we 

take to be just, and the prosperity of such as, in our blindness, 

we call wicked?  It may be, and yet God knows what they should look 

for.  Even while they look, even while they repent, the foot of man 

treads them by thousands in the dust, the yelping hounds burst upon 

their trail, the bullet speeds, the knives are heating in the den 

of the vivisectionist; or the dew falls, and the generation of a 

day is blotted out.  For these are creatures, compared with whom 

our weakness is strength, our ignorance wisdom, our brief span 

eternity.



And as we dwell, we living things, in our isle of terror and under 

the imminent hand of death, God forbid it should be man the 

erected, the reasoner, the wise in his own eyes - God forbid it 

should be man that wearies in well-doing, that despairs of 

unrewarded effort, or utters the language of complaint.  Let it be 

enough for faith, that the whole creation groans in mortal frailty, 

strives with unconquerable constancy:  Surely not all in vain.
