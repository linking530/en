I. - THE COAST OF FIFE





MANY writers have vigorously described the pains of the first day 

or the first night at school; to a boy of any enterprise, I 

believe, they are more often agreeably exciting.  Misery - or at 

least misery unrelieved - is confined to another period, to the 

days of suspense and the "dreadful looking-for" of departure; when 

the old life is running to an end, and the new life, with its new 

interests, not yet begun:  and to the pain of an imminent parting, 

there is added the unrest of a state of conscious pre-existence.  

The area railings, the beloved shop-window, the smell of semi-

suburban tanpits, the song of the church bells upon a Sunday, the 

thin, high voices of compatriot children in a playing-field - what 

a sudden, what an overpowering pathos breathes to him from each 

familiar circumstance!  The assaults of sorrow come not from 

within, as it seems to him, but from without.  I was proud and glad 

to go to school; had I been let alone, I could have borne up like 

any hero; but there was around me, in all my native town, a 

conspiracy of lamentation:  "Poor little boy, he is going away - 

unkind little boy, he is going to leave us"; so the unspoken 

burthen followed me as I went, with yearning and reproach.  And at 

length, one melancholy afternoon in the early autumn, and at a 

place where it seems to me, looking back, it must be always autumn 

and generally Sunday, there came suddenly upon the face of all I 

saw - the long empty road, the lines of the tall houses, the church 

upon the hill, the woody hillside garden - a look of such a 

piercing sadness that my heart died; and seating myself on a door-

step, I shed tears of miserable sympathy.  A benevolent cat 

cumbered me the while with consolations - we two were alone in all 

that was visible of the London Road:  two poor waifs who had each 

tasted sorrow - and she fawned upon the weeper, and gambolled for 

his entertainment, watching the effect it seemed, with motherly 

eyes.



For the sake of the cat, God bless her!  I confessed at home the 

story of my weakness; and so it comes about that I owed a certain 

journey, and the reader owes the present paper, to a cat in the 

London Road.  It was judged, if I had thus brimmed over on the 

public highway, some change of scene was (in the medical sense) 

indicated; my father at the time was visiting the harbour lights of 

Scotland; and it was decided he should take me along with him 

around a portion of the shores of Fife; my first professional tour, 

my first journey in the complete character of man, without the help 

of petticoats.



The Kingdom of Fife (that royal province) may be observed by the 

curious on the map, occupying a tongue of land between the firths 

of Forth and Tay.  It may be continually seen from many parts of 

Edinburgh (among the rest, from the windows of my father's house) 

dying away into the distance and the easterly HAAR with one smoky 

seaside town beyond another, or in winter printing on the gray 

heaven some glittering hill-tops.  It has no beauty to recommend 

it, being a low, sea-salted, wind-vexed promontory; trees very 

rare, except (as common on the east coast) along the dens of 

rivers; the fields well cultivated, I understand, but not lovely to 

the eye.  It is of the coast I speak:  the interior may be the 

garden of Eden.  History broods over that part of the world like 

the easterly HAAR.  Even on the map, its long row of Gaelic place-

names bear testimony to an old and settled race.  Of these little 

towns, posted along the shore as close as sedges, each with its bit 

of harbour, its old weather-beaten church or public building, its 

flavour of decayed prosperity and decaying fish, not one but has 

its legend, quaint or tragic:  Dunfermline, in whose royal towers 

the king may be still observed (in the ballad) drinking the blood-

red wine; somnolent Inverkeithing, once the quarantine of Leith; 

Aberdour, hard by the monastic islet of Inchcolm, hard by 

Donibristle where the "bonny face was spoiled"; Burntisland where, 

when Paul Jones was off the coast, the Reverend Mr. Shirra had a 

table carried between tidemarks, and publicly prayed against the 

rover at the pitch of his voice and his broad lowland dialect; 

Kinghorn, where Alexander "brak's neckbane" and left Scotland to 

the English wars; Kirkcaldy, where the witches once prevailed 

extremely and sank tall ships and honest mariners in the North Sea; 

Dysart, famous - well famous at least to me for the Dutch ships 

that lay in its harbour, painted like toys and with pots of flowers 

and cages of song-birds in the cabin windows, and for one 

particular Dutch skipper who would sit all day in slippers on the 

break of the poop, smoking a long German pipe; Wemyss (pronounce 

Weems) with its bat-haunted caves, where the Chevalier Johnstone, 

on his flight from Culloden, passed a night of superstitious 

terrors; Leven, a bald, quite modern place, sacred to summer 

visitors, whence there has gone but yesterday the tall figure and 

the white locks of the last Englishman in Delhi, my uncle Dr. 

Balfour, who was still walking his hospital rounds, while the 

troopers from Meerut clattered and cried "Deen Deen" along the 

streets of the imperial city, and Willoughby mustered his handful 

of heroes at the magazine, and the nameless brave one in the 

telegraph office was perhaps already fingering his last despatch; 

and just a little beyond Leven, Largo Law and the smoke of Largo 

town mounting about its feet, the town of Alexander Selkirk, better 

known under the name of Robinson Crusoe.  So on, the list might be 

pursued (only for private reasons, which the reader will shortly 

have an opportunity to guess) by St. Monance, and Pittenweem, and 

the two Anstruthers, and Cellardyke, and Crail, where Primate 

Sharpe was once a humble and innocent country minister:  on to the 

heel of the land, to Fife Ness, overlooked by a sea-wood of matted 

elders and the quaint old mansion of Balcomie, itself overlooking 

but the breach or the quiescence of the deep - the Carr Rock beacon 

rising close in front, and as night draws in, the star of the 

Inchcape reef springing up on the one hand, and the star of the May 

Island on the other, and farther off yet a third and a greater on 

the craggy foreland of St. Abb's.  And but a little way round the 

corner of the land, imminent itself above the sea, stands the gem 

of the province and the light of mediaeval Scotland, St. Andrews, 

where the great Cardinal Beaton held garrison against the world, 

and the second of the name and title perished (as you may read in 

Knox's jeering narrative) under the knives of true-blue 

Protestants, and to this day (after so many centuries) the current 

voice of the professor is not hushed.



Here it was that my first tour of inspection began, early on a 

bleak easterly morning.  There was a crashing run of sea upon the 

shore, I recollect, and my father and the man of the harbour light 

must sometimes raise their voices to be audible.  Perhaps it is 

from this circumstance, that I always imagine St. Andrews to be an 

ineffectual seat of learning, and the sound of the east wind and 

the bursting surf to linger in its drowsy classrooms and confound 

the utterance of the professor, until teacher and taught are alike 

drowned in oblivion, and only the sea-gull beats on the windows and 

the draught of the sea-air rustles in the pages of the open 

lecture.  But upon all this, and the romance of St. Andrews in 

general, the reader must consult the works of Mr. Andrew Lang; who 

has written of it but the other day in his dainty prose and with 

his incommunicable humour, and long ago in one of his best poems, 

with grace, and local truth, and a note of unaffected pathos.  Mr. 

Lang knows all about the romance, I say, and the educational 

advantages, but I doubt if he had turned his attention to the 

harbour lights; and it may be news even to him, that in the year 

1863 their case was pitiable.  Hanging about with the east wind 

humming in my teeth, and my hands (I make no doubt) in my pockets, 

I looked for the first time upon that tragi-comedy of the visiting 

engineer which I have seen so often re-enacted on a more important 

stage.  Eighty years ago, I find my grandfather writing:  "It is 

the most painful thing that can occur to me to have a 

correspondence of this kind with any of the keepers, and when I 

come to the Light House, instead of having the satisfaction to meet 

them with approbation and welcome their Family, it is distressing 

when one-is obliged to put on a most angry countenance and 

demeanour."  This painful obligation has been hereditary in my 

race.  I have myself, on a perfectly amateur and unauthorised 

inspection of Turnberry Point, bent my brows upon the keeper on the 

question of storm-panes; and felt a keen pang of self-reproach, 

when we went down stairs again and I found he was making a coffin 

for his infant child; and then regained my equanimity with the 

thought that I had done the man a service, and when the proper 

inspector came, he would be readier with his panes.  The human race 

is perhaps credited with more duplicity than it deserves.  The 

visitation of a lighthouse at least is a business of the most 

transparent nature.  As soon as the boat grates on the shore, and 

the keepers step forward in their uniformed coats, the very slouch 

of the fellows' shoulders tells their story, and the engineer may 

begin at once to assume his "angry countenance."  Certainly the 

brass of the handrail will be clouded; and if the brass be not 

immaculate, certainly all will be to match - the reflectors 

scratched, the spare lamp unready, the storm-panes in the 

storehouse.  If a light is not rather more than middling good, it 

will be radically bad.  Mediocrity (except in literature) appears 

to be unattainable by man.  But of course the unfortunate of St. 

Andrews was only an amateur, he was not in the Service, he had no 

uniform coat, he was (I believe) a plumber by his trade and stood 

(in the mediaeval phrase) quite out of the danger of my father; but 

he had a painful interview for all that, and perspired extremely.



From St. Andrews, we drove over Magus Muir.  My father had 

announced we were "to post," and the phrase called up in my hopeful 

mind visions of top-boots and the pictures in Rowlandson's DANCE OF 

DEATH; but it was only a jingling cab that came to the inn door, 

such as I had driven in a thousand times at the low price of one 

shilling on the streets of Edinburgh.  Beyond this disappointment, 

I remember nothing of that drive.  It is a road I have often 

travelled, and of not one of these journeys do I remember any 

single trait.  The fact has not been suffered to encroach on the 

truth of the imagination.  I still see Magus Muir two hundred years 

ago; a desert place, quite uninclosed; in the midst, the primate's 

carriage fleeing at the gallop; the assassins loose-reined in 

pursuit, Burley Balfour, pistol in hand, among the first.  No scene 

of history has ever written itself so deeply on my mind; not 

because Balfour, that questionable zealot, was an ancestral cousin 

of my own; not because of the pleadings of the victim and his 

daughter; not even because of the live bum-bee that flew out of 

Sharpe's 'bacco-box, thus clearly indicating his complicity with 

Satan; nor merely because, as it was after all a crime of a fine 

religious flavour, it figured in Sunday books and afforded a 

grateful relief from MINISTERING CHILDREN or the MEMOIRS OF MRS. 

KATHATINE WINSLOWE.  The figure that always fixed my attention is 

that of Hackston of Rathillet, sitting in the saddle with his cloak 

about his mouth, and through all that long, bungling, vociferous 

hurly-burly, revolving privately a case of conscience.  He would 

take no hand in the deed, because he had a private spite against 

the victim, and "that action" must be sullied with no suggestion of 

a worldly motive; on the other hand, "that action," in itself, was 

highly justified, he had cast in his lot with "the actors," and he 

must stay there, inactive but publicly sharing the responsibility.  

"You are a gentleman - you will protect me!" cried the wounded old 

man, crawling towards him.  "I will never lay a hand on you," said 

Hackston, and put his cloak about his mouth.  It is an old 

temptation with me, to pluck away that cloak and see the face - to 

open that bosom and to read the heart.  With incomplete romances 

about Hackston, the drawers of my youth were lumbered.  I read him 

up in every printed book that I could lay my hands on.  I even dug 

among the Wodrow manuscripts, sitting shame-faced in the very room 

where my hero had been tortured two centuries before, and keenly 

conscious of my youth in the midst of other and (as I fondly 

thought) more gifted students.  All was vain:  that he had passed a 

riotous nonage, that he was a zealot, that he twice displayed 

(compared with his grotesque companions) some tincture of soldierly 

resolution and even of military common sense, and that he figured 

memorably in the scene on Magus Muir, so much and no more could I 

make out.  But whenever I cast my eyes backward, it is to see him 

like a landmark on the plains of history, sitting with his cloak 

about his mouth, inscrutable.  How small a thing creates an 

immortality!  I do not think he can have been a man entirely 

commonplace; but had he not thrown his cloak about his mouth, or 

had the witnesses forgot to chronicle the action, he would not thus 

have haunted the imagination of my boyhood, and to-day he would 

scarce delay me for a paragraph.  An incident, at once romantic and 

dramatic, which at once awakes the judgment and makes a picture for 

the eye, how little do we realise its perdurable power!  Perhaps no 

one does so but the author, just as none but he appreciates the 

influence of jingling words; so that he looks on upon life, with 

something of a covert smile, seeing people led by what they fancy 

to be thoughts and what are really the accustomed artifices of his 

own trade, or roused by what they take to be principles and are 

really picturesque effects.  In a pleasant book about a school-

class club, Colonel Fergusson has recently told a little anecdote.  

A "Philosophical Society" was formed by some Academy boys - among 

them, Colonel Fergusson himself, Fleeming Jenkin, and Andrew 

Wilson, the Christian Buddhist and author of THE ABODE OF SNOW.  

Before these learned pundits, one member laid the following 

ingenious problem:  "What would be the result of putting a pound of 

potassium in a pot of porter?"  "I should think there would be a 

number of interesting bi-products," said a smatterer at my elbow; 

but for me the tale itself has a bi-product, and stands as a type 

of much that is most human.  For this inquirer who conceived 

himself to burn with a zeal entirely chemical, was really immersed 

in a design of a quite different nature; unconsciously to his own 

recently breeched intelligence, he was engaged in literature.  

Putting, pound, potassium, pot, porter; initial p, mediant t - that 

was his idea, poor little boy!  So with politics and that which 

excites men in the present, so with history and that which rouses 

them in the past:  there lie at the root of what appears, most 

serious unsuspected elements.



The triple town of Anstruther Wester, Anstruther Easter, and 

Cellardyke, all three Royal Burghs - or two Royal Burghs and a less 

distinguished suburb, I forget which - lies continuously along the 

seaside, and boasts of either two or three separate parish 

churches, and either two or three separate harbours.  These 

ambiguities are painful; but the fact is (although it argue me 

uncultured), I am but poorly posted upon Cellardyke.  My business 

lay in the two Anstruthers.  A tricklet of a stream divides them, 

spanned by a bridge; and over the bridge at the time of my 

knowledge, the celebrated Shell House stood outpost on the west.  

This had been the residence of an agreeable eccentric; during his 

fond tenancy, he had illustrated the outer walls, as high (if I 

remember rightly) as the roof, with elaborate patterns and 

pictures, and snatches of verse in the vein of EXEGI MONUMENTUM; 

shells and pebbles, artfully contrasted and conjoined, had been his 

medium; and I like to think of him standing back upon the bridge, 

when all was finished, drinking in the general effect and (like 

Gibbon) already lamenting his employment.



The same bridge saw another sight in the seventeenth century.  Mr. 

Thomson, the "curat" of Anstruther Easter, was a man highly 

obnoxious to the devout:  in the first place, because he was a 

"curat"; in the second place, because he was a person of irregular 

and scandalous life; and in the third place, because he was 

generally suspected of dealings with the Enemy of Man.  These three 

disqualifications, in the popular literature of the time, go hand 

in hand; but the end of Mr. Thomson was a thing quite by itself, 

and in the proper phrase, a manifest judgment.  He had been at a 

friend's house in Anstruther Wester, where (and elsewhere, I 

suspect) he had partaken of the bottle; indeed, to put the thing in 

our cold modern way, the reverend gentleman was on the brink of 

DELIRIUM TREMENS.  It was a dark night, it seems; a little lassie 

came carrying a lantern to fetch the curate home; and away they 

went down the street of Anstruther Wester, the lantern swinging a 

bit in the child's hand, the barred lustre tossing up and down 

along the front of slumbering houses, and Mr. Thomson not 

altogether steady on his legs nor (to all appearance) easy in his 

mind.  The pair had reached the middle of the bridge when (as I 

conceive the scene) the poor tippler started in some baseless fear 

and looked behind him; the child, already shaken by the minister's 

strange behaviour, started also; in so doing, she would jerk the 

lantern; and for the space of a moment the lights and the shadows 

would be all confounded.  Then it was that to the unhinged toper 

and the twittering child, a huge bulk of blackness seemed to sweep 

down, to pass them close by as they stood upon the bridge, and to 

vanish on the farther side in the general darkness of the night.  

"Plainly the devil come for Mr. Thomson!" thought the child.  What 

Mr. Thomson thought himself, we have no ground of knowledge; but he 

fell upon his knees in the midst of the bridge like a man praying.  

On the rest of the journey to the manse, history is silent; but 

when they came to the door, the poor caitiff, taking the lantern 

from the child, looked upon her with so lost a countenance that her 

little courage died within her, and she fled home screaming to her 

parents.  Not a soul would venture out; all that night, the 

minister dwelt alone with his terrors in the manse; and when the 

day dawned, and men made bold to go about the streets, they found 

the devil had come indeed for Mr. Thomson.



This manse of Anstruther Easter has another and a more cheerful 

association.  It was early in the morning, about a century before 

the days of Mr. Thomson, that his predecessor was called out of bed 

to welcome a Grandee of Spain, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, just 

landed in the harbour underneath.  But sure there was never seen a 

more decayed grandee; sure there was never a duke welcomed from a 

stranger place of exile.  Half-way between Orkney and Shetland, 

there lies a certain isle; on the one hand the Atlantic, on the 

other the North Sea, bombard its pillared cliffs; sore-eyed, short-

living, inbred fishers and their families herd in its few huts; in 

the graveyard pieces of wreck-wood stand for monuments; there is 

nowhere a more inhospitable spot.  BELLE-ISLE-EN-MER - Fair-Isle-

at-Sea - that is a name that has always rung in my mind's ear like 

music; but the only "Fair Isle" on which I ever set my foot, was 

this unhomely, rugged turret-top of submarine sierras.  Here, when 

his ship was broken, my lord Duke joyfully got ashore; here for 

long months he and certain of his men were harboured; and it was 

from this durance that he landed at last to be welcomed (as well as 

such a papist deserved, no doubt) by the godly incumbent of 

Anstruther Easter; and after the Fair Isle, what a fine city must 

that have appeared! and after the island diet, what a hospitable 

spot the minister's table!  And yet he must have lived on friendly 

terms with his outlandish hosts.  For to this day there still 

survives a relic of the long winter evenings when the sailors of 

the great Armada crouched about the hearths of the Fair-Islanders, 

the planks of their own lost galleon perhaps lighting up the scene, 

and the gale and the surf that beat about the coast contributing 

their melancholy voices.  All the folk of the north isles are great 

artificers of knitting:  the Fair-Islanders alone dye their fabrics 

in the Spanish manner.  To this day, gloves and nightcaps, 

innocently decorated, may be seen for sale in the Shetland 

warehouse at Edinburgh, or on the Fair Isle itself in the 

catechist's house; and to this day, they tell the story of the Duke 

of Medina Sidonia's adventure.



It would seem as if the Fair Isle had some attraction for "persons 

of quality."  When I landed there myself, an elderly gentleman, 

unshaved, poorly attired, his shoulders wrapped in a plaid, was 

seen walking to and fro, with a book in his hand, upon the beach.  

He paid no heed to our arrival, which we thought a strange thing in 

itself; but when one of the officers of the PHAROS, passing 

narrowly by him, observed his book to be a Greek Testament, our 

wonder and interest took a higher flight.  The catechist was cross-

examined; he said the gentleman had been put across some time 

before in Mr. Bruce of Sumburgh's schooner, the only link between 

the Fair Isle and the rest of the world; and that he held services 

and was doing "good."  So much came glibly enough; but when pressed 

a little farther, the catechist displayed embarrassment.  A 

singular diffidence appeared upon his face:  "They tell me," said 

he, in low tones, "that he's a lord."  And a lord he was; a peer of 

the realm pacing that inhospitable beach with his Greek Testament, 

and his plaid about his shoulders, set upon doing good, as he 

understood it, worthy man!  And his grandson, a good-looking little 

boy, much better dressed than the lordly evangelist, and speaking 

with a silken English accent very foreign to the scene, accompanied 

me for a while in my exploration of the island.  I suppose this 

little fellow is now my lord, and wonder how much he remembers of 

the Fair Isle.  Perhaps not much; for he seemed to accept very 

quietly his savage situation; and under such guidance, it is like 

that this was not his first nor yet his last adventure.
