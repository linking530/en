II. - THE EDUCATION OF AN ENGINEER





ANSTRUTHER is a place sacred to the Muse; she inspired (really to a 

considerable extent) Tennant's vernacular poem ANST'ER FAIR; and I 

have there waited upon her myself with much devotion.  This was 

when I came as a young man to glean engineering experience from the 

building of the breakwater.  What I gleaned, I am sure I do not 

know; but indeed I had already my own private determination to be 

an author; I loved the art of words and the appearances of life; 

and TRAVELLERS, and HEADERS, and RUBBLE, and POLISHED ASHLAR, and 

PIERRES PERDUES, and even the thrilling question of the STRING-

COURSE, interested me only (if they interested me at all) as 

properties for some possible romance or as words to add to my 

vocabulary.  To grow a little catholic is the compensation of 

years; youth is one-eyed; and in those days, though I haunted the 

breakwater by day, and even loved the place for the sake of the 

sunshine, the thrilling seaside air, the wash of waves on the sea-

face, the green glimmer of the divers' helmets far below, and the 

musical chinking of the masons, my one genuine preoccupation lay 

elsewhere, and my only industry was in the hours when I was not on 

duty.  I lodged with a certain Bailie Brown, a carpenter by trade; 

and there, as soon as dinner was despatched, in a chamber scented 

with dry rose-leaves, drew in my chair to the table and proceeded 

to pour forth literature, at such a speed, and with such 

intimations of early death and immortality, as I now look back upon 

with wonder.  Then it was that I wrote VOCES FIDELIUM, a series of 

dramatic monologues in verse; then that I indited the bulk of a 

covenanting novel - like so many others, never finished.  Late I 

sat into the night, toiling (as I thought) under the very dart of 

death, toiling to leave a memory behind me.  I feel moved to thrust 

aside the curtain of the years, to hail that poor feverish idiot, 

to bid him go to bed and clap VOCES FIDELIUM on the fire before he 

goes; so clear does he appear before me, sitting there between his 

candles in the rose-scented room and the late night; so ridiculous 

a picture (to my elderly wisdom) does the fool present!  But he was 

driven to his bed at last without miraculous intervention; and the 

manner of his driving sets the last touch upon this eminently 

youthful business.  The weather was then so warm that I must keep 

the windows open; the night without was populous with moths.  As 

the late darkness deepened, my literary tapers beaconed forth more 

brightly; thicker and thicker came the dusty night-fliers, to 

gyrate for one brilliant instant round the flame and fall in 

agonies upon my paper.  Flesh and blood could not endure the 

spectacle; to capture immortality was doubtless a noble enterprise, 

but not to capture it at such a cost of suffering; and out would go 

the candles, and off would I go to bed in the darkness raging to 

think that the blow might fall on the morrow, and there was VOCES 

FIDELIUM still incomplete.  Well, the moths are - all gone, and 

VOCES FIDELIUM along with them; only the fool is still on hand and 

practises new follies.



Only one thing in connection with the harbour tempted me, and that 

was the diving, an experience I burned to taste of.  But this was 

not to be, at least in Anstruther; and the subject involves a 

change of scene to the sub-arctic town of Wick.  You can never have 

dwelt in a country more unsightly than that part of Caithness, the 

land faintly swelling, faintly falling, not a tree, not a hedgerow, 

the fields divided by single slate stones set upon their edge, the 

wind always singing in your ears and (down the long road that led 

nowhere) thrumming in the telegraph wires.  Only as you approached 

the coast was there anything to stir the heart.  The plateau broke 

down to the North Sea in formidable cliffs, the tall out-stacks 

rose like pillars ringed about with surf, the coves were over-

brimmed with clamorous froth, the sea-birds screamed, the wind sang 

in the thyme on the cliff's edge; here and there, small ancient 

castles toppled on the brim; here and there, it was possible to dip 

into a dell of shelter, where you might lie and tell yourself you 

were a little warm, and hear (near at hand) the whin-pods bursting 

in the afternoon sun, and (farther off) the rumour of the turbulent 

sea.  As for Wick itself, it is one of the meanest of man's towns, 

and situate certainly on the baldest of God's bays.  It lives for 

herring, and a strange sight it is to see (of an afternoon) the 

heights of Pulteney blackened by seaward-looking fishers, as when a 

city crowds to a review - or, as when bees have swarmed, the ground 

is horrible with lumps and clusters; and a strange sight, and a 

beautiful, to see the fleet put silently out against a rising moon, 

the sea-line rough as a wood with sails, and ever and again and one 

after another, a boat flitting swiftly by the silver disk.  This 

mass of fishers, this great fleet of boats, is out of all 

proportion to the town itself; and the oars are manned and the nets 

hauled by immigrants from the Long Island (as we call the outer 

Hebrides), who come for that season only, and depart again, if "the 

take" be poor, leaving debts behind them.  In a bad year, the end 

of the herring fishery is therefore an exciting time; fights are 

common, riots often possible; an apple knocked from a child's hand 

was once the signal for something like a war; and even when I was 

there, a gunboat lay in the bay to assist the authorities.  To 

contrary interests, it should be observed, the curse of Babel is 

here added; the Lews men are Gaelic speakers.  Caithness has 

adopted English; an odd circumstance, if you reflect that both must 

be largely Norsemen by descent.  I remember seeing one of the 

strongest instances of this division:  a thing like a Punch-and-

Judy box erected on the flat grave-stones of the churchyard; from 

the hutch or proscenium - I know not what to call it - an eldritch-

looking preacher laying down the law in Gaelic about some one of 

the name of POWL, whom I at last divined to be the apostle to the 

Gentiles; a large congregation of the Lews men very devoutly 

listening; and on the outskirts of the crowd, some of the town's 

children (to whom the whole affair was Greek and Hebrew) profanely 

playing tigg.  The same descent, the same country, the same narrow 

sect of the same religion, and all these bonds made very largely 

nugatory by an accidental difference of dialect!



Into the bay of Wick stretched the dark length of the unfinished 

breakwater, in its cage of open staging; the travellers (like 

frames of churches) over-plumbing all; and away at the extreme end, 

the divers toiling unseen on the foundation.  On a platform of 

loose planks, the assistants turned their air-mills; a stone might 

be swinging between wind and water; underneath the swell ran gaily; 

and from time to time, a mailed dragon with a window-glass snout 

came dripping up the ladder.  Youth is a blessed season after all; 

my stay at Wick was in the year of VOCES FIDELIUM and the rose-leaf 

room at Bailie Brown's; and already I did not care two straws for 

literary glory.  Posthumous ambition perhaps requires an atmosphere 

of roses; and the more rugged excitant of Wick east winds had made 

another boy of me.  To go down in the diving-dress, that was my 

absorbing fancy; and with the countenance of a certain handsome 

scamp of a diver, Bob Bain by name, I gratified the whim.



It was gray, harsh, easterly weather, the swell ran pretty high, 

and out in the open there were "skipper's daughters," when I found 

myself at last on the diver's platform, twenty pounds of lead upon 

each foot and my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen 

underclothing.  One moment, the salt wind was whistling round my 

night-capped head; the next, I was crushed almost double under the 

weight of the helmet.  As that intolerable burthern was laid upon 

me, I could have found it in my heart (only for shame's sake) to 

cry off from the whole enterprise.  But it was too late.  The 

attendants began to turn the hurdy-gurdy, and the air to whistle 

through the tube; some one screwed in the barred window of the 

vizor; and I was cut off in a moment from my fellow-men; standing 

there in their midst, but quite divorced from intercourse:  a 

creature deaf and dumb, pathetically looking forth upon them from a 

climate of his own.  Except that I could move and feel, I was like 

a man fallen in a catalepsy.  But time was scarce given me to 

realise my isolation; the weights were hung upon my back and 

breast, the signal rope was thrust into my unresisting hand; and 

setting a twenty-pound foot upon the ladder, I began ponderously to 

descend.



Some twenty rounds below the platform, twilight fell.  Looking up, 

I saw a low green heaven mottled with vanishing bells of white; 

looking around, except for the weedy spokes and shafts of the 

ladder, nothing but a green gloaming, somewhat opaque but very 

restful and delicious.  Thirty rounds lower, I stepped off on the 

PIERRES PERDUES of the foundation; a dumb helmeted figure took me 

by the hand, and made a gesture (as I read it) of encouragement; 

and looking in at the creature's window, I beheld the face of Bain.  

There we were, hand to hand and (when it pleased us) eye to eye; 

and either might have burst himself with shouting, and not a 

whisper come to his companion's hearing.  Each, in his own little 

world of air, stood incommunicably separate.



Bob had told me ere this a little tale, a five minutes' drama at 

the bottom of the sea, which at that moment possibly shot across my 

mind.  He was down with another, settling a stone of the sea-wall.  

They had it well adjusted, Bob gave the signal, the scissors were 

slipped, the stone set home; and it was time to turn to something 

else.  But still his companion remained bowed over the block like a 

mourner on a tomb, or only raised himself to make absurd 

contortions and mysterious signs unknown to the vocabulary of the 

diver.  There, then, these two stood for awhile, like the dead and 

the living; till there flashed a fortunate thought into Bob's mind, 

and he stooped, peered through the window of that other world, and 

beheld the face of its inhabitant wet with streaming tears.  Ah! 

the man was in pain!  And Bob, glancing downward, saw what was the 

trouble:  the block had been lowered on the foot of that 

unfortunate - he was caught alive at the bottom of the sea under 

fifteen tons of rock.



That two men should handle a stone so heavy, even swinging in the 

scissors, may appear strange to the inexpert.  These must bear in 

mind the great density of the water of the sea, and the surprising 

results of transplantation to that medium.  To understand a little 

what these are, and how a man's weight, so far from being an 

encumbrance, is the very ground of his agility, was the chief 

lesson of my submarine experience.  The knowledge came upon me by 

degrees.  As I began to go forward with the hand of my estranged 

companion, a world of tumbled stones was visible, pillared with the 

weedy uprights of the staging:  overhead, a flat roof of green:  a 

little in front, the sea-wall, like an unfinished rampart.  And 

presently in our upward progress, Bob motioned me to leap upon a 

stone; I looked to see if he were possibly in earnest, and he only 

signed to me the more imperiously.  Now the block stood six feet 

high; it would have been quite a leap to me unencumbered; with the 

breast and back weights, and the twenty pounds upon each foot, and 

the staggering load of the helmet, the thing was out of reason.  I 

laughed aloud in my tomb; and to prove to Bob how far he was 

astray, I gave a little impulse from my toes.  Up I soared like a 

bird, my companion soaring at my side.  As high as to the stone, 

and then higher, I pursued my impotent and empty flight.  Even when 

the strong arm of Bob had checked my shoulders, my heels continued 

their ascent; so that I blew out sideways like an autumn leaf, and 

must be hauled in, hand over hand, as sailors haul in the slack of 

a sail, and propped upon my feet again like an intoxicated sparrow.  

Yet a little higher on the foundation, and we began to be affected 

by the bottom of the swell, running there like a strong breeze of 

wind.  Or so I must suppose; for, safe in my cushion of air, I was 

conscious of no impact; only swayed idly like a weed, and was now 

borne helplessly abroad, and now swiftly - and yet with dream-like 

gentleness - impelled against my guide.  So does a child's balloon 

divagate upon the currents of the air, and touch, and slide off 

again from every obstacle.  So must have ineffectually swung, so 

resented their inefficiency, those light crowds that followed the 

Star of Hades, and uttered exiguous voices in the land beyond 

Cocytus.



There was something strangely exasperating, as well as strangely 

wearying, in these uncommanded evolutions.  It is bitter to return 

to infancy, to be supported, and directed, and perpetually set upon 

your feet, by the hand of some one else.  The air besides, as it is 

supplied to you by the busy millers on the platform, closes the 

eustachian tubes and keeps the neophyte perpetually swallowing, 

till his throat is grown so dry that he can swallow no longer.  And 

for all these reasons-although I had a fine, dizzy, muddle-headed 

joy in my surroundings, and longed, and tried, and always failed, 

to lay hands on the fish that darted here and there about me, swift 

as humming-birds - yet I fancy I was rather relieved than otherwise 

when Bain brought me back to the ladder and signed to me to mount.  

And there was one more experience before me even then.  Of a 

sudden, my ascending head passed into the trough of a swell.  Out 

of the green, I shot at once into a glory of rosy, almost of 

sanguine light - the multitudinous seas incarnadined, the heaven 

above a vault of crimson.  And then the glory faded into the hard, 

ugly daylight of a Caithness autumn, with a low sky, a gray sea, 

and a whistling wind.



Bob Bain had five shillings for his trouble, and I had done what I 

desired.  It was one of the best things I got from my education as 

an engineer:  of which, however, as a way of life, I wish to speak 

with sympathy.  It takes a man into the open air; it keeps him 

hanging about harbour-sides, which is the richest form of idling; 

it carries him to wild islands; it gives him a taste of the genial 

dangers of the sea; it supplies him with dexterities to exercise; 

it makes demands upon his ingenuity; it will go far to cure him of 

any taste (if ever he had one) for the miserable life of cities.  

And when it has done so, it carries him back and shuts him in an 

office!  From the roaring skerry and the wet thwart of the tossing 

boat, he passes to the stool and desk; and with a memory full of 

ships, and seas, and perilous headlands, and the shining pharos, he 

must apply his long-sighted eyes to the petty niceties of drawing, 

or measure his inaccurate mind with several pages of consecutive 

figures.  He is a wise youth, to be sure, who can balance one part 

of genuine life against two parts of drudgery between four walls, 

and for the sake of the one, manfully accept the other.



Wick was scarce an eligible place of stay.  But how much better it 

was to hang in the cold wind upon the pier, to go down with Bob 

Bain among the roots of the staging, to be all day in a boat 

coiling a wet rope and shouting orders - not always very wise - 

than to be warm and dry, and dull, and dead-alive, in the most 

comfortable office.  And Wick itself had in those days a note of 

originality.  It may have still, but I misdoubt it much.  The old 

minister of Keiss would not preach, in these degenerate times, for 

an hour and a half upon the clock.  The gipsies must be gone from 

their cavern; where you might see, from the mouth, the women 

tending their fire, like Meg Merrilies, and the men sleeping off 

their coarse potations; and where, in winter gales, the surf would 

beleaguer them closely, bursting in their very door.  A traveller 

to-day upon the Thurso coach would scarce observe a little cloud of 

smoke among the moorlands, and be told, quite openly, it marked a 

private still.  He would not indeed make that journey, for there is 

now no Thurso coach.  And even if he could, one little thing that 

happened to me could never happen to him, or not with the same 

trenchancy of contrast.



We had been upon the road all evening; the coach-top was crowded 

with Lews fishers going home, scarce anything but Gaelic had 

sounded in my ears; and our way had lain throughout over a moorish 

country very northern to behold.  Latish at night, though it was 

still broad day in our subarctic latitude, we came down upon the 

shores of the roaring Pentland Firth, that grave of mariners; on 

one hand, the cliffs of Dunnet Head ran seaward; in front was the 

little bare, white town of Castleton, its streets full of blowing 

sand; nothing beyond, but the North Islands, the great deep, and 

the perennial ice-fields of the Pole.  And here, in the last 

imaginable place, there sprang up young outlandish voices and a 

chatter of some foreign speech; and I saw, pursuing the coach with 

its load of Hebridean fishers - as they had pursued VETTURINI up 

the passes of the Apennines or perhaps along the grotto under 

Virgil's tomb - two little dark-eyed, white-toothed Italian 

vagabonds, of twelve to fourteen years of age, one with a hurdy-

gurdy, the other with a cage of white mice.  The coach passed on, 

and their small Italian chatter died in the distance; and I was 

left to marvel how they had wandered into that country, and how 

they fared in it, and what they thought of it, and when (if ever) 

they should see again the silver wind-breaks run among the olives, 

and the stone-pine stand guard upon Etruscan sepulchres.



Upon any American, the strangeness of this incident is somewhat 

lost.  For as far back as he goes in his own land, he will find 

some alien camping there; the Cornish miner, the French or Mexican 

half-blood, the negro in the South, these are deep in the woods and 

far among the mountains.  But in an old, cold, and rugged country 

such as mine, the days of immigration are long at an end; and away 

up there, which was at that time far beyond the northernmost 

extreme of railways, hard upon the shore of that ill-omened strait 

of whirlpools, in a land of moors where no stranger came, unless it 

should be a sportsman to shoot grouse or an antiquary to decipher 

runes, the presence of these small pedestrians struck the mind as 

though a bird-of-paradise had risen from the heather or an 

albatross come fishing in the bay of Wick.  They were as strange to 

their surroundings as my lordly evangelist or the old Spanish 

grandee on the Fair Isle.
