THE past is all of one texture - whether feigned or suffered - 

whether acted out in three dimensions, or only witnessed in that 

small theatre of the brain which we keep brightly lighted all night 

long, after the jets are down, and darkness and sleep reign 

undisturbed in the remainder of the body.  There is no distinction 

on the face of our experiences; one is vivid indeed, and one dull, 

and one pleasant, and another agonising to remember; but which of 

them is what we call true, and which a dream, there is not one hair 

to prove.  The past stands on a precarious footing; another straw 

split in the field of metaphysic, and behold us robbed of it.  

There is scarce a family that can count four generations but lays a 

claim to some dormant title or some castle and estate:  a claim not 

prosecutable in any court of law, but flattering to the fancy and a 

great alleviation of idle hours.  A man's claim to his own past is 

yet less valid.  A paper might turn up (in proper story-book 

fashion) in the secret drawer of an old ebony secretary, and 

restore your family to its ancient honours, and reinstate mine in a 

certain West Indian islet (not far from St. Kitt's, as beloved 

tradition hummed in my young ears) which was once ours, and is now 

unjustly some one else's, and for that matter (in the state of the 

sugar trade) is not worth anything to anybody.  I do not say that 

these revolutions are likely; only no man can deny that they are 

possible; and the past, on the other baud, is, lost for ever:  our 

old days and deeds, our old selves, too, and the very world in 

which these scenes were acted, all brought down to the same faint 

residuum as a last night's dream, to some incontinuous images, and 

an echo in the chambers of the brain.  Not an hour, not a mood, not 

a glance of the eye, can we revoke; it is all gone, past conjuring.  

And yet conceive us robbed of it, conceive that little thread of 

memory that we trail behind us broken at the pocket's edge; and in 

what naked nullity should we be left! for we only guide ourselves, 

and only know ourselves, by these air-painted pictures of the past.



Upon these grounds, there are some among us who claim to have lived 

longer and more richly than their neighbours; when they lay asleep 

they claim they were still active; and among the treasures of 

memory that all men review for their amusement, these count in no 

second place the harvests of their dreams.  There is one of this 

kind whom I have in my eye, and whose case is perhaps unusual 

enough to be described.  He was from a child an ardent and 

uncomfortable dreamer.  When he had a touch of fever at night, and 

the room swelled and shrank, and his clothes, hanging on a nail, 

now loomed up instant to the bigness of a church, and now drew away 

into a horror of infinite distance and infinite littleness, the 

poor soul was very well aware of what must follow, and struggled 

hard against the approaches of that slumber which was the beginning 

of sorrows.



But his struggles were in vain; sooner or later the night-hag would 

have him by the throat, and pluck him strangling and screaming, 

from his sleep.  His dreams were at times commonplace enough, at 

times very strange, at times they were almost formless:  he would 

be haunted, for instance, by nothing more definite than a certain 

hue of brown, which he did not mind in the least while he was 

awake, but feared and loathed while he was dreaming; at times, 

again, they took on every detail of circumstance, as when once he 

supposed he must swallow the populous world, and awoke screaming 

with the horror of the thought.  The two chief troubles of his very 

narrow existence - the practical and everyday trouble of school 

tasks and the ultimate and airy one of hell and judgment - were 

often confounded together into one appalling nightmare.  He seemed 

to himself to stand before the Great White Throne; he was called 

on, poor little devil, to recite some form of words, on which his 

destiny depended; his tongue stuck, his memory was blank, hell 

gaped for him; and he would awake, clinging to the curtain-rod with 

his knees to his chin.



These were extremely poor experiences, on the whole; and at that 

time of life my dreamer would have very willingly parted with his 

power of dreams.  But presently, in the course of his growth, the 

cries and physical contortions passed away, seemingly for ever; his 

visions were still for the most part miserable, but they were more 

constantly supported; and he would awake with no more extreme 

symptom than a flying heart, a freezing scalp, cold sweats, and the 

speechless midnight fear.  His dreams, too, as befitted a mind 

better stocked with particulars, became more circumstantial, and 

had more the air and continuity of life.  The look of the world 

beginning to take hold on his attention, scenery came to play a 

part in his sleeping as well as in his waking thoughts, so that he 

would take long, uneventful journeys and see strange towns and 

beautiful places as he lay in bed.  And, what is more significant, 

an odd taste that he had for the Georgian costume and for stories 

laid in that period of English history, began to rule the features 

of his dreams; so that he masqueraded there in a three-cornered hat 

and was much engaged with Jacobite conspiracy between the hour for 

bed and that for breakfast.  About the same time, he began to read 

in his dreams - tales, for the most part, and for the most part 

after the manner of G. P. R. James, but so incredibly more vivid 

and moving than any printed book, that he has ever since been 

malcontent with literature.



And then, while he was yet a student, there came to him a dream-

adventure which he has no anxiety to repeat; he began, that is to 

say, to dream in sequence and thus to lead a double life - one of 

the day, one of the night - one that he had every reason to believe 

was the true one, another that he had no means of proving to be 

false.  I should have said he studied, or was by way of studying, 

at Edinburgh College, which (it may be supposed) was how I came to 

know him.  Well, in his dream-life, he passed a long day in the 

surgical theatre, his heart in his mouth, his teeth on edge, seeing 

monstrous malformations and the abhorred dexterity of surgeons.  In 

a heavy, rainy, foggy evening he came forth into the South Bridge, 

turned up the High Street, and entered the door of a tall LAND, at 

the top of which he supposed himself to lodge.  All night long, in 

his wet clothes, he climbed the stairs, stair after stair in 

endless series, and at every second flight a flaring lamp with a 

reflector.  All night long, he brushed by single persons passing 

downward - beggarly women of the street, great, weary, muddy 

labourers, poor scarecrows of men, pale parodies of women - but all 

drowsy and weary like himself, and all single, and all brushing 

against him as they passed.  In the end, out of a northern window, 

he would see day beginning to whiten over the Firth, give up the 

ascent, turn to descend, and in a breath be back again upon the 

streets, in his wet clothes, in the wet, haggard dawn, trudging to 

another day of monstrosities and operations.  Time went quicker in 

the life of dreams, some seven hours (as near as he can guess) to 

one; and it went, besides, more intensely, so that the gloom of 

these fancied experiences clouded the day, and he had not shaken 

off their shadow ere it was time to lie down and to renew them.  I 

cannot tell how long it was that he endured this discipline; but it 

was long enough to leave a great black blot upon his memory, long 

enough to send him, trembling for his reason, to the doors of a 

certain doctor; whereupon with a simple draught he was restored to 

the common lot of man.



The poor gentleman has since been troubled by nothing of the sort; 

indeed, his nights were for some while like other men's, now blank, 

now chequered with dreams, and these sometimes charming, sometimes 

appalling, but except for an occasional vividness, of no 

extraordinary kind.  I will just note one of these occasions, ere I 

pass on to what makes my dreamer truly interesting.  It seemed to 

him that he was in the first floor of a rough hill-farm.  The room 

showed some poor efforts at gentility, a carpet on the floor, a 

piano, I think, against the wall; but, for all these refinements, 

there was no mistaking he was in a moorland place, among hillside 

people, and set in miles of heather.  He looked down from the 

window upon a bare farmyard, that seemed to have been long disused.  

A great, uneasy stillness lay upon the world.  There was no sign of 

the farm-folk or of any live stock, save for an old, brown, curly 

dog of the retriever breed, who sat close in against the wall of 

the house and seemed to be dozing.  Something about this dog 

disquieted the dreamer; it was quite a nameless feeling, for the 

beast looked right enough - indeed, he was so old and dull and 

dusty and broken-down, that he should rather have awakened pity; 

and yet the conviction came and grew upon the dreamer that this was 

no proper dog at all, but something hellish.  A great many dozing 

summer flies hummed about the yard; and presently the dog thrust 

forth his paw, caught a fly in his open palm, carried it to his 

mouth like an ape, and looking suddenly up at the dreamer in the 

window, winked to him with one eye.  The dream went on, it matters 

not how it went; it was a good dream as dreams go; but there was 

nothing in the sequel worthy of that devilish brown dog.  And the 

point of interest for me lies partly in that very fact:  that 

having found so singular an incident, my imperfect dreamer should 

prove unable to carry the tale to a fit end and fall back on 

indescribable noises and indiscriminate horrors.  It would be 

different now; he knows his business better!



For, to approach at last the point:  This honest fellow had long 

been in the custom of setting himself to sleep with tales, and so 

had his father before him; but these were irresponsible inventions, 

told for the teller's pleasure, with no eye to the crass public or 

the thwart reviewer:  tales where a thread might be dropped, or one 

adventure quitted for another, on fancy's least suggestion.  So 

that the little people who manage man's internal theatre had not as 

yet received a very rigorous training; and played upon their stage 

like children who should have slipped into the house and found it 

empty, rather than like drilled actors performing a set piece to a 

huge hall of faces.  But presently my dreamer began to turn his 

former amusement of story-telling to (what is called) account; by 

which I mean that he began to write and sell his tales.  Here was 

he, and here were the little people who did that part of his 

business, in quite new conditions.  The stories must now be trimmed 

and pared and set upon all fours, they must run from a beginning to 

an end and fit (after a manner) with the laws of life; the 

pleasure, in one word, had become a business; and that not only for 

the dreamer, but for the little people of his theatre.  These 

understood the change as well as he.  When he lay down to prepare 

himself for sleep, he no longer sought amusement, but printable and 

profitable tales; and after he had dozed off in his box-seat, his 

little people continued their evolutions with the same mercantile 

designs.  All other forms of dream deserted him but two:  he still 

occasionally reads the most delightful books, he still visits at 

times the most delightful places; and it is perhaps worthy of note 

that to these same places, and to one in particular, he returns at 

intervals of months and years, finding new field-paths, visiting 

new neighbours, beholding that happy valley under new effects of 

noon and dawn and sunset.  But all the rest of the family of 

visions is quite lost to him:  the common, mangled version of 

yesterday's affairs, the raw-head-and-bloody-bones nightmare, 

rumoured to be the child of toasted cheese - these and their like 

are gone; and, for the most part, whether awake or asleep, he is 

simply occupied - he or his little people - in consciously making 

stories for the market.  This dreamer (like many other persons) has 

encountered some trifling vicissitudes of fortune.  When the bank 

begins to send letters and the butcher to linger at the back gate, 

he sets to belabouring his brains after a story, for that is his 

readiest money-winner; and, behold! at once the little people begin 

to bestir themselves in the same quest, and labour all night long, 

and all night long set before him truncheons of tales upon their 

lighted theatre.  No fear of his being frightened now; the flying 

heart and the frozen scalp are things by-gone; applause, growing 

applause, growing interest, growing exultation in his own 

cleverness (for he takes all the credit), and at last a jubilant 

leap to wakefulness, with the cry, "I have it, that'll do!" upon 

his lips:  with such and similar emotions he sits at these 

nocturnal dramas, with such outbreaks, like Claudius in the play, 

he scatters the performance in the midst.  Often enough the waking 

is a disappointment:  he has been too deep asleep, as I explain the 

thing; drowsiness has gained his little people, they have gone 

stumbling and maundering through their parts; and the play, to the 

awakened mind, is seen to be a tissue of absurdities.  And yet how 

often have these sleepless Brownies done him honest service, and 

given him, as he sat idly taking his pleasure in the boxes, better 

tales than he could fashion for himself.



Here is one, exactly as it came to him.  It seemed he was the son 

of a very rich and wicked man, the owner of broad acres and a most 

damnable temper.  The dreamer (and that was the son) had lived much 

abroad, on purpose to avoid his parent; and when at length he 

returned to England, it was to find him married again to a young 

wife, who was supposed to suffer cruelly and to loathe her yoke.  

Because of this marriage (as the dreamer indistinctly understood) 

it was desirable for father and son to have a meeting; and yet both 

being proud and both angry, neither would condescend upon a visit.  

Meet they did accordingly, in a desolate, sandy country by the sea; 

and there they quarrelled, and the son, stung by some intolerable 

insult, struck down the father dead.  No suspicion was aroused; the 

dead man was found and buried, and the dreamer succeeded to the 

broad estates, and found himself installed under the same roof with 

his father's widow, for whom no provision had been made.  These two 

lived very much alone, as people may after a bereavement, sat down 

to table together, shared the long evenings, and grew daily better 

friends; until it seemed to him of a sudden that she was prying 

about dangerous matters, that she had conceived a notion of his 

guilt, that she watched him and tried him with questions.  He drew 

back from her company as men draw back from a precipice suddenly 

discovered; and yet so strong was the attraction that he would 

drift again and again into the old intimacy, and again and again be 

startled back by some suggestive question or some inexplicable 

meaning in her eye.  So they lived at cross purposes, a life full 

of broken dialogue, challenging glances, and suppressed passion; 

until, one day, he saw the woman slipping from the house in a veil, 

followed her to the station, followed her in the train to the 

seaside country, and out over the sandhills to the very place where 

the murder was done.  There she began to grope among the bents, he 

watching her, flat upon his face; and presently she had something 

in her hand - I cannot remember what it was, but it was deadly 

evidence against the dreamer - and as she held it up to look at it, 

perhaps from the shock of the discovery, her foot slipped, and she 

hung at some peril on the brink of the tall sand-wreaths.  He had 

no thought but to spring up and rescue her; and there they stood 

face to face, she with that deadly matter openly in her hand - his 

very presence on the spot another link of proof.  It was plain she 

was about to speak, but this was more than he could bear - he could 

bear to be lost, but not to talk of it with his destroyer; and he 

cut her short with trivial conversation.  Arm in arm, they returned 

together to the train, talking he knew not what, made the journey 

back in the same carriage, sat down to dinner, and passed the 

evening in the drawing-room as in the past.  But suspense and fear 

drummed in the dreamer's bosom.  "She has not denounced me yet" - 

so his thoughts ran - "when will she denounce me?  Will it be to-

morrow?"  And it was not to-morrow, nor the next day, nor the next; 

and their life settled back on the old terms, only that she seemed 

kinder than before, and that, as for him, the burthen of his 

suspense and wonder grew daily more unbearable, so that he wasted 

away like a man with a disease.  Once, indeed, he broke all bounds 

of decency, seized an occasion when she was abroad, ransacked her 

room, and at last, hidden away among her jewels, found the damning 

evidence.  There he stood, holding this thing, which was his life, 

in the hollow of his hand, and marvelling at her inconsequent 

behaviour, that she should seek, and keep, and yet not use it; and 

then the door opened, and behold herself.  So, once more, they 

stood, eye to eye, with the evidence between them; and once more 

she raised to him a face brimming with some communication; and once 

more he shied away from speech and cut her off.  But before he left 

the room, which he had turned upside down, he laid back his death-

warrant where he had found it; and at that, her face lighted up.  

The next thing he heard, she was explaining to her maid, with some 

ingenious falsehood, the disorder of her things.  Flesh and blood 

could bear the strain no longer; and I think it was the next 

morning (though chronology is always hazy in the theatre of the 

mind) that he burst from his reserve.  They had been breakfasting 

together in one corner of a great, parqueted, sparely-furnished 

room of many windows; all the time of the meal she had tortured him 

with sly allusions; and no sooner were the servants gone, and these 

two protagonists alone together, than he leaped to his feet.  She 

too sprang up, with a pale face; with a pale face, she heard him as 

he raved out his complaint:  Why did she torture him so? she knew 

all, she knew he was no enemy to her; why did she not denounce him 

at once? what signified her whole behaviour? why did she torture 

him? and yet again, why did she torture him?  And when he had done, 

she fell upon her knees, and with outstretched hands:   "Do you not 

understand?" she cried.  "I love you!"



Hereupon, with a pang of wonder and mercantile delight, the dreamer 

awoke.  His mercantile delight was not of long endurance; for it 

soon became plain that in this spirited tale there were 

unmarketable elements; which is just the reason why you have it 

here so briefly told.  But his wonder has still kept growing; and I 

think the reader's will also, if he consider it ripely.  For now he 

sees why I speak of the little people as of substantive inventors 

and performers.  To the end they had kept their secret.  I will go 

bail for the dreamer (having excellent grounds for valuing his 

candour) that he had no guess whatever at the motive of the woman - 

the hinge of the whole well-invented plot - until the instant of 

that highly dramatic declaration.  It was not his tale; it was the 

little people's!  And observe:  not only was the secret kept, the 

story was told with really guileful craftsmanship.  The conduct of 

both actors is (in the cant phrase) psychologically correct, and 

the emotion aptly graduated up to the surprising climax.  I am 

awake now, and I know this trade; and yet I cannot better it.  I am 

awake, and I live by this business; and yet I could not outdo - 

could not perhaps equal - that crafty artifice (as of some old, 

experienced carpenter of plays, some Dennery or Sardou) by which 

the same situation is twice presented and the two actors twice 

brought face to face over the evidence, only once it is in her 

hand, once in his - and these in their due order, the least 

dramatic first.  The more I think of it, the more I am moved to 

press upon the world my question:  Who are the Little People?  They 

are near connections of the dreamer's, beyond doubt; they share in 

his financial worries and have an eye to the bank-book; they share 

plainly in his training; they have plainly learned like him to 

build the scheme of a considerate story and to arrange emotion in 

progressive order; only I think they have more talent; and one 

thing is beyond doubt, they can tell him a story piece by piece, 

like a serial, and keep him all the while in ignorance of where 

they aim.  Who are they, then? and who is the dreamer?



Well, as regards the dreamer, I can answer that, for he is no less 

a person than myself; - as I might have told you from the 

beginning, only that the critics murmur over my consistent egotism; 

- and as I am positively forced to tell you now, or I could advance 

but little farther with my story.  And for the Little People, what 

shall I say they are but just my Brownies, God bless them! who do 

one-half my work for me while I am fast asleep, and in all human 

likelihood, do the rest for me as well, when I am wide awake and 

fondly suppose I do it for myself.  That part which is done while I 

am sleeping is the Brownies' part beyond contention; but that which 

is done when I am up and about is by no means necessarily mine, 

since all goes to show the Brownies have a hand in it even then.  

Here is a doubt that much concerns my conscience.  For myself - 

what I call I, my conscious ego, the denizen of the pineal gland 

unless he has changed his residence since Descartes, the man with 

the conscience and the variable bank-account, the man with the hat 

and the boots, and the privilege of voting and not carrying his 

candidate at the general elections - I am sometimes tempted to 

suppose he is no story-teller at all, but a creature as matter of 

fact as any cheesemonger or any cheese, and a realist bemired up to 

the ears in actuality; so that, by that account, the whole of my 

published fiction should be the single-handed product of some 

Brownie, some Familiar, some unseen collaborator, whom I keep 

locked in a back garret, while I get all the praise and he but a 

share (which I cannot prevent him getting) of the pudding.  I am an 

excellent adviser, something like Moliere's servant; I pull back 

and I cut down; and I dress the whole in the best words and 

sentences that I can find and make; I hold the pen, too; and I do 

the sitting at the table, which is about the worst of it; and when 

all is done, I make up the manuscript and pay for the registration; 

so that, on the whole, I have some claim to share, though not so 

largely as I do, in the profits of our common enterprise.



I can but give an instance or so of what part is done sleeping and 

what part awake, and leave the reader to share what laurels there 

are, at his own nod, between myself and my collaborators; and to do 

this I will first take a book that a number of persons have been 


polite enough to read, the STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE.  

I had long been trying to write a story on this subject, to find a 

body, a vehicle, for that strong sense of man's double being which 

must at times come in upon and overwhelm the mind of every thinking 

creature.  I had even written one, THE TRAVELLING COMPANION, which 

was returned by an editor on the plea that it was a work of genius 

and indecent, and which I burned the other day on the ground that 

it was not a work of genius, and that JEKYLL had supplanted it.  

Then came one of those financial fluctuations to which (with an 

elegant modesty) I have hitherto referred in the third person.  For 

two days I went about racking my brains for a plot of any sort; and 

on the second night I dreamed the scene at the window, and a scene 

afterward split in two, in which Hyde, pursued for some crime, took 

the powder and underwent the change in the presence of his 

pursuers.  All the rest was made awake, and consciously, although I 

think I can trace in much of it the manner of my Brownies.  The 

meaning of the tale is therefore mine, and had long pre-existed in 

my garden of Adonis, and tried one body after another in vain; 

indeed, I do most of the morality, worse luck! and my Brownies have 

not a rudiment of what we call a conscience.  Mine, too, is the 

setting, mine the characters.  All that was given me was the matter 

of three scenes, and the central idea of a voluntary change 

becoming involuntary.  Will it be thought ungenerous, after I have 

been so liberally ladling out praise to my unseen collaborators, if 

I here toss them over, bound hand and foot, into the arena of the 

critics?  For the business of the powders, which so many have 

censured, is, I am relieved to say, not mine at all but the 

Brownies'.  Of another tale, in case the reader should have glanced 

at it, I may say a word:  the not very defensible story of OLALLA.  

Here the court, the mother, the mother's niche, Olalla, Olalla's 

chamber, the meetings on the stair, the broken window, the ugly 

scene of the bite, were all given me in bulk and detail as I have 

tried to write them; to this I added only the external scenery (for 

in my dream I never was beyond the court), the portrait, the 

characters of Felipe and the priest, the moral, such as it is, and 

the last pages, such as, alas! they are.  And I may even say that 

in this case the moral itself was given me; for it arose 

immediately on a comparison of the mother and the daughter, and 

from the hideous trick of atavism in the first.  Sometimes a 

parabolic sense is still more undeniably present in a dream; 

sometimes I cannot but suppose my Brownies have been aping Bunyan, 

and yet in no case with what would possibly be called a moral in a 

tract; never with the ethical narrowness; conveying hints instead 

of life's larger limitations and that sort of sense which we seem 

to perceive in the arabesque of time and space.



For the most part, it will be seen, my Brownies are somewhat 

fantastic, like their stories hot and hot, full of passion and the 

picturesque, alive with animating incident; and they have no 

prejudice against the supernatural.  But the other day they gave me 

a surprise, entertaining me with a love-story, a little April 

comedy, which I ought certainly to hand over to the author of A 

CHANCE ACQUAINTANCE, for he could write it as it should be written, 

and I am sure (although I mean to try) that I cannot. - But who 

would have supposed that a Brownie of mine should invent a tale for 

Mr. Howells?
