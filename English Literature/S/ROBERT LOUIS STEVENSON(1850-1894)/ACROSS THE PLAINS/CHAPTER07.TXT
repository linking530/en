I





THESE boys congregated every autumn about a certain easterly 

fisher-village, where they tasted in a high degree the glory of 

existence.  The place was created seemingly on purpose for the 

diversion of young gentlemen.  A street or two of houses, mostly 

red and many of, them tiled; a number of fine trees clustered about 

the manse and the kirkyard, and turning the chief street into a 

shady alley; many little gardens more than usually bright with 

flowers; nets a-drying, and fisher-wives scolding in the backward 

parts; a smell of fish, a genial smell of seaweed; whiffs of 

blowing sand at the street-corners; shops with golf-balls and 

bottled lollipops; another shop with penny pickwicks (that 

remarkable cigar) and the LONDON JOURNAL, dear to me for its 

startling pictures, and a few novels, dear for their suggestive 

names:  such, as well as memory serves me, were the ingredients of 

the town.  These, you are to conceive posted on a spit between two 

sandy bays, and sparsely flanked with villas enough for the boys to 

lodge in with their subsidiary parents, not enough (not yet enough) 

to cocknify the scene:  a haven in the rocks in front:  in front of 

that, a file of gray islets:  to the left, endless links and sand 

wreaths, a wilderness of hiding-holes, alive with popping rabbits 

and soaring gulls:  to the right, a range of seaward crags, one 

rugged brow beyond another; the ruins of a mighty and ancient 

fortress on the brink of one; coves between - now charmed into 

sunshine quiet, now whistling with wind and clamorous with bursting 

surges; the dens and sheltered hollows redolent of thyme and 

southernwood, the air at the cliff's edge brisk and clean and 

pungent of the sea - in front of all, the Bass Rock, tilted seaward 

like a doubtful bather, the surf ringing it with white, the solan-

geese hanging round its summit like a great and glittering smoke.  

This choice piece of seaboard was sacred, besides, to the wrecker; 

and the Bass, in the eye of fancy, still flew the colours of King 

James; and in the ear of fancy the arches of Tantallon still rang 

with horse-shoe iron, and echoed to the commands of Bell-the-Cat.



There was nothing to mar your days, if you were a boy summering in 

that part, but the embarrassment of pleasure.  You might golf if 

you wanted; but I seem to have been better employed.  You might 

secrete yourself in the Lady's Walk, a certain sunless dingle of 

elders, all mossed over by the damp as green as grass, and dotted 

here and there by the stream-side with roofless walls, the cold 

homes of anchorites.  To fit themselves for life, and with a 

special eye to acquire the art of smoking, it was even common for 

the boys to harbour there; and you might have seen a single penny 

pickwick, honestly shared in lengths with a blunt knife, bestrew 

the glen with these apprentices.  Again, you might join our fishing 

parties, where we sat perched as thick as solan-geese, a covey of 

little anglers, boy and girl, angling over each other's heads, to 

the to the much entanglement of lines and loss of podleys and 

consequent shrill recrimination - shrill as the geese themselves.  

Indeed, had that been all, you might have done this often; but 

though fishing be a fine pastime, the podley is scarce to be 

regarded as a dainty for the table; and it was a point of honour 

that a boy should eat all that he had taken.  Or again, you might 

climb the Law, where the whale's jawbone stood landmark in the 

buzzing wind, and behold the face of many counties, and the smoke 

and spires of many towns, and the sails of distant ships.  You 

might bathe, now in the flaws of fine weather, that we pathetically 

call our summer, now in a gale of wind, with the sand scourging 

your bare hide, your clothes thrashing abroad from underneath their 

guardian stone, the froth of the great breakers casting you 

headlong ere it had drowned your knees.  Or you might explore the 

tidal rocks, above all in the ebb of springs, when the very roots 

of the hills were for the nonce discovered; following my leader 

from one group to another, groping in slippery tangle for the wreck 

of ships, wading in pools after the abominable creatures of the 

sea, and ever with an eye cast backward on the march off the tide 

and the menaced line of your retreat.  And then you might go 

Crusoeing, a word that covers all extempore eating in the open air:  

digging perhaps a house under the margin of the links, kindling a 

fire of the sea-ware, and cooking apples there - if they were truly 

apples, for I sometimes suppose the merchant must have played us 

off with some inferior and quite local fruit capable of resolving, 

in the neighbourhood of fire, into mere sand and smoke and iodine; 

or perhaps pushing to Tantallon, you might lunch on sandwiches and 

visions in the grassy court, while the wind hummed in the crumbling 

turrets; or clambering along the coast, eat geans (the worst, I 

must suppose, in Christendom) from an adventurous gean tree that 

had taken root under a cliff, where it was shaken with an ague of 

east wind, and silvered after gales with salt, and grew so foreign 

among its bleak surroundings that to eat of its produce was an 

adventure in itself.



There are mingled some dismal memories with so many that were 

joyous.  Of the fisher-wife, for instance, who had cut her throat 

at Canty Bay; and of how I ran with the other children to the top 

of the Quadrant, and beheld a posse of silent people escorting a 

cart, and on the cart, bound in a chair, her throat bandaged, and 

the bandage all bloody - horror! - the fisher-wife herself, who 

continued thenceforth to hag-ride my thoughts, and even to-day (as 

I recall the scene) darkens daylight.  She was lodged in the little 

old jail in the chief street; but whether or no she died there, 

with a wise terror of the worst, I never inquired.  She had been 

tippling; it was but a dingy tragedy; and it seems strange and hard 

that, after all these years, the poor crazy sinner should be still 

pilloried on her cart in the scrap-book of my memory.  Nor shall I 

readily forget a certain house in the Quadrant where a visitor 

died, and a dark old woman continued to dwell alone with the dead 

body; nor how this old woman conceived a hatred to myself and one 

of my cousins, and in the dread hour of the dusk, as we were 

clambering on the garden-walls, opened a window in that house of 

mortality and cursed us in a shrill voice and with a marrowy choice 

of language.  It was a pair of very colourless urchins that fled 

down the lane from this remarkable experience!  But I recall with a 

more doubtful sentiment, compounded out of fear and exultation, the 

coil of equinoctial tempests; trumpeting squalls, scouring flaws of 

rain; the boats with their reefed lugsails scudding for the harbour 

mouth, where danger lay, for it was hard to make when the wind had 

any east in it; the wives clustered with blowing shawls at the 

pier-head, where (if fate was against them) they might see boat and 

husband and sons - their whole wealth and their whole family - 

engulfed under their eyes; and (what I saw but once) a troop of 

neighbours forcing such an unfortunate homeward, and she squalling 

and battling in their midst, a figure scarcely human, a tragic 

Maenad.



These are things that I recall with interest; but what my memory 

dwells upon the most, I have been all this while withholding.  It 

was a sport peculiar to the place, and indeed to a week or so of 

our two months' holiday there.  Maybe it still flourishes in its 

native spot; for boys and their pastimes are swayed by periodic 

forces inscrutable to man; so that tops and marbles reappear in 

their due season, regular like the sun and moon; and the harmless 

art of knucklebones has seen the fall of the Roman empire and the 

rise of the United States.  It may still flourish in its native 

spot, but nowhere else, I am persuaded; for I tried myself to 

introduce it on Tweedside, and was defeated lamentably; its charm 

being quite local, like a country wine that cannot be exported.



The idle manner of it was this:-



Toward the end of September, when school-time was drawing near and 

the nights were already black, we would begin to sally from our-

respective villas, each equipped with a tin bull's-eye lantern.  

The thing was so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce 

of Great Britain; and the grocers, about the due time, began to 

garnish their windows with our particular brand of luminary.  We 

wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket belt, and over them, 

such was the rigour of the game, a buttoned top-coat.  They smelled 

noisomely of blistered tin; they never burned aright, though they 

would always burn our fingers; their use was naught; the pleasure 

of them merely fanciful; and yet a boy with a bull's-eye under his 

top-coat asked for nothing more.  The fishermen used lanterns about 

their boats, and it was from them, I suppose, that we had got the 

hint; but theirs were not bull's-eyes, nor did we ever play at 

being fishermen.  The police carried them at their belts, and we 

had plainly copied them in that; yet we did not pretend to be 

policemen.  Burglars, indeed, we may have had some haunting 

thoughts of; and we had certainly an eye to past ages when lanterns 

were more common, and to certain story-books in which we had found 

them to figure very largely.  But take it for all in all, the 

pleasure of the thing was substantive; and to be a boy with a 

bull's-eye under his top-coat was good enough for us.



When two of these asses met, there would be an anxious "Have you 

got your lantern?" and a gratified "Yes!" That was the shibboleth, 

and very needful too; for, as it was the rule to keep our glory 

contained, none could recognise a lantern-bearer, unless (like the 

polecat) by the smell.  Four or five would sometimes climb into the 

belly of a ten-man lugger, with nothing but the thwarts above them 

- for the cabin was usually locked, or choose out some hollow of 

the links where the wind might whistle overhead.  There the coats 

would be unbuttoned and the bull's-eyes discovered; and in the 

chequering glimmer, under the huge windy hall of the night, and 

cheered by a rich steam of toasting tinware, these fortunate young 

gentlemen would crouch together in the cold sand of the links or on 

the scaly bilges of the fishing-boat, and delight themselves with 

inappropriate talk.  Woe is me that I may not give some specimens - 

some of their foresights of life, or deep inquiries into the 

rudiments of man and nature, these were so fiery and so innocent, 

they were so richly silly, so romantically young.  But the talk, at 

any rate, was but a condiment; and these gatherings themselves only 

accidents in the career of the lantern-bearer.  The essence of this 

bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night; the slide shut, 

the top-coat buttoned; not a ray escaping, whether to conduct your 

footsteps or to make your glory public:  a mere pillar of darkness 

in the dark; and all the while, deep down in the privacy of your 

fool's heart, to know you had a bull's-eye at your belt, and to 

exult and sing over the knowledge.





II





It is said that a poet has died young in the breast of the most 

stolid.  It may be contended, rather, that this (somewhat minor) 

bard in almost every case survives, and is the spice of life to his 

possessor.  Justice is not done to the versatility and the 

unplumbed childishness of man's imagination.  His life from without 

may seem but a rude mound of mud; there will be some golden chamber 

at the heart of it, in which he dwells delighted; and for as dark 

as his pathway seems to the observer, he will have some kind of a 

bull's-eye at his belt.



It would be hard to pick out a career more cheerless than that of 

Dancer, the miser, as he figures in the "Old Bailey Reports," a 

prey to the most sordid persecutions, the butt of his 

neighbourhood, betrayed by his hired man, his house beleaguered by 

the impish schoolboy, and he himself grinding and fuming and 

impotently fleeing to the law against these pin-pricks.  You marvel 

at first that any one should willingly prolong a life so destitute 

of charm and dignity; and then you call to memory that had he 

chosen, had he ceased to be a miser, he could have been freed at 

once from these trials, and might have built himself a castle and 

gone escorted by a squadron.  For the love of more recondite joys, 

which we cannot estimate, which, it may be, we should envy, the man 

had willingly forgone both comfort and consideration.  "His mind to 

him a kingdom was"; and sure enough, digging into that mind, which 

seems at first a dust-heap, we unearth some priceless jewels.  For 

Dancer must have had the love of power and the disdain of using it, 

a noble character in itself; disdain of many pleasures, a chief 

part of what is commonly called wisdom; disdain of the inevitable 

end, that finest trait of mankind; scorn of men's opinions, another 

element of virtue; and at the back of all, a conscience just like 

yours and mine, whining like a cur, swindling like a thimble-

rigger, but still pointing (there or there-about) to some 

conventional standard.  Here were a cabinet portrait to which 

Hawthorne perhaps had done justice; and yet not Hawthorne either, 

for he was mildly minded, and it lay not in him to create for us 

that throb of the miser's pulse, his fretful energy of gusto, his 

vast arms of ambition clutching in he knows not what:  insatiable, 

insane, a god with a muck-rake.  Thus, at least, looking in the 

bosom of the miser, consideration detects the poet in the full tide 

of life, with more, indeed, of the poetic fire than usually goes to 

epics; and tracing that mean man about his cold hearth, and to and 

fro in his discomfortable house, spies within him a blazing bonfire 

of delight.  And so with others, who do not live by bread alone, 

but by some cherished and perhaps fantastic pleasure; who are meat 

salesmen to the external eye, and possibly to themselves are 

Shakespeares, Napoleons, or Beethovens; who have not one virtue to 

rub against another in the field of active life, and yet perhaps, 

in the life of contemplation, sit with the saints.  We see them on 

the street, and we can count their buttons; but heaven knows in 

what they pride themselves! heaven knows where they have set their 

treasure!



There is one fable that touches very near the quick of life:  the 

fable of the monk who passed into the woods, heard a bird break 

into song, hearkened for a trill or two, and found himself on his 

return a stranger at his convent gates; for he had been absent 

fifty years, and of all his comrades there survived but one to 

recognise him.  It is not only in the woods that this enchanter 

carols, though perhaps he is native there.  He sings in the most 

doleful places.  The miser hears him and chuckles, and the days are 

moments.  With no more apparatus than an ill-smelling lantern I 

have evoked him on the naked links.  All life that is not merely 

mechanical is spun out of two strands:  seeking for that bird and 

hearing him.  And it is just this that makes life so hard to value, 

and the delight of each so incommunicable.  And just a knowledge of 

this, and a remembrance of those fortunate hours in which the bird 

has sung to us, that fills us with such wonder when we turn the 

pages of the realist.  There, to be sure, we find a picture of life 

in so far as it consists of mud and of old iron, cheap desires and 

cheap fears, that which we are ashamed to remember and that which 

we are careless whether we forget; but of the note of that time-

devouring nightingale we hear no news.



The case of these writers of romance is most obscure.  They have 

been boys and youths; they have lingered outside the window of the 

beloved, who was then most probably writing to some one else; they 

have sat before a sheet of paper, and felt themselves mere 

continents of congested poetry, not one line of which would flow; 

they have walked alone in the woods, they have walked in cities 

under the countless lamps; they have been to sea, they have hated, 

they have feared, they have longed to knife a man, and maybe done 

it; the wild taste of life has stung their palate.  Or, if you deny 

them all the rest, one pleasure at least they have tasted to the 

full - their books are there to prove it - the keen pleasure of 

successful literary composition.  And yet they fill the globe with 

volumes, whose cleverness inspires me with despairing admiration, 

and whose consistent falsity to all I care to call existence, with 

despairing wrath.  If I had no better hope than to continue to 

revolve among the dreary and petty businesses, and to be moved by 

the paltry hopes and fears with which they surround and animate 

their heroes, I declare I would die now.  But there has never an 

hour of mine gone quite so dully yet; if it were spent waiting at a 

railway junction, I would have some scattering thoughts, I could 

count some grains of memory, compared to which the whole of one of 

these romances seems but dross.



These writers would retort (if I take them properly) that this was 

very true; that it was the same with themselves and other persons 

of (what they call) the artistic temperament; that in this we were 

exceptional, and should apparently be ashamed of ourselves; but 

that our works must deal exclusively with (what they call) the 

average man, who was a prodigious dull fellow, and quite dead to 

all but the paltriest considerations.  I accept the issue.  We can 

only know others by ourselves.  The artistic temperament (a plague 

on the expression!) does not make us different from our fellowmen, 

or it would make us incapable of writing novels; and the average 

man (a murrain on the word!) is just like you and me, or he would 

not be average.  It was Whitman who stamped a kind of Birmingham 

sacredness upon the latter phrase; but Whitman knew very well, and 

showed very nobly, that the average man was full of joys and full 

of a poetry of his own.  And this harping on life's dulness and 

man's meanness is a loud profession of incompetence; it is one of 

two things:  the cry of the blind eye, I CANNOT SEE, or the 

complaint of the dumb tongue, I CANNOT UTTER.  To draw a life 

without delights is to prove I have not realised it.  To picture a 

man without some sort of poetry - well, it goes near to prove my 

case, for it shows an author may have little enough.  To see Dancer 

only as a dirty, old, small-minded, impotently fuming man, in a 

dirty house, besieged by Harrow boys, and probably beset by small 

attorneys, is to show myself as keen an observer as . . . the 

Harrow boys.  But these young gentlemen (with a more becoming 

modesty) were content to pluck Dancer by the coat-tails; they did 

not suppose they had surprised his secret or could put him living 

in a book:  and it is there my error would have lain.  Or say that 

in the same romance - I continue to call these books romances, in 

the hope of giving pain - say that in the same romance, which now 

begins really to take shape, I should leave to speak of Dancer, and 

follow instead the Harrow boys; and say that I came on some such 

business as that of my lantern-bearers on the links; and described 

the boys as very cold, spat upon by flurries of rain, and drearily 

surrounded, all of which they were; and their talk as silly and 

indecent, which it certainly was.  I might upon these lines, and 

had I Zola's genius, turn out, in a page or so, a gem of literary 

art, render the lantern-light with the touches of a master, and lay 

on the indecency with the ungrudging hand of love; and when all was 

done, what a triumph would my picture be of shallowness and 

dulness! how it would have missed the point! how it would have 

belied the boys!  To the ear of the stenographer, the talk is 

merely silly and indecent; but ask the boys themselves, and they 

are discussing (as it is highly proper they should) the 

possibilities of existence.  To the eye of the observer they are 

wet and cold and drearily surrounded; but ask themselves, and they 

are in the heaven of a recondite pleasure, the ground of which is 

an ill-smelling lantern.





III





For, to repeat, the ground of a man's joy is often hard to hit.  It 

may hinge at times upon a mere accessory, like the lantern; it may 

reside, like Dancer's, in the mysterious inwards of psychology.  It 

may consist with perpetual failure, and find exercise in the 

continued chase.  It has so little bond with externals (such as the 

observer scribbles in his note-book) that it may even touch them 

not; and the man's true life, for which he consents to live, lie 

altogether in the field of fancy.  The clergyman, in his spare 

hours, may be winning battles, the farmer sailing ships, the banker 

reaping triumph in the arts:  all leading another life, plying 

another trade from that they chose; like the poet's housebuilder, 

who, after all, is cased in stone,



"By his fireside, as impotent fancy prompts.

Rebuilds it to his liking."



In such a case the poetry runs underground.  The observer (poor 

soul, with his documents!) is all abroad.  For to look at the man 

is but to court deception.  We shall see the trunk from which he 

draws his nourishment; but he himself is above and abroad in the 

green dome of foliage, hummed through by winds and nested in by 

nightingales.  And the true realism were that of the poets, to 

climb up after him like a squirrel, and catch some glimpse of the 

heaven for which he lives.



And, the true realism, always and everywhere, is that of the poets:  

to find out where joy resides, and give it a voice far beyond 

singing.



For to miss the joy is to miss all.  In the joy of the actors lies 

the sense of any action.  That is the explanation, that the excuse.  

To one who has not the secret of the lanterns, the scene upon the 

links is meaningless.  And hence the haunting and truly spectral 

unreality of realistic books.  Hence, when we read the English 

realists, the incredulous wonder with which we observe the hero's 

constancy under the submerging tide of dulness, and how he bears up 

with his jibbing sweetheart, and endures the chatter of idiot 

girls, and stands by his whole unfeatured wilderness of an 

existence, instead of seeking relief in drink or foreign travel.  

Hence in the French, in that meat-market of middle-aged sensuality, 

the disgusted surprise with which we see the hero drift sidelong, 

and practically quite untempted, into every description of 

misconduct and dishonour.  In each, we miss the personal poetry, 

the enchanted atmosphere, that rainbow work of fancy that clothes 

what is naked and seems to ennoble what is base; in each, life 

falls dead like dough, instead of soaring away like a balloon into 

the colours of the sunset; each is true, each inconceivable; for no 

man lives in the external truth, among salts and acids, but in the 

warm, phantasmagoric chamber of his brain, with the painted windows 

and the storied walls.



Of this falsity we have had a recent example from a man who knows 

far better - Tolstoi's POWERS OF DARKNESS.  Here is a piece full of 

force and truth, yet quite untrue.  For before Mikita was led into 

so dire a situation he was tempted, and temptations are beautiful 

at least in part; and a work which dwells on the ugliness of crime 

and gives no hint of any loveliness in the temptation, sins against 

the modesty of life, and even when a Tolstoi writes it, sinks to 

melodrama.  The peasants are not understood; they saw their life in 

fairer colours; even the deaf girl was clothed in poetry for 

Mikita, or he had never fallen.  And so, once again, even an Old 

Bailey melodrama, without some brightness of poetry and lustre of 

existence, falls into the inconceivable and ranks with fairy tales.





IV





In nobler books we are moved with something like the emotions of 

life; and this emotion is very variously provoked.  We are so moved 

when Levine labours in the field, when Andre sinks beyond emotion, 

when Richard Feverel and Lucy Desborough meet beside the river, 

when Antony, "not cowardly, puts off his helmet," when Kent has 

infinite pity on the dying Lear, when, in Dostoieffky's DESPISED 

AND REJECTED, the uncomplaining hero drains his cup of suffering 

and virtue.  These are notes that please the great heart of man.  

Not only love, and the fields, and the bright face of danger, but 

sacrifice and death and unmerited suffering humbly supported, touch 

in us the vein of the poetic.  We love to think of them, we long to 

try them, we are humbly hopeful that we may prove heroes also.



We have heard, perhaps, too much of lesser matters.  Here is the 

door, here is the open air.  ITUR IN ANTIQUAM SILVAM.
