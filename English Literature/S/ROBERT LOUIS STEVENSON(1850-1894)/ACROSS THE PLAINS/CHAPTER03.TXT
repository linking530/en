I





THE charm of Fontainebleau is a thing apart.  It is a place that 

people love even more than they admire.  The vigorous forest air, 

the silence, the majestic avenues of highway, the wilderness of 

tumbled boulders, the great age and dignity of certain groves - 

these are but ingredients, they are not the secret of the philtre.  

The place is sanative; the air, the light, the perfumes, and the 

shapes of things concord in happy harmony.  The artist may be idle 

and not fear the "blues."  He may dally with his life.  Mirth, 

lyric mirth, and a vivacious classical contentment are of the very 

essence of the better kind of art; and these, in that most smiling 

forest, he has the chance to learn or to remember.  Even on the 

plain of Biere, where the Angelus of Millet still tolls upon the 

ear of fancy, a larger air, a higher heaven, something ancient and 

healthy in the face of nature, purify the mind alike from dulness 

and hysteria.  There is no place where the young are more gladly 

conscious of their youth, or the old better contented with their 

age.



The fact of its great and special beauty further recommends this 

country to the artist.  The field was chosen by men in whose blood 

there still raced some of the gleeful or solemn exultation of great 

art - Millet who loved dignity like Michelangelo, Rousseau whose 

modern brush was dipped in the glamour of the ancients.  It was 

chosen before the day of that strange turn in the history of art, 

of which we now perceive the culmination in impressionistic tales 

and pictures - that voluntary aversion of the eye from all 

speciously strong and beautiful effects - that disinterested love 

of dulness which has set so many Peter Bells to paint the river-

side primrose.  It was then chosen for its proximity to Paris.  And 

for the same cause, and by the force of tradition, the painter of 

to-day continues to inhabit and to paint it.  There is in France 

scenery incomparable for romance and harmony.  Provence, and the 

valley of the Rhone from Vienne to Tarascon, are one succession of 

masterpieces waiting for the brush.  The beauty is not merely 

beauty; it tells, besides, a tale to the imagination, and surprises 

while it charms.  Here you shall see castellated towns that would 

befit the scenery of dreamland; streets that glow with colour like 

cathedral windows; hills of the most exquisite proportions; flowers 

of every precious colour, growing thick like grass.  All these, by 

the grace of railway travel, are brought to the very door of the 

modern painter; yet he does not seek them; he remains faithful to 

Fontainebleau, to the eternal bridge of Gretz, to the watering-pot 

cascade in Cernay valley.  Even Fontainebleau was chosen for him; 

even in Fontainebleau he shrinks from what is sharply charactered.  

But one thing, at least, is certain, whatever he may choose to 

paint and in whatever manner, it is good for the artist to dwell 

among graceful shapes.  Fontainebleau, if it be but quiet scenery, 

is classically graceful; and though the student may look for 

different qualities, this quality, silently present, will educate 

his hand and eye.



But, before all its other advantages - charm, loveliness, or 

proximity to Paris - comes the great fact that it is already 

colonised.  The institution of a painters' colony is a work of time 

and tact.  The population must be conquered.  The innkeeper has to 

be taught, and he soon learns, the lesson of unlimited credit; he 

must be taught to welcome as a favoured guest a young gentleman in 

a very greasy coat, and with little baggage beyond a box of colours 

and a canvas; and he must learn to preserve his faith in customers 

who will eat heartily and drink of the best, borrow money to buy 

tobacco, and perhaps not pay a stiver for a year.  A colour 

merchant has next to be attracted.  A certain vogue must be given 

to the place, lest the painter, most gregarious of animals, should 

find himself alone.  And no sooner are these first difficulties 

overcome, than fresh perils spring up upon the other side; and the 

bourgeois and the tourist are knocking at the gate.  This is the 

crucial moment for the colony.  If these intruders gain a footing, 

they not only banish freedom and amenity; pretty soon, by means of 

their long purses, they will have undone the education of the 

innkeeper; prices will rise and credit shorten; and the poor 

painter must fare farther on and find another hamlet.  "Not here, O 

Apollo!" will become his song.  Thus Trouville and, the other day, 

St. Raphael were lost to the arts.  Curious and not always edifying 

are the shifts that the French student uses to defend his lair; 

like the cuttlefish, he must sometimes blacken the waters of his 

chosen pool; but at such a time and for so practical a purpose Mrs. 

Grundy must allow him licence.  Where his own purse and credit are 

not threatened, he will do the honours of his village generously.  

Any artist is made welcome, through whatever medium he may seek 

expression; science is respected; even the idler, if he prove, as 

he so rarely does, a gentleman, will soon begin to find himself at 

home.  And when that essentially modern creature, the English or 

American girl-student, began to walk calmly into his favourite inns 

as if into a drawing-room at home, the French painter owned himself 

defenceless; he submitted or he fled.  His French respectability, 

quite as precise as ours, though covering different provinces of 

life, recoiled aghast before the innovation.  But the girls were 

painters; there was nothing to be done; and Barbizon, when I last 

saw it and for the time at least, was practically ceded to the fair 

invader.  Paterfamilias, on the other hand, the common tourist, the 

holiday shopman, and the cheap young gentleman upon the spree, he 

hounded from his villages with every circumstance of contumely.



This purely artistic society is excellent for the young artist.  

The lads are mostly fools; they hold the latest orthodoxy in its 

crudeness; they are at that stage of education, for the most part, 

when a man is too much occupied with style to be aware of the 

necessity for any matter; and this, above all for the Englishman, 

is excellent.  To work grossly at the trade, to forget sentiment, 

to think of his material and nothing else, is, for awhile at least, 

the king's highway of progress.  Here, in England, too many 

painters and writers dwell dispersed, unshielded, among the 

intelligent bourgeois.  These, when they are not merely 

indifferent, prate to him about the lofty aims and moral influence 

of art.  And this is the lad's ruin.  For art is, first of all and 

last of all, a trade.  The love of words and not a desire to 

publish new discoveries, the love of form and not a novel reading 

of historical events, mark the vocation of the writer and the 

painter.  The arabesque, properly speaking, and even in literature, 

is the first fancy of the artist; he first plays with his material 

as a child plays with a kaleidoscope; and he is already in a second 

stage when he begins to use his pretty counters for the end of 

representation.  In that, he must pause long and toil faithfully; 

that is his apprenticeship; and it is only the few who will really 

grow beyond it, and go forward, fully equipped, to do the business 

of real art - to give life to abstractions and significance and 

charm to facts.  In the meanwhile, let him dwell much among his 

fellow-craftsmen.  They alone can take a serious interest in the 

childish tasks and pitiful successes of these years.  They alone 

can behold with equanimity this fingering of the dumb keyboard, 

this polishing of empty sentences, this dull and literal painting 

of dull and insignificant subjects.  Outsiders will spur him on.  

They will say, "Why do you not write a great book? paint a great 

picture?"  If his guardian angel fail him, they may even persuade 

him to the attempt, and, ten to one, his hand is coarsened and his 

style falsified for life.



And this brings me to a warning.  The life of the apprentice to any 

art is both unstrained and pleasing; it is strewn with small 

successes in the midst of a career of failure, patiently supported; 

the heaviest scholar is conscious of a certain progress; and if he 

come not appreciably nearer to the art of Shakespeare, grows 

letter-perfect in the domain of A-B, ab.  But the time comes when a 

man should cease prelusory gymnastic, stand up, put a violence upon 

his will, and, for better or worse, begin the business of creation.  

This evil day there is a tendency continually to postpone:  above 

all with painters.  They have made so many studies that it has 

become a habit; they make more, the walls of exhibitions blush with 

them; and death finds these aged students still busy with their 

horn-book.  This class of man finds a congenial home in artist 

villages; in the slang of the English colony at Barbizon we used to 

call them "Snoozers."  Continual returns to the city, the society 

of men farther advanced, the study of great works, a sense of 

humour or, if such a thing is to be had, a little religion or 

philosophy, are the means of treatment.  It will be time enough to 

think of curing the malady after it has been caught; for to catch 

it is the very thing for which you seek that dream-land of the 

painters' village.  "Snoozing" is a part of the artistic education; 

and the rudiments must be learned stupidly, all else being 

forgotten, as if they were an object in themselves.



Lastly, there is something, or there seems to be something, in the 

very air of France that communicates the love of style.  Precision, 

clarity, the cleanly and crafty employment of material, a grace in 

the handling, apart from any value in the thought, seem to be 

acquired by the mere residence; or if not acquired, become at least 

the more appreciated.  The air of Paris is alive with this 

technical inspiration.  And to leave that airy city and awake next 

day upon the borders of the forest is but to change externals.  The 

same spirit of dexterity and finish breathes from the long alleys 

and the lofty groves, from the wildernesses that are still pretty 

in their confusion, and the great plain that contrives to be 

decorative in its emptiness.





II





In spite of its really considerable extent, the forest of 

Fontainebleau is hardly anywhere tedious.  I know the whole western 

side of it with what, I suppose, I may call thoroughness; well 

enough at least to testify that there is no square mile without 

some special character and charm.  Such quarters, for instance, as 

the Long Rocher, the Bas-Breau, and the Reine Blanche, might be a 

hundred miles apart; they have scarce a point in common beyond the 

silence of the birds.  The two last are really conterminous; and in 

both are tall and ancient trees that have outlived a thousand 

political vicissitudes.  But in the one the great oaks prosper 

placidly upon an even floor; they beshadow a great field; and the 

air and the light are very free below their stretching boughs.  In 

the other the trees find difficult footing; castles of white rock 

lie tumbled one upon another, the foot slips, the crooked viper 

slumbers, the moss clings in the crevice; and above it all the 

great beech goes spiring and casting forth her arms, and, with a 

grace beyond church architecture, canopies this rugged chaos.  

Meanwhile, dividing the two cantons, the broad white causeway of 

the Paris road runs in an avenue:  a road conceived for pageantry 

and for triumphal marches, an avenue for an army; but, its days of 

glory over, it now lies grilling in the sun between cool groves, 

and only at intervals the vehicle of the cruising tourist is seen 

far away and faintly audible along its ample sweep.  A little upon 

one side, and you find a district of sand and birch and boulder; a 

little upon the other lies the valley of Apremont, all juniper and 

heather; and close beyond that you may walk into a zone of pine 

trees.  So artfully are the ingredients mingled.  Nor must it be 

forgotten that, in all this part, you come continually forth upon a 

hill-top, and behold the plain, northward and westward, like an 

unrefulgent sea; nor that all day long the shadows keep changing; 

and at last, to the red fires of sunset, night succeeds, and with 

the night a new forest, full of whisper, gloom, and fragrance.  

There are few things more renovating than to leave Paris, the 

lamplit arches of the Carrousel, and the long alignment of the 

glittering streets, and to bathe the senses in this fragrant 

darkness of the wood.



In this continual variety the mind is kept vividly alive.  It is a 

changeful place to paint, a stirring place to live in.  As fast as 

your foot carries you, you pass from scene to scene, each 

vigorously painted in the colours of the sun, each endeared by that 

hereditary spell of forests on the mind of man who still remembers 

and salutes the ancient refuge of his race.



And yet the forest has been civilised throughout.  The most savage 

corners bear a name, and have been cherished like antiquities; in 

the most remote, Nature has prepared and balanced her effects as if 

with conscious art; and man, with his guiding arrows of blue paint, 

has countersigned the picture.  After your farthest wandering, you 

are never surprised to come forth upon the vast avenue of highway, 

to strike the centre point of branching alleys, or to find the 

aqueduct trailing, thousand-footed, through the brush.  It is not a 

wilderness; it is rather a preserve.  And, fitly enough, the centre 

of the maze is not a hermit's cavern.  In the midst, a little 

mirthful town lies sunlit, humming with the business of pleasure; 

and the palace, breathing distinction and peopled by historic 

names, stands smokeless among gardens.



Perhaps the last attempt at savage life was that of the harmless 

humbug who called himself the hermit.  In a great tree, close by 

the highroad, he had built himself a little cabin after the manner 

of the Swiss Family Robinson; thither he mounted at night, by the 

romantic aid of a rope ladder; and if dirt be any proof of 

sincerity, the man was savage as a Sioux.  I had the pleasure of 

his acquaintance; he appeared grossly stupid, not in his perfect 

wits, and interested in nothing but small change; for that he had a 

great avidity.  In the course of time he proved to be a chicken-

stealer, and vanished from his perch; and perhaps from the first he 

was no true votary of forest freedom, but an ingenious, 

theatrically-minded beggar, and his cabin in the tree was only 

stock-in-trade to beg withal.  The choice of his position would 

seem to indicate so much; for if in the forest there are no places 

still to be discovered, there are many that have been forgotten, 

and that lie unvisited.  There, to be sure, are the blue arrows 

waiting to reconduct you, now blazed upon a tree, now posted in the 

corner of a rock.  But your security from interruption is complete; 

you might camp for weeks, if there were only water, and not a soul 

suspect your presence; and if I may suppose the reader to have 

committed some great crime and come to me for aid, I think I could 

still find my way to a small cavern, fitted with a hearth and 

chimney, where he might lie perfectly concealed.  A confederate 

landscape-painter might daily supply him with food; for water, he 

would have to make a nightly tramp as far as to the nearest pond; 

and at last, when the hue and cry began to blow over, he might get 

gently on the train at some side station, work round by a series of 

junctions, and be quietly captured at the frontier.



Thus Fontainebleau, although it is truly but a pleasure-ground, and 

although, in favourable weather, and in the more celebrated 

quarters, it literally buzzes with the tourist, yet has some of the 

immunities and offers some of the repose of natural forests.  And 

the solitary, although he must return at night to his frequented 

inn, may yet pass the day with his own thoughts in the 

companionable silence of the trees.  The demands of the imagination 

vary; some can be alone in a back garden looked upon by windows; 

others, like the ostrich, are content with a solitude that meets 

the eye; and others, again, expand in fancy to the very borders of 

their desert, and are irritably conscious of a hunter's camp in an 

adjacent county.  To these last, of course, Fontainebleau will seem 

but an extended tea-garden:  a Rosherville on a by-day.  But to the 

plain man it offers solitude:  an excellent thing in itself, and a 

good whet for company.





III





I was for some time a consistent Barbizonian; ET EGO IN ARCADIA 

VIXI, it was a pleasant season; and that noiseless hamlet lying 

close among the borders of the wood is for me, as for so many 

others, a green spot in memory.  The great Millet was just dead, 

the green shutters of his modest house were closed; his daughters 

were in mourning.  The date of my first visit was thus an epoch in 

the history of art:  in a lesser way, it was an epoch in the 

history of the Latin Quarter.  The PETIT CENACLE was dead and 

buried; Murger and his crew of sponging vagabonds were all at rest 

from their expedients; the tradition of their real life was nearly 

lost; and the petrified legend of the VIE DE BOHEME had become a 

sort of gospel, and still gave the cue to zealous imitators.  But 

if the book be written in rose-water, the imitation was still 

farther expurgated; honesty was the rule; the innkeepers gave, as I 

have said, almost unlimited credit; they suffered the seediest 

painter to depart, to take all his belongings, and to leave his 

bill unpaid; and if they sometimes lost, it was by English and 

Americans alone.  At the same time, the great influx of Anglo-

Saxons had begun to affect the life of the studious.  There had 

been disputes; and, in one instance at least, the English and the 

Americans had made common cause to prevent a cruel pleasantry.  It 

would be well if nations and races could communicate their 

qualities; but in practice when they look upon each other, they 

have an eye to nothing but defects.  The Anglo-Saxon is essentially 

dishonest; the French is devoid by nature of the principle that we 

call "Fair Play."  The Frenchman marvelled at the scruples of his 

guest, and, when that defender of innocence retired over-seas and 

left his bills unpaid, he marvelled once again; the good and evil 

were, in his eyes, part and parcel of the same eccentricity; a 

shrug expressed his judgment upon both.



At Barbizon there was no master, no pontiff in the arts.  Palizzi 

bore rule at Gretz - urbane, superior rule - his memory rich in 

anecdotes of the great men of yore, his mind fertile in theories; 

sceptical, composed, and venerable to the eye; and yet beneath 

these outworks, all twittering with Italian superstition, his eye 

scouting for omens, and the whole fabric of his manners giving way 

on the appearance of a hunchback.  Cernay had Pelouse, the 

admirable, placid Pelouse, smilingly critical of youth, who, when a 

full-blown commercial traveller, suddenly threw down his samples, 

bought a colour-box, and became the master whom we have all 

admired.  Marlotte, for a central figure, boasted Olivier de Penne.  

Only Barbizon, since the death of Millet, was a headless 

commonwealth.  Even its secondary lights, and those who in my day 

made the stranger welcome, have since deserted it.  The good 

Lachevre has departed, carrying his household gods; and long before 

that Gaston Lafenestre was taken from our midst by an untimely 

death.  He died before he had deserved success; it may be, he would 

never have deserved it; but his kind, comely, modest countenance 

still haunts the memory of all who knew him.  Another - whom I will 

not name - has moved farther on, pursuing the strange Odyssey of 

his decadence.  His days of royal favour had departed even then; 

but he still retained, in his narrower life at Barbizon, a certain 

stamp of conscious importance, hearty, friendly, filling the room, 

the occupant of several chairs; nor had he yet ceased his losing 

battle, still labouring upon great canvases that none would buy, 

still waiting the return of fortune.  But these days also were too 

good to last; and the former favourite of two sovereigns fled, if I 

heard the truth, by night.  There was a time when he was counted a 

great man, and Millet but a dauber; behold, how the whirligig of 

time brings in his revenges!  To pity Millet is a piece of 

arrogance; if life be hard for such resolute and pious spirits, it 

is harder still for us, had we the wit to understand it; but we may 

pity his unhappier rival, who, for no apparent merit, was raised to 

opulence and momentary fame, and, through no apparent fault was 

suffered step by step to sink again to nothing.  No misfortune can 

exceed the bitterness of such back-foremost progress, even bravely 

supported as it was; but to those also who were taken early from 

the easel, a regret is due.  From all the young men of this period, 

one stood out by the vigour of his promise; he was in the age of 

fermentation, enamoured of eccentricities.  "Il faut faire de la 

peinture nouvelle," was his watchword; but if time and experience 

had continued his education, if he had been granted health to 

return from these excursions to the steady and the central, I must 

believe that the name of Hills had become famous.



Siron's inn, that excellent artists' barrack, was managed upon easy 

principles.  At any hour of the night, when you returned from 

wandering in the forest, you went to the billiard-room and helped 

yourself to liquors, or descended to the cellar and returned laden 

with beer or wine.  The Sirons were all locked in slumber; there 

was none to check your inroads; only at the week's end a 

computation was made, the gross sum was divided, and a varying 

share set down to every lodger's name under the rubric:  ESTRATS.  

Upon the more long-suffering the larger tax was levied; and your 

bill lengthened in a direct proportion to the easiness of your 

disposition.  At any hour of the morning, again, you could get your 

coffee or cold milk, and set forth into the forest.  The doves had 

perhaps wakened you, fluttering into your chamber; and on the 

threshold of the inn you were met by the aroma of the forest.  

Close by were the great aisles, the mossy boulders, the 

interminable field of forest shadow.  There you were free to dream 

and wander.  And at noon, and again at six o'clock, a good meal 

awaited you on Siron's table.  The whole of your accommodation, set 

aside that varying item of the ESTRALS, cost you five francs a day; 

your bill was never offered you until you asked it; and if you were 

out of luck's way, you might depart for where you pleased and leave 

it pending.





IV





Theoretically, the house was open to all corners; practically, it 

was a kind of club.  The guests protected themselves, and, in so 

doing, they protected Siron.  Formal manners being laid aside, 

essential courtesy was the more rigidly exacted; the new arrival 

had to feel the pulse of the society; and a breach of its undefined 

observances was promptly punished.  A man might be as plain, as 

dull, as slovenly, as free of speech as he desired; but to a touch 

of presumption or a word of hectoring these free Barbizonians were 

as sensitive as a tea-party of maiden ladies.  I have seen people 

driven forth from Barbizon; it would be difficult to say in words 

what they had done, but they deserved their fate.  They had shown 

themselves unworthy to enjoy these corporate freedoms; they had 

pushed themselves; they had "made their head"; they wanted tact to 

appreciate the "fine shades" of Barbizonian etiquette.  And once 

they were condemned, the process of extrusion was ruthless in its 

cruelty; after one evening with the formidable Bodmer, the Baily of 

our commonwealth, the erring stranger was beheld no more; he rose 

exceeding early the next day, and the first coach conveyed him from 

the scene of his discomfiture.  These sentences of banishment were 

never, in my knowledge, delivered against an artist; such would, I 

believe, have been illegal; but the odd and pleasant fact is this, 

that they were never needed.  Painters, sculptors, writers, 

singers, I have seen all of these in Barbizon; and some were sulky, 

and some blatant and inane; but one and all entered at once into 

the spirit of the association.  This singular society is purely 

French, a creature of French virtues, and possibly of French 

defects.  It cannot be imitated by the English.  The roughness, the 

impatience, the more obvious selfishness, and even the more ardent 

friendships of the Anglo-Saxon, speedily dismember such a 

commonwealth.  But this random gathering of young French painters, 

with neither apparatus nor parade of government, yet kept the life 

of the place upon a certain footing, insensibly imposed their 

etiquette upon the docile, and by caustic speech enforced their 

edicts against the unwelcome.  To think of it is to wonder the more 

at the strange failure of their race upon the larger theatre.  This 

inbred civility - to use the word in its completest meaning - this 

natural and facile adjustment of contending liberties, seems all 

that is required to make a governable nation and a just and 

prosperous country.



Our society, thus purged and guarded, was full of high spirits, of 

laughter, and of the initiative of youth.  The few elder men who 

joined us were still young at heart, and took the key from their 

companions.  We returned from long stations in the fortifying air, 

our blood renewed by the sunshine, our spirits refreshed by the 

silence of the forest; the Babel of loud voices sounded good; we 

fell to eat and play like the natural man; and in the high inn 

chamber, panelled with indifferent pictures and lit by candles 

guttering in the night air, the talk and laughter sounded far into 

the night.  It was a good place and a good life for any naturally-

minded youth; better yet for the student of painting, and perhaps 

best of all for the student of letters.  He, too, was saturated in 

this atmosphere of style; he was shut out from the disturbing 

currents of the world, he might forget that there existed other and 

more pressing interests than that of art.  But, in such a place, it 

was hardly possible to write; he could not drug his conscience, 

like the painter, by the production of listless studies; he saw 

himself idle among many who were apparently, and some who were 

really, employed; and what with the impulse of increasing health 

and the continual provocation of romantic scenes, he became 

tormented with the desire to work.  He enjoyed a strenuous idleness 

full of visions, hearty meals, long, sweltering walks, mirth among 

companions; and still floating like music through his brain, 

foresights of great works that Shakespeare might be proud to have 

conceived, headless epics, glorious torsos of dramas, and words 

that were alive with import.  So in youth, like Moses from the 

mountain, we have sights of that House Beautiful of art which we 

shall never enter.  They are dreams and unsubstantial; visions of 

style that repose upon no base of human meaning; the last heart-

throbs of that excited amateur who has to die in all of us before 

the artist can be born.  But they come to us in such a rainbow of 

glory that all subsequent achievement appears dull and earthly in 

comparison.  We were all artists; almost all in the age of 

illusion, cultivating an imaginary genius, and walking to the 

strains of some deceiving Ariel; small wonder, indeed, if we were 

happy!  But art, of whatever nature, is a kind mistress; and though 

these dreams of youth fall by their own baselessness, others 

succeed, graver and more substantial; the symptoms change, the 

amiable malady endures; and still, at an equal distance, the House 

Beautiful shines upon its hill-top.

Gretz lies out of the forest, down by the bright river.  It boasts 

a mill, an ancient church, a castle, and a bridge of many 

sterlings.  And the bridge is a piece of public property; 

anonymously famous; beaming on the incurious dilettante from the 

walls of a hundred exhibitions.  I have seen it in the Salon; I 

have seen it in the Academy; I have seen it in the last French 

Exposition, excellently done by Bloomer; in a black-and-white by 

Mr. A. Henley, it once adorned this essay in the pages of the 

MAGAZINE OF ART.  Long-suffering bridge!  And if you visit Gretz 

to-morrow, you shall find another generation, camped at the bottom 

of Chevillon's garden under their white umbrellas, and doggedly 

painting it again.



The bridge taken for granted, Gretz is a less inspiring place than 

Barbizon.  I give it the palm over Cernay.  There is something 

ghastly in the great empty village square of Cernay, with the inn 

tables standing in one corner, as though the stage were set for 

rustic opera, and in the early morning all the painters breaking 

their fast upon white wine under the windows of the villagers.  It 

is vastly different to awake in Gretz, to go down the green inn-

garden, to find the river streaming through the bridge, and to see 

the dawn begin across the poplared level.  The meals are laid in 

the cool arbour, under fluttering leaves.  The splash of oars and 

bathers, the bathing costumes out to dry, the trim canoes beside 

the jetty, tell of a society that has an eye to pleasure.  There is 

"something to do" at Gretz.  Perhaps, for that very reason, I can 

recall no such enduring ardours, no such glories of exhilaration, 

as among the solemn groves and uneventful hours of Barbizon.  This 

"something to do" is a great enemy to joy; it is a way out of it; 

you wreak your high spirits on some cut-and-dry employment, and 

behold them gone!  But Gretz is a merry place after its kind:  

pretty to see, merry to inhabit.  The course of its pellucid river, 

whether up or down, is full of gentle attractions for the 

navigator:  islanded reed-mazes where, in autumn, the red berries 

cluster; the mirrored and inverted images of trees, lilies, and 

mills, and the foam and thunder of weirs.  And of all noble sweeps 

of roadway, none is nobler, on a windy dusk, than the highroad to 

Nemours between its lines of talking poplar.



But even Gretz is changed.  The old inn, long shored and trussed 

and buttressed, fell at length under the mere weight of years, and 

the place as it was is but a fading image in the memory of former 

guests.  They, indeed, recall the ancient wooden stair; they recall 

the rainy evening, the wide hearth, the blaze of the twig fire, and 

the company that gathered round the pillar in the kitchen.  But the 

material fabric is now dust; soon, with the last of its 

inhabitants, its very memory shall follow; and they, in their turn, 

shall suffer the same law, and, both in name and lineament, vanish 

from the world of men.  "For remembrance of the old house' sake," 

as Pepys once quaintly put it, let me tell one story.  When the 

tide of invasion swept over France, two foreign painters were left 

stranded and penniless in Gretz; and there, until the war was over, 

the Chevillons ungrudgingly harboured them.  It was difficult to 

obtain supplies; but the two waifs were still welcome to the best, 

sat down daily with the family to table, and at the due intervals 

were supplied with clean napkins, which they scrupled to employ.  

Madame Chevillon observed the fact and reprimanded them.  But they 

stood firm; eat they must, but having no money they would soil no 

napkins.





VI





Nemours and Moret, for all they are so picturesque, have been 

little visited by painters.  They are, indeed, too populous; they 

have manners of their own, and might resist the drastic process of 

colonisation.  Montigny has been somewhat strangely neglected, I 

never knew it inhabited but once, when Will H. Low installed 

himself there with a barrel of PIQUETTE, and entertained his 

friends in a leafy trellis above the weir, in sight of the green 

country and to the music of the falling water.  It was a most airy, 

quaint, and pleasant place of residence, just too rustic to be 

stagey; and from my memories of the place in general, and that 

garden trellis in particular - at morning, visited by birds, or at 

night, when the dew fell and the stars were of the party - I am 

inclined to think perhaps too favourably of the future of Montigny.  

Chailly-en-Biere has outlived all things, and lies dustily 

slumbering in the plain - the cemetery of itself.  The great road 

remains to testify of its former bustle of postilions and carriage 

bells; and, like memorial tablets, there still hang in the inn room 

the paintings of a former generation, dead or decorated long ago.  

In my time, one man only, greatly daring, dwelt there.  From time 

to time he would walk over to Barbizon like a shade revisiting the 

glimpses of the moon, and after some communication with flesh and 

blood return to his austere hermitage.  But even he, when I last 

revisited the forest, had come to Barbizon for good, and closed the 

roll of Chaillyites.  It may revive - but I much doubt it.  Acheres 

and Recloses still wait a pioneer; Bourron is out of the question, 

being merely Gretz over again, without the river, the bridge, or 

the beauty; and of all the possible places on the western side, 

Marlotte alone remains to be discussed.  I scarcely know Marlotte, 

and, very likely for that reason, am not much in love with it.  It 

seems a glaring and unsightly hamlet.  The inn of Mother Antonie is 

unattractive; and its more reputable rival, though comfortable 

enough, is commonplace.  Marlotte has a name; it is famous; if I 

were the young painter I would leave it alone in its glory.





VII





These are the words of an old stager; and though time is a good 

conservative in forest places, much may be untrue to-day.  Many of 

us have passed Arcadian days there and moved on, but yet left a 

portion of our souls behind us buried in the woods.  I would not 

dig for these reliquiae; they are incommunicable treasures that 

will not enrich the finder; and yet there may lie, interred below 

great oaks or scattered along forest paths, stores of youth's 

dynamite and dear remembrances.  And as one generation passes on 

and renovates the field of tillage for the next, I entertain a 

fancy that when the young men of to-day go forth into the forest 

they shall find the air still vitalised by the spirits of their 

predecessors, and, like those "unheard melodies" that are the 

sweetest of all, the memory of our laughter shall still haunt the 

field of trees.  Those merry voices that in woods call the wanderer 

farther, those thrilling silences and whispers of the groves, 

surely in Fontainebleau they must be vocal of me and my companions?  

We are not content to pass away entirely from the scenes of our 

delight; we would leave, if but in gratitude, a pillar and a 

legend.



One generation after another fall like honey-bees upon this 

memorable forest, rifle its sweets, pack themselves with vital 

memories, and when the theft is consummated depart again into life 

richer, but poorer also.  The forest, indeed, they have possessed, 

from that day forward it is theirs indissolubly, and they will 

return to walk in it at night in the fondest of their dreams, and 

use it for ever in their books and pictures.  Yet when they made 

their packets, and put up their notes and sketches, something, it 

should seem, had been forgotten.  A projection of themselves shall 

appear to haunt unfriended these scenes of happiness, a natural 

child of fancy, begotten and forgotten unawares.  Over the whole 

field of our wanderings such fetches are still travelling like 

indefatigable bagmen; but the imps of Fontainebleau, as of all 

beloved spots, are very long of life, and memory is piously 

unwilling to forget their orphanage.  If anywhere about that wood 

you meet my airy bantling, greet him with tenderness.  He was a 

pleasant lad, though now abandoned.  And when it comes to your own 

turn to quit the forest, may you leave behind you such another; no 

Antony or Werther, let us hope, no tearful whipster, but, as 

becomes this not uncheerful and most active age in which we figure, 

the child of happy hours.



No art, it may be said, was ever perfect, and not many noble, that 

has not been mirthfully conceived.



And no man, it may be added, was ever anything but a wet blanket 

and a cross to his companions who boasted not a copious spirit of 

enjoyment.  Whether as man or artist let the youth make haste to 

Fontainebleau, and once there let him address himself to the spirit 

of the place; he will learn more from exercise than from studies, 

although both are necessary; and if he can get into his heart the 

gaiety and inspiration of the woods he will have gone far to undo 

the evil of his sketches.  A spirit once well strung up to the 

concert-pitch of the primeval out-of-doors will hardly dare to 

finish a study and magniloquently ticket it a picture.  The 

incommunicable thrill of things, that is the tuning-fork by which 

we test the flatness of our art.  Here it is that Nature teaches 

and condemns, and still spurs up to further effort and new failure.  

Thus it is that she sets us blushing at our ignorant and tepid 

works; and the more we find of these inspiring shocks the less 

shall we be apt to love the literal in our productions.  In all 

sciences and senses the letter kills; and to-day, when cackling 

human geese express their ignorant condemnation of all studio 

pictures, it is a lesson most useful to be learnt.  Let the young 

painter go to Fontainebleau, and while he stupefies himself with 

studies that teach him the mechanical side of his trade, let him 

walk in the great air, and be a servant of mirth, and not pick and 

botanise, but wait upon the moods of nature.  So he will learn - or 

learn not to forget - the poetry of life and earth, which, when he 

has acquired his track, will save him from joyless reproduction.
