LEAVES FROM THE NOTEBOOK OF AN EMIGRANT BETWEEN NEW YORK AND SAN 

FRANCISCO





MONDAY. - It was, if I remember rightly, five o'clock when we were 

all signalled to be present at the Ferry Depot of the railroad.  An 

emigrant ship had arrived at New York on the Saturday night, 

another on the Sunday morning, our own on Sunday afternoon, a 

fourth early on Monday; and as there is no emigrant train on Sunday 

a great part of the passengers from these four ships was 

concentrated on the train by which I was to travel.  There was a 

babel of bewildered men, women, and children.  The wretched little 

booking-office, and the baggage-room, which was not much larger, 

were crowded thick with emigrants, and were heavy and rank with the 

atmosphere of dripping clothes.  Open carts full of bedding stood 

by the half-hour in the rain.  The officials loaded each other with 

recriminations.  A bearded, mildewed little man, whom I take to 

have been an emigrant agent, was all over the place, his mouth full 

of brimstone, blustering and interfering.  It was plain that the 

whole system, if system there was, had utterly broken down under 

the strain of so many passengers.



My own ticket was given me at once, and an oldish man, who 

preserved his head in the midst of this turmoil, got my baggage 

registered, and counselled me to stay quietly where I was till he 

should give me the word to move.  I had taken along with me a small 

valise, a knapsack, which I carried on my shoulders, and in the bag 

of my railway rug the whole of BANCROFT'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED 

STATES, in six fat volumes.  It was as much as I could carry with 

convenience even for short distances, but it insured me plenty of 

clothing, and the valise was at that moment, and often after, 

useful for a stool.  I am sure I sat for an hour in the baggage-

room, and wretched enough it was; yet, when at last the word was 

passed to me and I picked up my bundles and got under way, it was 

only to exchange discomfort for downright misery and danger.



I followed the porters into a long shed reaching downhill from West 

Street to the river.  It was dark, the wind blew clean through it 

from end to end; and here I found a great block of passengers and 

baggage, hundreds of one and tons of the other.  I feel I shall 

have a difficulty to make myself believed; and certainly the scene 

must have been exceptional, for it was too dangerous for daily 

repetition.  It was a tight jam; there was no fair way through the 

mingled mass of brute and living obstruction.  Into the upper 

skirts of the crowd porters, infuriated by hurry and overwork, 

clove their way with shouts.  I may say that we stood like sheep, 

and that the porters charged among us like so many maddened sheep-

dogs; and I believe these men were no longer answerable for their 

acts.  It mattered not what they were carrying, they drove straight 

into the press, and when they could get no farther, blindly 

discharged their barrowful.  With my own hand, for instance, I 

saved the life of a child as it sat upon its mother's knee, she 

sitting on a box; and since I heard of no accident, I must suppose 

that there were many similar interpositions in the course of the 

evening.  It will give some idea of the state of mind to which we 

were reduced if I tell you that neither the porter nor the mother 

of the child paid the least attention to my act.  It was not till 

some time after that I understood what I had done myself, for to 

ward off heavy boxes seemed at the moment a natural incident of 

human life.  Cold, wet, clamour, dead opposition to progress, such 

as one encounters in an evil dream, had utterly daunted the 

spirits.  We had accepted this purgatory as a child accepts the 

conditions of the world.  For my part, I shivered a little, and my 

back ached wearily; but I believe I had neither a hope nor a fear, 

and all the activities of my nature had become tributary to one 

massive sensation of discomfort.



At length, and after how long an interval I hesitate to guess, the 

crowd began to move, heavily straining through itself.  About the 

same time some lamps were lighted, and threw a sudden flare over 

the shed.  We were being filtered out into the river boat for 

Jersey City.  You may imagine how slowly this filtering proceeded, 

through the dense, choking crush, every one overladen with packages 

or children, and yet under the necessity of fishing out his ticket 

by the way; but it ended at length for me, and I found myself on 

deck under a flimsy awning and with a trifle of elbow-room to 

stretch and breathe in.  This was on the starboard; for the bulk of 

the emigrants stuck hopelessly on the port side, by which we had 

entered.  In vain the seamen shouted to them to move on, and 

threatened them with shipwreck.  These poor people were under a 

spell of stupor, and did not stir a foot.  It rained as heavily as 

ever, but the wind now came in sudden claps and capfuls, not 

without danger to a boat so badly ballasted as ours; and we crept 

over the river in the darkness, trailing one paddle in the water 

like a wounded duck, and passed ever and again by huge, illuminated 

steamers running many knots, and heralding their approach by 

strains of music.  The contrast between these pleasure embarkations 

and our own grim vessel, with her list to port and her freight of 

wet and silent emigrants, was of that glaring description which we 

count too obvious for the purposes of art.



The landing at Jersey City was done in a stampede.  I had a fixed 

sense of calamity, and to judge by conduct, the same persuasion was 

common to us all.  A panic selfishness, like that produced by fear, 

presided over the disorder of our landing.  People pushed, and 

elbowed, and ran, their families following how they could.  

Children fell, and were picked up to be rewarded by a blow.  One 

child, who had lost her parents, screamed steadily and with 

increasing shrillness, as though verging towards a fit; an official 

kept her by him, but no one else seemed so much as to remark her 

distress; and I am ashamed to say that I ran among the rest.  I was 

so weary that I had twice to make a halt and set down my bundles in 

the hundred yards or so between the pier and the railway station, 

so that I was quite wet by the time that I got under cover.  There 

was no waiting-room, no refreshment room; the cars were locked; and 

for at least another hour, or so it seemed, we had to camp upon the 

draughty, gaslit platform.  I sat on my valise, too crushed to 

observe my neighbours; but as they were all cold, and wet, and 

weary, and driven stupidly crazy by the mismanagement to which we 

had been subjected, I believe they can have been no happier than 

myself.  I bought half-a-dozen oranges from a boy, for oranges and 

nuts were the only refection to be had.  As only two of them had 

even a pretence of juice, I threw the other four under the cars, 

and beheld, as in a dream, grown people and children groping on the 

track after my leavings.



At last we were admitted into the cars, utterly dejected, and far 

from dry.  For my own part, I got out a clothes-brush, and brushed 

my trousers as hard as I could till I had dried them and warmed my 

blood into the bargain; but no one else, except my next neighbour 

to whom I lent the brush, appeared to take the least precaution.  

As they were, they composed themselves to sleep.  I had seen the 

lights of Philadelphia, and been twice ordered to change carriages 

and twice countermanded, before I allowed myself to follow their 

example.



TUESDAY. - When I awoke, it was already day; the train was standing 

idle; I was in the last carriage, and, seeing some others strolling 

to and fro about the lines, I opened the door and stepped forth, as 

from a caravan by the wayside.  We were near no station, nor even, 

as far as I could see, within reach of any signal.  A green, open, 

undulating country stretched away upon all sides.  Locust trees and 

a single field of Indian corn gave it a foreign grace and interest; 

but the contours of the land were soft and English.  It was not 

quite England, neither was it quite France; yet like enough either 

to seem natural in my eyes.  And it was in the sky, and not upon 

the earth, that I was surprised to find a change.  Explain it how 

you may, and for my part I cannot explain it at all, the sun rises 

with a different splendour in America and Europe.  There is more 

clear gold and scarlet in our old country mornings; more purple, 

brown, and smoky orange in those of the new.  It may be from habit, 

but to me the coming of day is less fresh and inspiriting in the 

latter; it has a duskier glory, and more nearly resembles sunset; 

it seems to fit some subsequential, evening epoch of the world, as 

though America were in fact, and not merely in fancy, farther from 

the orient of Aurora and the springs of day.  I thought so then, by 

the railroad side in Pennsylvania, and I have thought so a dozen 

times since in far distant parts of the continent.  If it be an 

illusion it is one very deeply rooted, and in which my eyesight is 

accomplice.



Soon after a train whisked by, announcing and accompanying its 

passage by the swift beating of a sort of chapel bell upon the 

engine; and as it was for this we had been waiting, we were 

summoned by the cry of "All aboard!" and went on again upon our 

way.  The whole line, it appeared, was topsy-turvy; an accident at 

midnight having thrown all the traffic hours into arrear.  We paid 

for this in the flesh, for we had no meals all that day.  Fruit we 

could buy upon the cars; and now and then we had a few minutes at 

some station with a meagre show of rolls and sandwiches for sale; 

but we were so many and so ravenous that, though I tried at every 

opportunity, the coffee was always exhausted before I could elbow 

my way to the counter.



Our American sunrise had ushered in a noble summer's day.  There 

was not a cloud; the sunshine was baking; yet in the woody river 

valleys among which we wound our way, the atmosphere preserved a 

sparkling freshness till late in the afternoon.  It had an inland 

sweetness and variety to one newly from the sea; it smelt of woods, 

rivers, and the delved earth.  These, though in so far a country, 

were airs from home.  I stood on the platform by the hour; and as I 

saw, one after another, pleasant villages, carts upon the highway 

and fishers by the stream, and heard cockcrows and cheery voices in 

the distance, and beheld the sun, no longer shining blankly on the 

plains of ocean, but striking among shapely hills and his light 

dispersed and coloured by a thousand accidents of form and surface, 

I began to exult with myself upon this rise in life like a man who 

had come into a rich estate.  And when I had asked the name of a 

river from the brakesman, and heard that it was called the 

Susquehanna, the beauty of the name seemed to be part and parcel of 

the beauty of the land.  As when Adam with divine fitness named the 

creatures, so this word Susquehanna was at once accepted by the 

fancy.  That was the name, as no other could be, for that shining 

river and desirable valley.



None can care for literature in itself who do not take a special 

pleasure in the sound of names; and there is no part of the world 

where nomenclature is so rich, poetical, humorous, and picturesque 

as the United States of America.  All times, races, and languages 

have brought their contribution.  Pekin is in the same State with 

Euclid, with Bellefontaine, and with Sandusky.  Chelsea, with its 

London associations of red brick, Sloane Square, and the King's 

Road, is own suburb to stately and primeval Memphis; there they 

have their seat, translated names of cities, where the Mississippi 

runs by Tennessee and Arkansas; and both, while I was crossing the 

continent, lay, watched by armed men, in the horror and isolation 

of a plague.  Old, red Manhattan lies, like an Indian arrowhead 

under a steam factory, below anglified New York.  The names of the 

States and Territories themselves form a chorus of sweet and most 

romantic vocables:  Delaware, Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Dakota, Iowa, 

Wyoming, Minnesota, and the Carolinas; there are few poems with a 

nobler music for the ear:  a songful, tuneful land; and if the new 

Homer shall arise from the Western continent, his verse will be 

enriched, his pages sing spontaneously, with the names of states 

and cities that would strike the fancy in a business circular.



Late in the evening we were landed in a waiting-room at Pittsburg.  

I had now under my charge a young and sprightly Dutch widow with 

her children; these I was to watch over providentially for a 

certain distance farther on the way; but as I found she was 

furnished with a basket of eatables, I left her in the waiting-room 

to seek a dinner for myself.  I mention this meal, not only because 

it was the first of which I had partaken for about thirty hours, 

but because it was the means of my first introduction to a coloured 

gentleman.  He did me the honour to wait upon me after a fashion, 

while I was eating; and with every word, look, and gesture marched 

me farther into the country of surprise.  He was indeed strikingly 

unlike the negroes of Mrs. Beecher Stowe, or the Christy Minstrels 

of my youth.  Imagine a gentleman, certainly somewhat dark, but of 

a pleasant warm hue, speaking English with a slight and rather odd 

foreign accent, every inch a man of the world, and armed with 

manners so patronisingly superior that I am at a loss to name their 

parallel in England.  A butler perhaps rides as high over the 

unbutlered, but then he sets you right with a reserve and a sort of 

sighing patience which one is often moved to admire.  And again, 

the abstract butler never stoops to familiarity.  But the coloured 

gentleman will pass you a wink at a time; he is familiar like an 

upper form boy to a fag; he unbends to you like Prince Hal with 

Poins and Falstaff.  He makes himself at home and welcome.  Indeed, 

I may say, this waiter behaved himself to me throughout that supper 

much as, with us, a young, free, and not very self-respecting 

master might behave to a good-looking chambermaid.  I had come 

prepared to pity the poor negro, to put him at his ease, to prove 

in a thousand condescensions that I was no sharer in the prejudice 

of race; but I assure you I put my patronage away for another 

occasion, and had the grace to be pleased with that result.



Seeing he was a very honest fellow, I consulted him upon a point of 

etiquette:  if one should offer to tip the American waiter?  

Certainly not, he told me.  Never.  It would not do.  They 

considered themselves too highly to accept.  They would even resent 

the offer.  As for him and me, we had enjoyed a very pleasant 

conversation; he, in particular, had found much pleasure in my 

society; I was a stranger; this was exactly one of those rare 

conjunctures....  Without being very clear seeing, I can still 

perceive the sun at noonday; and the coloured gentleman deftly 

pocketed a quarter.



WEDNESDAY. - A little after midnight I convoyed my widow and 

orphans on board the train; and morning found us far into Ohio.  

This had early been a favourite home of my imagination; I have 

played at being in Ohio by the week, and enjoyed some capital sport 

there with a dummy gun, my person being still unbreeched.  My 

preference was founded on a work which appeared in CASSELL'S FAMILY 

PAPER, and was read aloud to me by my nurse.  It narrated the 

doings of one Custaloga, an Indian brave, who, in the last chapter, 

very obligingly washed the paint off his face and became Sir 

Reginald Somebody-or-other; a trick I never forgave him.  The idea 

of a man being an Indian brave, and then giving that up to be a 

baronet, was one which my mind rejected.  It offended 

verisimilitude, like the pretended anxiety of Robinson Crusoe and 

others to escape from uninhabited islands.



But Ohio was not at all as I had pictured it.  We were now on those 

great plains which stretch unbroken to the Rocky Mountains.  The 

country was flat like Holland, but far from being dull.  All 

through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa, or for as much as I saw 

of them from the train and in my waking moments, it was rich and 

various, and breathed an elegance peculiar to itself.  The tall 

corn pleased the eye; the trees were graceful in themselves, and 

framed the plain into long, aerial vistas; and the clean, bright, 

gardened townships spoke of country fare and pleasant summer 

evenings on the stoop.  It was a sort of flat paradise; but, I am 

afraid, not unfrequented by the devil.  That morning dawned with 

such a freezing chill as I have rarely felt; a chill that was not 

perhaps so measurable by instrument, as it struck home upon the 

heart and seemed to travel with the blood.  Day came in with a 

shudder.  White mists lay thinly over the surface of the plain, as 

we see them more often on a lake; and though the sun had soon 

dispersed and drunk them up, leaving an atmosphere of fever heat 

and crystal pureness from horizon to horizon, the mists had still 

been there, and we knew that this paradise was haunted by killing 

damps and foul malaria.  The fences along the line bore but two 

descriptions of advertisement; one to recommend tobaccos, and the 

other to vaunt remedies against the ague.  At the point of day, and 

while we were all in the grasp of that first chill, a native of the 

state, who had got in at some way station, pronounced it, with a 

doctoral air, "a fever and ague morning."



The Dutch widow was a person of some character.  She had conceived 

at first sight a great aversion for the present writer, which she 

was at no pains to conceal.  But being a woman of a practical 

spirit, she made no difficulty about accepting my attentions, and 

encouraged me to buy her children fruits and candies, to carry all 

her parcels, and even to sleep upon the floor that she might profit 

by my empty seat.  Nay, she was such a rattle by nature, and, so 

powerfully moved to autobiographical talk, that she was forced, for 

want of a better, to take me into confidence and tell me the story 

of her life.  I heard about her late husband, who seemed to have 

made his chief impression by taking her out pleasuring on Sundays.  

I could tell you her prospects, her hopes, the amount of her 

fortune, the cost of her housekeeping by the week, and a variety of 

particular matters that are not usually disclosed except to 

friends.  At one station, she shook up her children to look at a 

man on the platform and say if he were not like Mr. Z.; while to me 

she explained how she had been keeping company with this Mr. Z., 

how far matters had proceeded, and how it was because of his 

desistance that she was now travelling to the West.  Then, when I 

was thus put in possession of the facts, she asked my judgment on 

that type of manly beauty.  I admired it to her heart's content.  

She was not, I think, remarkably veracious in talk, but broidered 

as fancy prompted, and built castles in the air out of her past; 

yet she had that sort of candour, to keep me, in spite of all these 

confidences, steadily aware of her aversion.  Her parting words 

were ingeniously honest.  "I am sure," said she, "we all OUGHT to 

be very much obliged to you."  I cannot pretend that she put me at 

my ease; but I had a certain respect for such a genuine dislike.  A 

poor nature would have slipped, in the course of these 

familiarities, into a sort of worthless toleration for me.



We reached Chicago in the evening.  I was turned out of the cars, 

bundled into an omnibus, and driven off through the streets to the 

station of a different railroad.  Chicago seemed a great and gloomy 

city.  I remember having subscribed, let us say sixpence, towards 

its restoration at the period of the fire; and now when I beheld 

street after street of ponderous houses and crowds of comfortable 

burghers, I thought it would be a graceful act for the corporation 

to refund that sixpence, or, at the least, to entertain me to a 

cheerful dinner.  But there was no word of restitution.  I was that 

city's benefactor, yet I was received in a third-class waiting-

room, and the best dinner I could get was a dish of ham and eggs at 

my own expense.



I can safely say, I have never been so dog-tired as that night in 

Chicago.  When it was time to start, I descended the platform like 

a man in a dream.  It was a long train, lighted from end to end; 

and car after car, as I came up with it, was not only filled but 

overflowing.  My valise, my knapsack, my rug, with those six 

ponderous tomes of Bancroft, weighed me double; I was hot, 

feverish, painfully athirst; and there was a great darkness over 

me, an internal darkness, not to be dispelled by gas.  When at last 

I found an empty bench, I sank into it like a bundle of rags, the 

world seemed to swim away into the distance, and my consciousness 

dwindled within me to a mere pin's head, like a taper on a foggy 

night.



When I came a little more to myself, I found that there had sat 

down beside me a very cheerful, rosy little German gentleman, 

somewhat gone in drink, who was talking away to me, nineteen to the 

dozen, as they say.  I did my best to keep up the conversation; for 

it seemed to me dimly as if something depended upon that.  I heard 

him relate, among many other things, that there were pickpockets on 

the train, who had already robbed a man of forty dollars and a 

return ticket; but though I caught the words, I do not think I 

properly understood the sense until next morning; and I believe I 

replied at the time that I was very glad to hear it.  What else he 

talked about I have no guess; I remember a gabbling sound of words, 

his profuse gesticulation, and his smile, which was highly 

explanatory:  but no more.  And I suppose I must have shown my 

confusion very plainly; for, first, I saw him knit his brows at me 

like one who has conceived a doubt; next, he tried me in German, 

supposing perhaps that I was unfamiliar with the English tongue; 

and finally, in despair, he rose and left me.  I felt chagrined; 

but my fatigue was too crushing for delay, and, stretching myself 

as far as that was possible upon the bench, I was received at once 

into a dreamless stupor.



The little German gentleman was only going a little way into the 

suburbs after a DINER FIN, and was bent on entertainment while the 

journey lasted.  Having failed with me, he pitched next upon 

another emigrant, who had come through from Canada, and was not one 

jot less weary than myself.  Nay, even in a natural state, as I 

found next morning when we scraped acquaintance, he was a heavy, 

uncommunicative man.  After trying him on different topics, it 

appears that the little German gentleman flounced into a temper, 

swore an oath or two, and departed from that car in quest of 

livelier society.  Poor little gentleman!  I suppose he thought an 

emigrant should be a rollicking, free-hearted blade, with a flask 

of foreign brandy and a long, comical story to beguile the moments 

of digestion.



THURSDAY. - I suppose there must be a cycle in the fatigue of 

travelling, for when I awoke next morning, I was entirely renewed 

in spirits and ate a hearty breakfast of porridge, with sweet milk, 

and coffee and hot cakes, at Burlington upon the Mississippi.  

Another long day's ride followed, with but one feature worthy of 

remark.  At a place called Creston, a drunken man got in.  He was 

aggressively friendly, but, according to English notions, not at 

all unpresentable upon a train.  For one stage he eluded the notice 

of the officials; but just as we were beginning to move out of the 

next station, Cromwell by name, by came the conductor.  There was a 

word or two of talk; and then the official had the man by the 

shoulders, twitched him from his seat, marched him through the car, 

and sent him flying on to the track.  It was done in three motions, 

as exact as a piece of drill.  The train was still moving slowly, 

although beginning to mend her pace, and the drunkard got his feet 

without a fall.  He carried a red bundle, though not so red as his 

cheeks; and he shook this menacingly in the air with one hand, 

while the other stole behind him to the region of the kidneys.  It 

was the first indication that I had come among revolvers, and I 

observed it with some emotion.  The conductor stood on the steps 

with one hand on his hip, looking back at him; and perhaps this 

attitude imposed upon the creature, for he turned without further 

ado, and went off staggering along the track towards Cromwell 

followed by a peal of laughter from the cars.  They were speaking 

English all about me, but I knew I was in a foreign land.



Twenty minutes before nine that night, we were deposited at the 

Pacific Transfer Station near Council Bluffs, on the eastern bank 

of the Missouri river.  Here we were to stay the night at a kind of 

caravanserai, set apart for emigrants.  But I gave way to a thirst 

for luxury, separated myself from my companions, and marched with 

my effects into the Union Pacific Hotel.  A white clerk and a 

coloured gentleman whom, in my plain European way, I should call 

the boots, were installed behind a counter like bank tellers.  They 

took my name, assigned me a number, and proceeded to deal with my 

packages.  And here came the tug of war.  I wished to give up my 

packages into safe keeping; but I did not wish to go to bed.  And 

this, it appeared, was impossible in an American hotel.



It was, of course, some inane misunderstanding, and sprang from my 

unfamiliarity with the language.  For although two nations use the 

same words and read the same books, intercourse is not conducted by 

the dictionary.  The business of life is not carried on by words, 

but in set phrases, each with a special and almost a slang 

signification.  Some international obscurity prevailed between me 

and the coloured gentleman at Council Bluffs; so that what I was 

asking, which seemed very natural to me, appeared to him a 

monstrous exigency.  He refused, and that with the plainness of the 

West.  This American manner of conducting matters of business is, 

at first, highly unpalatable to the European.  When we approach a 

man in the way of his calling, and for those services by which he 

earns his bread, we consider him for the time being our hired 

servant.  But in the American opinion, two gentlemen meet and have 

a friendly talk with a view to exchanging favours if they shall 

agree to please.  I know not which is the more convenient, nor even 

which is the more truly courteous.  The English stiffness 

unfortunately tends to be continued after the particular 

transaction is at an end, and thus favours class separations.  But 

on the other hand, these equalitarian plainnesses leave an open 

field for the insolence of Jack-in-office.



I was nettled by the coloured gentleman's refusal, and unbuttoned 

my wrath under the similitude of ironical submission.  I knew 

nothing, I said, of the ways of American hotels; but I had no 

desire to give trouble.  If there was nothing for it but to get to 

bed immediately, let him say the word, and though it was not my 

habit, I should cheerfully obey.



He burst into a shout of laughter.  "Ah!" said he, "you do not know 

about America.  They are fine people in America.  Oh! you will like 

them very well.  But you mustn't get mad.  I know what you want.  

You come along with me."



And issuing from behind the counter, and taking me by the arm like 

an old acquaintance, he led me to the bar of the hotel.



"There," said he, pushing me from him by the shoulder, "go and have 

a drink!"





THE EMIGRANT TRAIN





All this while I had been travelling by mixed trains, where I might 

meet with Dutch widows and little German gentry fresh from table.  

I had been but a latent emigrant; now I was to be branded once 

more, and put apart with my fellows.  It was about two in the 

afternoon of Friday that I found myself in front of the Emigrant 

House, with more than a hundred others, to be sorted and boxed for 

the journey.  A white-haired official, with a stick under one arm, 

and a list in the other hand, stood apart in front of us, and 

called name after name in the tone of a command.  At each name you 

would see a family gather up its brats and bundles and run for the 

hindmost of the three cars that stood awaiting us, and I soon 

concluded that this was to be set apart for the women and children.  

The second or central car, it turned out, was devoted to men 

travelling alone, and the third to the Chinese.  The official was 

easily moved to anger at the least delay; but the emigrants were 

both quick at answering their names, and speedy in getting 

themselves and their effects on board.



The families once housed, we men carried the second car without 

ceremony by simultaneous assault.  I suppose the reader has some 

notion of an American railroad-car, that long, narrow wooden box, 

like a flat-roofed Noah's ark, with a stove and a convenience, one 

at either end, a passage down the middle, and transverse benches 

upon either hand.  Those destined for emigrants on the Union 

Pacific are only remarkable for their extreme plainness, nothing 

but wood entering in any part into their constitution, and for the 

usual inefficacy of the lamps, which often went out and shed but a 

dying glimmer even while they burned.  The benches are too short 

for anything but a young child.  Where there is scarce elbow-room 

for two to sit, there will not be space enough for one to lie.  

Hence the company, or rather, as it appears from certain bills 

about the Transfer Station, the company's servants, have conceived 

a plan for the better accommodation of travellers.  They prevail on 

every two to chum together.  To each of the chums they sell a board 

and three square cushions stuffed with straw, and covered with thin 

cotton.  The benches can be made to face each other in pairs, for 

the backs are reversible.  On the approach of night the boards are 

laid from bench to bench, making a couch wide enough for two, and 

long enough for a man of the middle height; and the chums lie down 

side by side upon the cushions with the head to the conductor's van 

and the feet to the engine.  When the train is full, of course this 

plan is impossible, for there must not be more than one to every 

bench, neither can it be carried out unless the chums agree.  It 

was to bring about this last condition that our white-haired 

official now bestirred himself.  He made a most active master of 

ceremonies, introducing likely couples, and even guaranteeing the 

amiability and honesty of each.  The greater the number of happy 

couples the better for his pocket, for it was he who sold the raw 

material of the beds.  His price for one board and three straw 

cushions began with two dollars and a half; but before the train 

left, and, I am sorry to say, long after I had purchased mine, it 

had fallen to one dollar and a half.



The match-maker had a difficulty with me; perhaps, like some 

ladies, I showed myself too eager for union at any price; but 

certainly the first who was picked out to be my bedfellow, declined 

the honour without thanks.  He was an old, heavy, slow-spoken man, 

I think from Yankeeland, looked me all over with great timidity, 

and then began to excuse himself in broken phrases.  He didn't know 

the young man, he said.  The young man might be very honest, but 

how was he to know that?  There was another young man whom he had 

met already in the train; he guessed he was honest, and would 

prefer to chum with him upon the whole.  All this without any sort 

of excuse, as though I had been inanimate or absent.  I began to 

tremble lest every one should refuse my company, and I be left 

rejected.  But the next in turn was a tall, strapping, long-limbed, 

small-headed, curly-haired Pennsylvania Dutchman, with a soldierly 

smartness in his manner.  To be exact, he had acquired it in the 

navy.  But that was all one; he had at least been trained to 

desperate resolves, so he accepted the match, and the white-haired 

swindler pronounced the connubial benediction, and pocketed his 

fees.



The rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train.  I am 

afraid to say how many baggage-waggons followed the engine, 

certainly a score; then came the Chinese, then we, then the 

families, and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what, if 

I have it rightly, is called his caboose.  The class to which I 

belonged was of course far the largest, and we ran over, so to 

speak, to both sides; so that there were some Caucasians among the 

Chinamen, and some bachelors among the families.  But our own car 

was pure from admixture, save for one little boy of eight or nine 

who had the whooping-cough.  At last, about six, the long train 

crawled out of the Transfer Station and across the wide Missouri 

river to Omaha, westward bound.



It was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars.  There was 

thunder in the air, which helped to keep us restless.  A man played 

many airs upon the cornet, and none of them were much attended to, 

until he came to "Home, sweet home."  It was truly strange to note 

how the talk ceased at that, and the faces began to lengthen.  I 

have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or 

bad; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best 

described as a brutal assault upon the feelings.  Pathos must be 

relieved by dignity of treatment.  If you wallow naked in the 

pathetic, like the author of "Home, sweet home," you make your 

hearers weep in an unmanly fashion; and even while yet they are 

moved, they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their 

weakness.  It did not come to tears that night, for the experiment 

was interrupted.  An elderly, hard-looking man, with a goatee beard 

and about as much appearance of sentiment an you would expect from 

a retired slaver, turned with a start and bade the performer stop 

that "damned thing."  "I've heard about enough of that," he added; 

"give us something about the good country we're going to."  A 

murmur of adhesion ran round the car; the performer took the 

instrument from his lips, laughed and nodded, and then struck into 

a dancing measure; and, like a new Timotheus, stilled immediately 

the emotion he had raised.



The day faded; the lamps were lit; a party of wild young men, who 

got off next evening at North Platte, stood together on the stern 

platform, singing "The Sweet By-and-bye" with very tuneful voices; 

the chums began to put up their beds; and it seemed as if the 

business of the day were at an end.  But it was not so; for, the 

train stopping at some station, the cars were instantly thronged 

with the natives, wives and fathers, young men and maidens, some of 

them in little more than nightgear, some with stable lanterns, and 

all offering beds for sale.  Their charge began with twenty-five 

cents a cushion, but fell, before the train went on again, to 

fifteen, with the bed-board gratis, or less than one-fifth of what 

I had paid for mine at the Transfer.  This is my contribution to 

the economy of future emigrants.



A great personage on an American train is the newsboy.  He sells 

books (such books!), papers, fruit, lollipops, and cigars; and on 

emigrant journeys, soap, towels, tin washing dishes, tin coffee 

pitchers, coffee, tea, sugar, and tinned eatables, mostly hash or 

beans and bacon.  Early next morning the newsboy went around the 

cars, and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of 

the hour.  It requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds; but 

washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a 

syndicate of three.  I myself entered a little after sunrise into 

articles of agreement, and became one of the firm of Pennsylvania, 

Shakespeare, and Dubuque.  Shakespeare was my own nickname on the 

cars; Pennsylvania that of my bedfellow; and Dubuque, the name of a 

place in the State of Iowa, that of an amiable young fellow going 

west to cure an asthma, and retarding his recovery by incessantly 

chewing or smoking, and sometimes chewing and smoking together.  I 

have never seen tobacco so sillily abused.  Shakespeare bought a 

tin washing-dish, Dubuque a towel, and Pennsylvania a brick of 

soap.  The partners used these instruments, one after another, 

according to the order of their first awaking; and when the firm 

had finished there was no want of borrowers.  Each filled the tin 

dish at the water filter opposite the stove, and retired with the 

whole stock in trade to the platform of the car.  There he knelt 

down, supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one 

elbow crooked about the railing, and made a shift to wash his face 

and neck and hands; a cold, an insufficient, and, if the train is 

moving rapidly, a somewhat dangerous toilet.



On a similar division of expense, the firm of Pennsylvania, 

Shakespeare, and Dubuque supplied themselves with coffee, sugar, 

and necessary vessels; and their operations are a type of what went 

on through all the cars.  Before the sun was up the stove would be 

brightly burning; at the first station the natives would come on 

board with milk and eggs and coffee cakes; and soon from end to end 

the car would be filled with little parties breakfasting upon the 

bed-boards.  It was the pleasantest hour of the day.



There were meals to be had, however, by the wayside:  a breakfast 

in the morning, a dinner somewhere between eleven and two, and 

supper from five to eight or nine at night.  We had rarely less 

than twenty minutes for each; and if we had not spent many another 

twenty minutes waiting for some express upon a side track among 

miles of desert, we might have taken an hour to each repast and 

arrived at San Francisco up to time.  For haste is not the foible 

of an emigrant train.  It gets through on sufferance, running the 

gauntlet among its more considerable brethren; should there be a 

block, it is unhesitatingly sacrificed; and they cannot, in 

consequence, predict the length of the passage within a day or so.  

Civility is the main comfort that you miss.  Equality, though 

conceived very largely in America, does not extend so low down as 

to an emigrant.  Thus in all other trains, a warning cry of  "All 

aboard!" recalls the passengers to take their seats; but as soon as 

I was alone with emigrants, and from the Transfer all the way to 

San Francisco, I found this ceremony was pretermitted; the train 

stole from the station without note of warning, and you had to keep 

an eye upon it even while you ate.  The annoyance is considerable, 

and the disrespect both wanton and petty.



Many conductors, again, will hold no communication with an 

emigrant.  I asked a conductor one day at what time the train would 

stop for dinner; as he made no answer I repeated the question, with 

a like result; a third time I returned to the charge, and then 

Jack-in-office looked me coolly in the face for several seconds and 

turned ostentatiously away.  I believe he was half ashamed of his 

brutality; for when another person made the same inquiry, although 

he still refused the information, he condescended to answer, and 

even to justify his reticence in a voice loud enough for me to 

hear.  It was, he said, his principle not to tell people where they 

were to dine; for one answer led to many other questions, as what 

o'clock it was? or, how soon should we be there? and he could not 

afford to be eternally worried.



As you are thus cut off from the superior authorities, a great deal 

of your comfort depends on the character of the newsboy.  He has it 

in his power indefinitely to better and brighten the emigrant's 

lot.  The newsboy with whom we started from the Transfer was a 

dark, bullying, contemptuous, insolent scoundrel, who treated us 

like dogs.  Indeed, in his case, matters came nearly to a fight.  

It happened thus:  he was going his rounds through the cars with 

some commodities for sale, and coming to a party who were at SEVEN-

UP or CASCINO (our two games), upon a bed-board, slung down a 

cigar-box in the middle of the cards, knocking one man's hand to 

the floor.  It was the last straw.  In a moment the whole party 

were upon their feet, the cigars were upset, and he was ordered to 

"get out of that directly, or he would get more than he reckoned 

for." The fellow grumbled and muttered, but ended by making off, 

and was less openly insulting in the future.  On the other hand, 

the lad who rode with us in this capacity from Ogden to Sacramento 

made himself the friend of all, and helped us with information, 

attention, assistance, and a kind countenance.  He told us where 

and when we should have our meals, and how long the train would 

stop; kept seats at table for those who were delayed, and watched 

that we should neither be left behind nor yet unnecessarily 

hurried.  You, who live at home at ease, can hardly realise the 

greatness of this service, even had it stood alone.  When I think 

of that lad coming and going, train after train, with his bright 

face and civil words, I see how easily a good man may become the 

benefactor of his kind.  Perhaps he is discontented with himself, 

perhaps troubled with ambitions; why, if he but knew it, he is a 

hero of the old Greek stamp; and while he thinks he is only earning 

a profit of a few cents, and that perhaps exorbitant, he is doing a 

man's work, and bettering the world.



I must tell here an experience of mine with another newsboy.  I 

tell it because it gives so good an example of that uncivil 

kindness of the American, which is perhaps their most bewildering 

character to one newly landed.  It was immediately after I had left 

the emigrant train; and I am told I looked like a man at death's 

door, so much had this long journey shaken me.  I sat at the end of 

a car, and the catch being broken, and myself feverish and sick, I 

had to hold the door open with my foot for the sake of air.  In 

this attitude my leg debarred the newsboy from his box of 

merchandise.  I made haste to let him pass when I observed that he 

was coming; but I was busy with a book, and so once or twice he 

came upon me unawares.  On these occasions he most rudely struck my 

foot aside; and though I myself apologised, as if to show him the 

way, he answered me never a word.  I chafed furiously, and I fear 

the next time it would have come to words.  But suddenly I felt a 

touch upon my shoulder, and a large juicy pear was put into my 

hand.  It was the newsboy, who had observed that I was looking ill, 

and so made me this present out of a tender heart.  For the rest of 

the journey I was petted like a sick child; he lent me newspapers, 

thus depriving himself of his legitimate profit on their sale, and 

came repeatedly to sit by me and cheer me up.





THE PLAINS OF NEBRASKA





It had thundered on the Friday night, but the sun rose on Saturday 

without a cloud.  We were at sea - there is no other adequate 

expression - on the plains of Nebraska.  I made my observatory on 

the top of a fruit-waggon, and sat by the hour upon that perch to 

spy about me, and to spy in vain for something new.  It was a world 

almost without a feature; an empty sky, an empty earth; front and 

back, the line of railway stretched from horizon to horizon, like a 

cue across a billiard-board; on either hand, the green plain ran 

till it touched the skirts of heaven.  Along the track innumerable 

wild sunflowers, no bigger than a crown-piece, bloomed in a 

continuous flower-bed; grazing beasts were seen upon the prairie at 

all degrees of distance and diminution; and now and again we might 

perceive a few dots beside the railroad which grew more and more 

distinct as we drew nearer till they turned into wooden cabins, and 

then dwindled and dwindled in our wake until they melted into their 

surroundings, and we were once more alone upon the billiard-board.  

The train toiled over this infinity like a snail; and being the one 

thing moving, it was wonderful what huge proportions it began to 

assume in our regard.  It seemed miles in length, and either end of 

it within but a step of the horizon.  Even my own body or my own 

head seemed a great thing in that emptiness.  I note the feeling 

the more readily as it is the contrary of what I have read of in 

the experience of others.  Day and night, above the roar of the 

train, our ears were kept busy with the incessant chirp of 

grasshoppers - a noise like the winding up of countless clocks and 

watches, which began after a while to seem proper to that land.



To one hurrying through by steam there was a certain exhilaration 

in this spacious vacancy, this greatness of the air, this discovery 

of the whole arch of heaven, this straight, unbroken, prison-line 

of the horizon.  Yet one could not but reflect upon the weariness 

of those who passed by there in old days, at the foot's pace of 

oxen, painfully urging their teams, and with no landmark but that 

unattainable evening sun for which they steered, and which daily 

fled them by an equal stride.  They had nothing, it would seem, to 

overtake; nothing by which to reckon their advance; no sight for 

repose or for encouragement; but stage after stage, only the dead 

green waste under foot, and the mocking, fugitive horizon.  But the 

eye, as I have been told, found differences even here; and at the 

worst the emigrant came, by perseverance, to the end of his toil.  

It is the settlers, after all, at whom we have a right to marvel.  

Our consciousness, by which we live, is itself but the creature of 

variety.  Upon what food does it subsist in such a land?  What 

livelihood can repay a human creature for a life spent in this huge 

sameness?  He is cut off from books, from news, from company, from 

all that can relieve existence but the prosecution of his affairs.  

A sky full of stars is the most varied spectacle that he can hope.  

He may walk five miles and see nothing; ten, and it is as though he 

had not moved; twenty, and still he is in the midst of the same 

great level, and has approached no nearer to the one object within 

view, the flat horizon which keeps pace with his advance.  We are 

full at home of the question of agreeable wall-papers, and wise 

people are of opinion that the temper may be quieted by sedative 

surroundings.  But what is to be said of the Nebraskan settler?  

His is a wall-paper with a vengeance - one quarter of the universe 

laid bare in all its gauntness.



His eye must embrace at every glance the whole seeming concave of 

the visible world; it quails before so vast an outlook, it is 

tortured by distance; yet there is no rest or shelter till the man 

runs into his cabin, and can repose his sight upon things near at 

hand.  Hence, I am told, a sickness of the vision peculiar to these 

empty plains.



Yet perhaps with sunflowers and cicadae, summer and winter, cattle, 

wife and family, the settler may create a full and various 

existence.  One person at least I saw upon the plains who seemed in 

every way superior to her lot.  This was a woman who boarded us at 

a way station, selling milk.  She was largely formed; her features 

were more than comely; she had that great rarity - a fine 

complexion which became her; and her eyes were kind, dark, and 

steady.  She sold milk with patriarchal grace.  There was not a 

line in her countenance, not a note in her soft and sleepy voice, 

but spoke of an entire contentment with her life.  It would have 

been fatuous arrogance to pity such a woman.  Yet the place where 

she lived was to me almost ghastly.  Less than a dozen wooden 

houses, all of a shape and all nearly of a size, stood planted 

along the railway lines.  Each stood apart in its own lot.  Each 

opened direct off the billiard-board, as if it were a billiard-

board indeed, and these only models that had been set down upon it 

ready made.  Her own, into which I looked, was clean but very 

empty, and showed nothing homelike but the burning fire.  This 

extreme newness, above all in so naked and flat a country, gives a 

strong impression of artificiality.  With none of the litter and 

discoloration of human life; with the paths unworn, and the houses 

still sweating from the axe, such a settlement as this seems purely 

scenic.  The mind is loth to accept it for a piece of reality; and 

it seems incredible that life can go on with so few properties, or 

the great child, man, find entertainment in so bare a playroom.



And truly it is as yet an incomplete society in some points; or at 

least it contained, as I passed through, one person incompletely 

civilised.  At North Platte, where we supped that evening, one man 

asked another to pass the milk-jug.  This other was well-dressed 

and of what we should call a respectable appearance; a darkish man, 

high spoken, eating as though he had some usage of society; but he 

turned upon the first speaker with extraordinary vehemence of tone 

-



"There's a waiter here!" he cried.



"I only asked you to pass the milk," explained the first.



Here is the retort verbatim -



"Pass!  Hell!  I'm not paid for that business; the waiter's paid 

for it.  You should use civility at table, and, by God, I'll show 

you how!"



The other man very wisely made no answer, and the bully went on 

with his supper as though nothing had occurred.  It pleases me to 

think that some day soon he will meet with one of his own kidney; 

and that perhaps both may fall.





THE DESERT OF WYOMING





To cross such a plain is to grow homesick for the mountains.  I 

longed for the Black Hills of Wyoming, which I knew we were soon to 

enter, like an ice-bound whaler for the spring.  Alas! and it was a 

worse country than the other.  All Sunday and Monday we travelled 

through these sad mountains, or over the main ridge of the Rockies, 

which is a fair match to them for misery of aspect.  Hour after 

hour it was the same unhomely and unkindly world about our onward 

path; tumbled boulders, cliffs that drearily imitate the shape of 

monuments and fortifications - how drearily, how tamely, none can 

tell who has not seen them; not a tree, not a patch of sward, not 

one shapely or commanding mountain form; sage-brush, eternal sage-

brush; over all, the same weariful and gloomy colouring, grays 

warming into brown, grays darkening towards black; and for sole 

sign of life, here and there a few fleeing antelopes; here and 

there, but at incredible intervals, a creek running in a canon.  

The plains have a grandeur of their own; but here there is nothing 

but a contorted smallness.  Except for the air, which was light and 

stimulating, there was not one good circumstance in that God-

forsaken land.



I had been suffering in my health a good deal all the way; and at 

last, whether I was exhausted by my complaint or poisoned in some 

wayside eating-house, the evening we left Laramie, I fell sick 

outright.  That was a night which I shall not readily forget.  The 

lamps did not go out; each made a faint shining in its own 

neighbourhood, and the shadows were confounded together in the 

long, hollow box of the car.  The sleepers lay in uneasy attitudes; 

here two chums alongside, flat upon their backs like dead folk; 

there a man sprawling on the floor, with his face upon his arm; 

there another half seated with his head and shoulders on the bench.  

The most passive were continually and roughly shaken by the 

movement of the train; others stirred, turned, or stretched out 

their arms like children; it was surprising how many groaned and 

murmured in their sleep; and as I passed to and fro, stepping 

across the prostrate, and caught now a snore, now a gasp, now a 

half-formed word, it gave me a measure of the worthlessness of rest 

in that unresting vehicle.  Although it was chill, I was obliged to 

open my window, for the degradation of the air soon became 

intolerable to one who was awake and using the full supply of life.  

Outside, in a glimmering night, I saw the black, amorphous hills 

shoot by unweariedly into our wake.  They that long for morning 

have never longed for it more earnestly than I.



And yet when day came, it was to shine upon the same broken and 

unsightly quarter of the world.  Mile upon mile, and not a tree, a 

bird, or a river.  Only down the long, sterile canons, the train 

shot hooting and awoke the resting echo.  That train was the one 

piece of life in all the deadly land; it was the one actor, the one 

spectacle fit to be observed in this paralysis of man and nature.  

And when I think how the railroad has been pushed through this 

unwatered wilderness and haunt of savage tribes, and now will bear 

an emigrant for some 12 pounds from the Atlantic to the Golden 

Gates; how at each stage of the construction, roaring, impromptu 

cities, full of gold and lust and death, sprang up and then died 

away again, and are now but wayside stations in the desert; how in 

these uncouth places pig-tailed Chinese pirates worked side by side 

with border ruffians and broken men from Europe, talking together 

in a mixed dialect, mostly oaths, gambling, drinking, quarrelling 

and murdering like wolves; how the plumed hereditary lord of all 

America heard, in this last fastness, the scream of the "bad 

medicine waggon" charioting his foes; and then when I go on to 

remember that all this epical turmoil was conducted by gentlemen in 

frock coats, and with a view to nothing more extraordinary than a 

fortune and a subsequent visit to Paris, it seems to me, I own, as 

if this railway were the one typical achievement of the age in 

which we live, as if it brought together into one plot all the ends 

of the world and all the degrees of social rank, and offered to 

some great writer the busiest, the most extended, and the most 

varied subject for an enduring literary work.  If it be romance, if 

it be contrast, if it be heroism that we require, what was Troy 

town to this?  But, alas! it is not these things that are necessary 

- it is only Homer.



Here also we are grateful to the train, as to some god who conducts 

us swiftly through these shades and by so many hidden perils.  

Thirst, hunger, the sleight and ferocity of Indians are all no more 

feared, so lightly do we skim these horrible lands; as the gull, 

who wings safely through the hurricane and past the shark.  Yet we 

should not be forgetful of these hardships of the past; and to keep 

the balance true, since I have complained of the trifling 

discomforts of my journey, perhaps more than was enough, let me add 

an original document.  It was not written by Homer, but by a boy of 

eleven, long since dead, and is dated only twenty years ago.  I 

shall punctuate, to make things clearer, but not change the 

spelling.



"My dear Sister Mary, - I am afraid you will go nearly crazy when 

you read my letter.  If Jerry" (the writer's eldest brother) "has 

not written to you before now, you will be surprised to heare that 

we are in California, and that poor Thomas" (another brother, of 

fifteen) "is dead.  We started from - in July, with plenly of 

provisions and too yoke oxen.  We went along very well till we got 

within six or seven hundred miles of California, when the Indians 

attacked us.  We found places where they had killed the emigrants.  

We had one passenger with us, too guns, and one revolver; so we ran 

all the lead We had into bullets (and) hung the guns up in the 

wagon so that we could get at them in a minit.  It was about two 

o'clock in the afternoon; droave the cattel a little way; when a 

prairie chicken alited a little way from the wagon.



"Jerry took out one of the guns to shoot it, and told Tom drive the 

oxen.  Tom and I drove the oxen, and Jerry and the passenger went 

on.  Then, after a little, I left Tom and caught up with Jerry and 

the other man.  Jerry stopped Tom to come up; me and the man went 

on and sit down by a little stream.  In a few minutes, we heard 

some noise; then three shots (they all struck poor Tom, I suppose); 

then they gave the war hoop, and as many as twenty of the redskins 

came down upon us.  The three that shot Tom was hid by the side of 

the road in the bushes.



"I thought the Tom and Jerry were shot; so I told the other man 

that Tom and Jerry were dead, and that we had better try to escape, 

if possible.  I had no shoes on; having a sore foot, I thought I 

would not put them on.  The man and me run down the road, but We 

was soon stopped by an Indian on a pony.  We then turend the other 

way, and run up the side of the Mountain, and hid behind some cedar 

trees, and stayed there till dark.  The Indians hunted all over 

after us, and verry close to us, so close that we could here there 

tomyhawks Jingle.  At dark the man and me started on, I stubing my 

toes against sticks and stones.  We traveld on all night; and next 

morning, just as it was getting gray, we saw something in the shape 

of a man.  It layed Down in the grass.  We went up to it, and it 

was Jerry.  He thought we ware Indians.  You can imagine how glad 

he was to see me.  He thought we was all dead but him, and we 

thought him and Tom was dead.  He had the gun that he took out of 

the wagon to shoot the prairie Chicken; all he had was the load 

that was in it.



"We traveld on till about eight o'clock, We caught up with one 

wagon with too men with it.  We had traveld with them before one 

day; we stopt and they Drove on; we knew that they was ahead of us, 

unless they had been killed to.  My feet was so sore when we caught 

up with them that I had to ride; I could not step.  We traveld on 

for too days, when the men that owned the cattle said they would 

(could) not drive them another inch.  We unyoked the oxen; we had 

about seventy pounds of flour; we took it out and divided it into 

four packs.  Each of the men took about 18 pounds apiece and a 

blanket.  I carried a little bacon, dried meat, and little quilt; I 

had in all about twelve pounds.  We had one pint of flour a day for 

our alloyance.  Sometimes we made soup of it; sometimes we (made) 

pancakes; and sometimes mixed it up with cold water and eat it that 

way.  We traveld twelve or fourteen days.  The time came at last 

when we should have to reach some place or starve.  We saw fresh 

horse and cattle tracks.  The morning come, we scraped all the 

flour out of the sack, mixed it up, and baked it into bread, and 

made some soup, and eat everything we had.  We traveld on all day 

without anything to eat, and that evening we Caught up with a sheep 

train of eight wagons.  We traveld with them till we arrived at the 

settlements; and know I am safe in California, and got to good 

home, and going to school.



"Jerry is working in - .  It is a good country.  You can get from 

50 to 60 and 75 Dollars for cooking.  Tell me all about the affairs 

in the States, and how all the folks get along."



And so ends this artless narrative.  The little man was at school 

again, God bless him, while his brother lay scalped upon the 

deserts.





FELLOW-PASSENGERS





At Ogden we changed cars from the Union Pacific to the Central 

Pacific line of railroad.  The change was doubly welcome; for, 

first, we had better cars on the new line; and, second, those in 

which we had been cooped for more than ninety hours had begun to 

stink abominably.  Several yards away, as we returned, let us say 

from dinner, our nostrils were assailed by rancid air.  I have 

stood on a platform while the whole train was shunting; and as the 

dwelling-cars drew near, there would come a whiff of pure 

menagerie, only a little sourer, as from men instead of monkeys.  I 

think we are human only in virtue of open windows.  Without fresh 

air, you only require a bad heart, and a remarkable command of the 

Queen's English, to become such another as Dean Swift; a kind of 

leering, human goat, leaping and wagging your scut on mountains of 

offence.  I do my best to keep my head the other way, and look for 

the human rather than the bestial in this Yahoo-like business of 

the emigrant train.  But one thing I must say, the car of the 

Chinese was notably the least offensive.



The cars on the Central Pacific were nearly twice as high, and so 

proportionally airier; they were freshly varnished, which gave us 

all a sense of cleanliness an though we had bathed; the seats drew 

out and joined in the centre, so that there was no more need for 

bed boards; and there was an upper tier of berths which could be 

closed by day and opened at night.



I had by this time some opportunity of seeing the people whom I was 

among.  They were in rather marked contrast to the emigrants I had 

met on board ship while crossing the Atlantic.  They were mostly 

lumpish fellows, silent and noisy, a common combination; somewhat 

sad, I should say, with an extraordinary poor taste in humour, and 

little interest in their fellow-creatures beyond that of a cheap 

and merely external curiosity.  If they heard a man's name and 

business, they seemed to think they had the heart of that mystery; 

but they were as eager to know that much as they were indifferent 

to the rest.  Some of them were on nettles till they learned your 

name was Dickson and you a journeyman baker; but beyond that, 

whether you were Catholic or Mormon, dull or clever, fierce or 

friendly, was all one to them.  Others who were not so stupid, 

gossiped a little, and, I am bound to say, unkindly.  A favourite 

witticism was for some lout to raise the alarm of  "All aboard!" 

while the rest of us were dining, thus contributing his mite to the 

general discomfort.  Such a one was always much applauded for his 

high spirits.  When I was ill coming through Wyoming, I was 

astonished - fresh from the eager humanity on board ship - to meet 

with little but laughter.  One of the young men even amused himself 

by incommoding me, as was then very easy; and that not from ill-

nature, but mere clodlike incapacity to think, for he expected me 

to join the laugh.  I did so, but it was phantom merriment.  Later 

on, a man from Kansas had three violent epileptic fits, and though, 

of course, there were not wanting some to help him, it was rather 

superstitious terror than sympathy that his case evoked among his 

fellow-passengers.  "Oh, I hope he's not going to die!" cried a 

woman; "it would be terrible to have a dead body!"  And there was a 

very general movement to leave the man behind at the next station.  

This, by good fortune, the conductor negatived.



There was a good deal of story-telling in some quarters; in others, 

little but silence.  In this society, more than any other that ever 

I was in, it was the narrator alone who seemed to enjoy the 

narrative.  It was rarely that any one listened for the listening.  

If he lent an ear to another man's story, it was because he was in 

immediate want of a hearer for one of his own.  Food and the 

progress of the train were the subjects most generally treated; 

many joined to discuss these who otherwise would hold their 

tongues.  One small knot had no better occupation than to worm out 

of me my name; and the more they tried, the more obstinately fixed 

I grew to baffle them.  They assailed me with artful questions and 

insidious offers of correspondence in the future; but I was 

perpetually on my guard, and parried their assaults with inward 

laughter.  I am sure Dubuque would have given me ten dollars for 

the secret.  He owed me far more, had he understood life, for thus 

preserving him a lively interest throughout the journey.  I met one 

of my fellow-passengers months after, driving a street tramway car 

in San Francisco; and, as the joke was now out of season, told him 

my name without subterfuge.  You never saw a man more chapfallen.  

But had my name been Demogorgon, after so prolonged a mystery he 

had still been disappointed.



There were no emigrants direct from Europe - save one German family 

and a knot of Cornish miners who kept grimly by themselves, one 

reading the New Testament all day long through steel spectacles, 

the rest discussing privately the secrets of their old-world, 

mysterious race.  Lady Hester Stanhope believed she could make 

something great of the Cornish; for my part, I can make nothing of 

them at all.  A division of races, older and more original than 

that of Babel, keeps this close, esoteric family apart from 

neighbouring Englishmen.  Not even a Red Indian seems more foreign 

in my eyes.  This is one of the lessons of travel - that some of 

the strangest races dwell next door to you at home.



The rest were all American born, but they came from almost every 

quarter of that Continent.  All the States of the North had sent 

out a fugitive to cross the plains with me.  From Virginia, from 

Pennsylvania, from New York, from far western Iowa and Kansas, from 

Maime that borders on the Canadas, and from the Canadas themselves 

- some one or two were fleeing in quest of a better land and better 

wages.  The talk in the train, like the talk I heard on the 

steamer, ran upon hard times, short commons, and hope that moves 

ever westward.  I thought of my shipful from Great Britain with a 

feeling of despair.  They had come 3000 miles, and yet not far 

enough.  Hard times bowed them out of the Clyde, and stood to 

welcome them at Sandy Hook.  Where were they to go?  Pennsylvania, 

Maine, Iowa, Kansas?  These were not places for immigration, but 

for emigration, it appeared; not one of them, but I knew a man who 

had lifted up his heel and left it for an ungrateful country.  And 

it was still westward that they ran.  Hunger, you would have 

thought, came out of the east like the sun, and the evening was 

made of edible gold.  And, meantime, in the car in front of me, 

were there not half a hundred emigrants from the opposite quarter?  

Hungry Europe and hungry China, each pouring from their gates in 

search of provender, had here come face to face.  The two waves had 

met; east and west had alike failed; the whole round world had been 

prospected and condemned; there was no El Dorado anywhere; and till 

one could emigrate to the moon, it seemed as well to stay patiently 

at home.  Nor was there wanting another sign, at once more 

picturesque and more disheartening; for, as we continued to steam 

westward toward the land of gold, we were continually passing other 

emigrant trains upon the journey east; and these were as crowded as 

our own.  Had all these return voyagers made a fortune in the 

mines?  Were they all bound for Paris, and to be in Rome by Easter?  

It would seem not, for, whenever we met them, the passengers ran on 

the platform and cried to us through the windows, in a kind of 

wailing chorus, to "come back."  On the plains of Nebraska, in the 

mountains of Wyoming, it was still the same cry, and dismal to my 

heart, "Come back!"  That was what we heard by the way "about the 

good country we were going to."  And at that very hour the Sand-lot 

of San Francisco was crowded with the unemployed, and the echo from 

the other side of Market Street was repeating the rant of 

demagogues.



If, in truth, it were only for the sake of wages that men emigrate, 

how many thousands would regret the bargain!  But wages, indeed, 

are only one consideration out of many; for we are a race of 

gipsies, and love change and travel for themselves.





DESPISED RACES





Of all stupid ill-feelings, the sentiment of my fellow Caucasians 

towards our companions in the Chinese car was the most stupid and 

the worst.  They seemed never to have looked at them, listened to 

them, or thought of them, but hated them A PRIORI.  The Mongols 

were their enemies in that cruel and treacherous battle-field of 

money.  They could work better and cheaper in half a hundred 

industries, and hence there was no calumny too idle for the 

Caucasians to repeat, and even to believe.  They declared them 

hideous vermin, and affected a kind of choking in the throat when 

they beheld them.  Now, as a matter of fact, the young Chinese man 

is so like a large class of European women, that on raising my head 

and suddenly catching sight of one at a considerable distance, I 

have for an instant been deceived by the resemblance.  I do not say 

it is the most attractive class of our women, but for all that many 

a man's wife is less pleasantly favoured.  Again, my emigrants 

declared that the Chinese were dirty.  I cannot say they were 

clean, for that was impossible upon the journey; but in their 

efforts after cleanliness they put the rest of us to shame.  We all 

pigged and stewed in one infamy, wet our hands and faces for half a 

minute daily on the platform, and were unashamed.  But the Chinese 

never lost an opportunity, and you would see them washing their 

feet - an act not dreamed of among ourselves - and going as far as 

decency permitted to wash their whole bodies.  I may remark by the 

way that the dirtier people are in their persons the more delicate 

is their sense of modesty.  A clean man strips in a crowded 

boathouse; but he who is unwashed slinks in and out of bed without 

uncovering an inch of skin.  Lastly, these very foul and malodorous 

Caucasians entertained the surprising illusion that it was the 

Chinese waggon, and that alone, which stank.  I have said already 

that it was the exceptions and notably the freshest of the three.



These judgments are typical of the feeling in all Western America.  

The Chinese are considered stupid, because they are imperfectly 

acquainted with English.  They are held to be base, because their 

dexterity and frugality enable them to underbid the lazy, luxurious 

Caucasian.  They are said to be thieves; I am sure they have no 

monopoly of that.  They are called cruel; the Anglo-Saxon and the 

cheerful Irishman may each reflect before he bears the accusation.  

I am told, again, that they are of the race of river pirates, and 

belong to the most despised and dangerous class in the Celestial 

Empire.  But if this be so, what remarkable pirates have we here! 

and what must be the virtues, the industry, the education, and the 

intelligence of their superiors at home!



Awhile ago it was the Irish, now it is the Chinese that must go.  

Such is the cry.  It seems, after all, that no country is bound to 

submit to immigration any more than to invasion; each is war to the 

knife, and resistance to either but legitimate defence.  Yet we may 

regret the free tradition of the republic, which loved to depict 

herself with open arms, welcoming all unfortunates.  And certainly, 

as a man who believes that he loves freedom, I may be excused some 

bitterness when I find her sacred name misused in the contention.  

It was but the other day that I heard a vulgar fellow in the Sand-

lot, the popular tribune of San Francisco, roaring for arms and 

butchery.  "At the call of Abraham Lincoln," said the orator, "ye 

rose in the name of freedom to set free the negroes; can ye not 

rise and liberate yourselves from a few dirty Mongolians?"



For my own part, I could not look but with wonder and respect on 

the Chinese.  Their forefathers watched the stars before mine had 

begun to keep pigs.  Gun-powder and printing, which the other day 

we imitated, and a school of manners which we never had the 

delicacy so much as to desire to imitate, were theirs in a long-

past antiquity.  They walk the earth with us, but it seems they 

must be of different clay.  They hear the clock strike the same 

hour, yet surely of a different epoch.  They travel by steam 

conveyance, yet with such a baggage of old Asiatic thoughts and 

superstitions as might check the locomotive in its course.  

Whatever is thought within the circuit of the Great Wall; what the 

wry-eyed, spectacled schoolmaster teaches in the hamlets round 

Pekin; religions so old that our language looks a halfing boy 

alongside; philosophy so wise that our best philosophers find 

things therein to wonder at; all this travelled alongside of me for 

thousands of miles over plain and mountain.  Heaven knows if we had 

one common thought or fancy all that way, or whether our eyes, 

which yet were formed upon the same design, beheld the same world 

out of the railway windows.  And when either of us turned his 

thoughts to home and childhood, what a strange dissimilarity must 

there not have been in these pictures of the mind - when I beheld 

that old, gray, castled city, high throned above the firth, with 

the flag of Britain flying, and the red-coat sentry pacing over 

all; and the man in the next car to me would conjure up some junks 

and a pagoda and a fort of porcelain, and call it, with the same 

affection, home.



Another race shared among my fellow-passengers in the disfavour of 

the Chinese; and that, it is hardly necessary to say, was the noble 

red man of old story - over whose own hereditary continent we had 

been steaming all these days.  I saw no wild or independent Indian; 

indeed, I hear that such avoid the neighbourhood of the train; but 

now and again at way stations, a husband and wife and a few 

children, disgracefully dressed out with the sweepings of 

civilisation, came forth and stared upon the emigrants.  The silent 

stoicism of their conduct, and the pathetic degradation of their 

appearance, would have touched any thinking creature, but my 

fellow-passengers danced and jested round them with a truly Cockney 

baseness.  I was ashamed for the thing we call civilisation.  We 

should carry upon our consciences so much, at least, of our 

forefathers' misconduct as we continue to profit by ourselves.



If oppression drives a wise man mad, what should be raging in the 

hearts of these poor tribes, who have been driven back and back, 

step after step, their promised reservations torn from them one 

after another as the States extended westward, until at length they 

are shut up into these hideous mountain deserts of the centre - and 

even there find themselves invaded, insulted, and hunted out by 

ruffianly diggers?  The eviction of the Cherokees (to name but an 

instance), the extortion of Indian agents, the outrages of the 

wicked, the ill-faith of all, nay, down to the ridicule of such 

poor beings as were here with me upon the train, make up a chapter 

of injustice and indignity such as a man must be in some ways base 

if his heart will suffer him to pardon or forget.  These old, well-

founded, historical hatreds have a savour of nobility for the 

independent.  That the Jew should not love the Christian, nor the 

Irishman love the English, nor the Indian brave tolerate the 

thought of the American, is not disgraceful to the nature of man; 

rather, indeed, honourable, since it depends on wrongs ancient like 

the race, and not personal to him who cherishes the indignation.





TO THE GOLDEN GATES





A little corner of Utah is soon traversed, and leaves no particular 

impressions on the mind.  By an early hour on Wednesday morning we 

stopped to breakfast at Toano, a little station on a bleak, high-

lying plateau in Nevada.  The man who kept the station eating-house 

was a Scot, and learning that I was the same, he grew very 

friendly, and gave me some advice on the country I was now 

entering.  "You see," said he, "I tell you this, because I come 

from your country."  Hail, brither Scots!



His most important hint was on the moneys of this part of the 

world.  There is something in the simplicity of a decimal coinage 

which is revolting to the human mind; thus the French, in small 

affairs, reckon strictly by halfpence; and you have to solve, by a 

spasm of mental arithmetic, such posers as thirty-two, forty-five, 

or even a hundred halfpence.  In the Pacific States they have made 

a bolder push for complexity, and settle their affairs by a coin 

that no longer that no longer exists - the BIT, or old Mexican 

real.  The supposed value of the bit is twelve and a half cents, 

eight to the dollar.  When it comes to two bits, the quarter-dollar 

stands for the required amount.  But how about an odd bit?  The 

nearest coin to it is a dime, which is, short by a fifth.  That, 

then, is called a SHORT bit.  If you have one, you lay it 

triumphantly down, and save two and a half cents.  But if you have 

not, and lay down a quarter, the bar-keeper or shopman calmly 

tenders you a dime by way of change; and thus you have paid what is 

called a LONG BIT, and lost two and a half cents, or even, by 

comparison with a short bit, five cents.  In country places all 

over the Pacific coast, nothing lower than a bit is ever asked or 

taken, which vastly increases the cost of life; as even for a glass 

of beer you must pay fivepence or sevenpence-halfpenny, as the case 

may be.  You would say that this system of mutual robbery was as 

broad as it was long; but I have discovered a plan to make it 

broader, with which I here endow the public.  It is brief and 

simple - radiantly simple.  There is one place where five cents are 

recognised, and that is the post-office.  A quarter is only worth 

two bits, a short and a long.  Whenever you have a quarter, go to 

the post-office and buy five cents worth of postage-stamps; you 

will receive in change two dimes, that is, two short bits.  The 

purchasing power of your money is undiminished.  You can go and 

have your two glasses of beer all the same; and you have made 

yourself a present of five cents worth of postage-stamps into the 

bargain.  Benjamin Franklin would have patted me on the head for 

this discovery.



From Toano we travelled all day through deserts of alkali and sand, 

horrible to man, and bare sage-brush country that seemed little 

kindlier, and came by supper-time to Elko.  As we were standing, 

after our manner, outside the station, I saw two men whip suddenly 

from underneath the cars, and take to their heels across country.  

They were tramps, it appeared, who had been riding on the beams 

since eleven of the night before; and several of my fellow-

passengers had already seen and conversed with them while we broke 

our fast at Toano.  These land stowaways play a great part over 

here in America, and I should have liked dearly to become 

acquainted with them.



At Elko an odd circumstance befell me.  I was coming out from 

supper, when I was stopped by a small, stout, ruddy man, followed 

by two others taller and ruddier than himself.



"Excuse me, sir," he said, "but do you happen to be going on?"



I said I was, whereupon he said he hoped to persuade me to desist 

from that intention.  He had a situation to offer me, and if we 

could come to terms, why, good and well.  "You see," he continued, 

"I'm running a theatre here, and we're a little short in the 

orchestra.  You're a musician, I guess?"



I assured him that, beyond a rudimentary acquaintance with "Auld 

Lang Syne" and "The Wearing of the Green," I had no pretension 

whatever to that style.  He seemed much put out of countenance; and 

one of his taller companions asked him, on the nail, for five 

dollars.



"You see, sir," added the latter to me, "he bet you were a 

musician; I bet you weren't.  No offence, I hope?"



"None whatever," I said, and the two withdrew to the bar, where I 

presume the debt was liquidated.



This little adventure woke bright hopes in my fellow-travellers, 

who thought they had now come to a country where situations went a-

begging.  But I am not so sure that the offer was in good faith.  

Indeed, I am more than half persuaded it was but a feeler to decide 

the bet.



Of all the next day I will tell you nothing, for the best of all 

reasons, that I remember no more than that we continued through 

desolate and desert scenes, fiery hot and deadly weary.  But some 

time after I had fallen asleep that night, I was awakened by one of 

my companions.  It was in vain that I resisted.  A fire of 

enthusiasm and whisky burned in his eyes; and he declared we were 

in a new country, and I must come forth upon the platform and see 

with my own eyes.  The train was then, in its patient way, standing 

halted in a by-track.  It was a clear, moonlit night; but the 

valley was too narrow to admit the moonshine direct, and only a 

diffused glimmer whitened the tall rocks and relieved the blackness 

of the pines.  A hoarse clamour filled the air; it was the 

continuous plunge of a cascade somewhere near at hand among the 

mountains.  The air struck chill, but tasted good and vigorous in 

the nostrils - a fine, dry, old mountain atmosphere.  I was dead 

sleepy, but I returned to roost with a grateful mountain feeling at 

my heart.



When I awoke next morning, I was puzzled for a while to know if it 

were day or night, for the illumination was unusual.  I sat up at 

last, and found we were grading slowly downward through a long 

snowshed; and suddenly we shot into an open; and before we were 

swallowed into the next length of wooden tunnel, I had one glimpse 

of a huge pine-forested ravine upon my left, a foaming river, and a 

sky already coloured with the fires of dawn.  I am usually very 

calm over the displays of nature; but you will scarce believe how 

my heart leaped at this.  It was like meeting one's wife.  I had 

come home again - home from unsightly deserts to the green and 

habitable corners of the earth.  Every spire of pine along the 

hill-top, every trouty pool along that mountain river, was more 

dear to me than a blood relation.  Few people have praised God more 

happily than I did.  And thenceforward, down by Blue Canon, Alta, 

Dutch Flat, and all the old mining camps, through a sea of mountain 

forests, dropping thousands of feet toward the far sea-level as we 

went, not I only, but all the passengers on board, threw off their 

sense of dirt and heat and weariness, and bawled like schoolboys, 

and thronged with shining eyes upon the platform and became new 

creatures within and without.  The sun no longer oppressed us with 

heat, it only shone laughingly along the mountain-side, until we 

were fain to laugh ourselves for glee.  At every turn we could see 

farther into the land and our own happy futures.  At every town the 

cocks were tossing their clear notes into the golden air, and 

crowing for the new day and the new country.  For this was indeed 

our destination; this was "the good country" we had been going to 

so long.



By afternoon we were at Sacramento, the city of gardens in a plain 

of corn; and the next day before the dawn we were lying to upon the 

Oakland side of San Francisco Bay.  The day was breaking as we 

crossed the ferry; the fog was rising over the citied hills of San 

Francisco; the bay was perfect - not a ripple, scarce a stain, upon 

its blue expanse; everything was waiting, breathless, for the sun.  

A spot of cloudy gold lit first upon the head of Tamalpais, and 

then widened downward on its shapely shoulder; the air seemed to 

awaken, and began to sparkle; and suddenly



"The tall hills Titan discovered,"



and the city of San Francisco, and the bay of gold and corn, were 

lit from end to end with summer daylight.
