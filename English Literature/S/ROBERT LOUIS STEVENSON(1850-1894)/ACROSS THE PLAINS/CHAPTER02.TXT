THE WOODS AND THE PACIFIC





THE Bay of Monterey has been compared by no less a person than 

General Sherman to a bent fishing-hook; and the comparison, if less 

important than the march through Georgia, still shows the eye of a 

soldier for topography.  Santa Cruz sits exposed at the shank; the 

mouth of the Salinas river is at the middle of the bend; and 

Monterey itself is cosily ensconced beside the barb.  Thus the 

ancient capital of California faces across the bay, while the 

Pacific Ocean, though hidden by low hills and forest, bombards her 

left flank and rear with never-dying surf.  In front of the town, 

the long line of sea-beach trends north and north-west, and then 

westward to enclose the bay.  The waves which lap so quietly about 

the jetties of Monterey grow louder and larger in the distance; you 

can see the breakers leaping high and white by day; at night, the 

outline of the shore is traced in transparent silver by the 

moonlight and the flying foam; and from all round, even in quiet 

weather, the distant, thrilling roar of the Pacific hangs over the 

coast and the adjacent country like smoke above a battle.



These long beaches are enticing to the idle man.  It would be hard 

to find a walk more solitary and at the same time more exciting to 

the mind.  Crowds of ducks and sea-gulls hover over the sea.  

Sandpipers trot in and out by troops after the retiring waves, 

trilling together in a chorus of infinitesimal song.  Strange sea-

tangles, new to the European eye, the bones of whales, or sometimes 

a whole whale's carcase, white with carrion-gulls and poisoning the 

wind, lie scattered here and there along the sands.  The waves come 

in slowly, vast and green, curve their translucent necks, and burst 

with a surprising uproar, that runs, waxing and waning, up and down 

the long key-board of the beach.  The foam of these great ruins 

mounts in an instant to the ridge of the sand glacis, swiftly 

fleets back again, and is met and buried by the next breaker.  The 

interest is perpetually fresh.  On no other coast that I know shall 

you enjoy, in calm, sunny weather, such a spectacle of Ocean's 

greatness, such beauty of changing colour, or such degrees of 

thunder in the sound.  The very air is more than usually salt by 

this Homeric deep.



Inshore, a tract of sand-hills borders on the beach.  Here and 

there a lagoon, more or less brackish, attracts the birds and 

hunters.  A rough, undergrowth partially conceals the sand.  The 

crouching, hardy live-oaks flourish singly or in thickets - the 

kind of wood for murderers to crawl among - and here and there the 

skirts of the forest extend downward from the hills with a floor of 

turf and long aisles of pine-trees hung with Spaniard's Beard.  

Through this quaint desert the railway cars drew near to Monterey 

from the junction at Salinas City - though that and so many other 

things are now for ever altered - and it was from here that you had 

the first view of the old township lying in the sands, its white 

windmills bickering in the chill, perpetual wind, and the first 

fogs of the evening drawing drearily around it from the sea.



The one common note of all this country is the haunting presence of 

the ocean.  A great faint sound of breakers follows you high up 

into the inland canons; the roar of water dwells in the clean, 

empty rooms of Monterey as in a shell upon the chimney; go where 

you will, you have but to pause and listen to hear the voice of the 

Pacific.  You pass out of the town to the south-west, and mount the 

hill among pine-woods.  Glade, thicket, and grove surround you.  

You follow winding sandy tracks that lead nowhither.  You see a 

deer; a multitude of quail arises.  But the sound of the sea still 

follows you as you advance, like that of wind among the trees, only 

harsher and stranger to the ear; and when at length you gain the 

summit, out breaks on every hand and with freshened vigour that 

same unending, distant, whispering rumble of the ocean; for now you 

are on the top of Monterey peninsula, and the noise no longer only 

mounts to you from behind along the beach towards Santa Cruz, but 

from your right also, round by Chinatown and Pinos lighthouse, and 

from down before you to the mouth of the Carmello river.  The whole 

woodland is begirt with thundering surges.  The silence that 

immediately surrounds you where you stand is not so much broken as 

it is haunted by this distant, circling rumour.  It sets your 

senses upon edge; you strain your attention; you are clearly and 

unusually conscious of small sounds near at hand; you walk 

listening like an Indian hunter; and that voice of the Pacific is a 

sort of disquieting company to you in your walk.



When once I was in these woods I found it difficult to turn 

homeward.  All woods lure a rambler onward; but in those of 

Monterey it was the surf that particularly invited me to prolong my 

walks.  I would push straight for the shore where I thought it to 

be nearest.  Indeed, there was scarce a direction that would not, 

sooner or later, have brought me forth on the Pacific.  The 

emptiness of the woods gave me a sense of freedom and discovery in 

these excursions.  I never in all my visits met but one man.  He 

was a Mexican, very dark of hue, but smiling and fat, and he 

carried an axe, though his true business at that moment was to seek 

for straying cattle.  I asked him what o'clock it was, but he 

seemed neither to know nor care; and when he in his turn asked me 

for news of his cattle, I showed myself equally indifferent.  We 

stood and smiled upon each other for a few seconds, and then turned 

without a word and took our several ways across the forest.



One day - I shall never forget it - I had taken a trail that was 

new to me.  After a while the woods began to open, the sea to sound 

nearer hand.  I came upon a road, and, to my surprise, a stile.  A 

step or two farther, and, without leaving the woods, I found myself 

among trim houses.  I walked through street after street, parallel 

and at right angles, paved with sward and dotted with trees, but 

still undeniable streets, and each with its name posted at the 

corner, as in a real town.  Facing down the main thoroughfare - 

"Central Avenue," as it was ticketed - I saw an open-air temple, 

with benches and sounding-board, as though for an orchestra.  The 

houses were all tightly shuttered; there was no smoke, no sound but 

of the waves, no moving thing.  I have never been in any place that 

seemed so dreamlike.  Pompeii is all in a bustle with visitors, and 

its antiquity and strangeness deceive the imagination; but this 

town had plainly not been built above a year or two, and perhaps 

had been deserted overnight.  Indeed, it was not so much like a 

deserted town as like a scene upon the stage by daylight, and with 

no one on the boards.  The barking of a dog led me at last to the 

only house still occupied, where a Scotch pastor and his wife pass 

the winter alone in this empty theatre.  The place was "The Pacific 

Camp Grounds, the Christian Seaside Resort."  Thither, in the warm 

season, crowds come to enjoy a life of teetotalism, religion, and 

flirtation, which I am willing to think blameless and agreeable.  

The neighbourhood at least is well selected.  The Pacific booms in 

front.  Westward is Point Pinos, with the lighthouse in a 

wilderness of sand, where you will find the lightkeeper playing the 

piano, making models and bows and arrows, studying dawn and sunrise 

in amateur oil-painting, and with a dozen other elegant pursuits 

and interests to surprise his brave, old-country rivals.  To the 

east, and still nearer, you will come upon a space of open down, a 

hamlet, a haven among rocks, a world of surge and screaming sea-

gulls.  Such scenes are very similar in different climates; they 

appear homely to the eyes of all; to me this was like a dozen spots 

in Scotland.  And yet the boats that ride in the haven are of 

strange outlandish design; and, if you walk into the hamlet, you 

will behold costumes and faces and hear a tongue that are 

unfamiliar to the memory.  The joss-stick burns, the opium pipe is 

smoked, the floors are strewn with slips of coloured paper - 

prayers, you would say, that had somehow missed their destination - 

and a man guiding his upright pencil from right to left across the 

sheet, writes home the news of Monterey to the Celestial Empire.



The woods and the Pacific rule between them the climate of this 

seaboard region.  On the streets of Monterey, when the air does not 

smell salt from the one, it will be blowing perfumed from the 

resinous tree-tops of the other.  For days together a hot, dry air 

will overhang the town, close as from an oven, yet healthful and 

aromatic in the nostrils.  The cause is not far to seek, for the 

woods are afire, and the hot wind is blowing from the hills.  These 

fires are one of the great dangers of California.  I have seen from 

Monterey as many as three at the same time, by day a cloud of 

smoke, by night a red coal of conflagration in the distance.  A 

little thing will start them, and, if the wind be favourable, they 

gallop over miles of country faster than a horse.  The inhabitants 

must turn out and work like demons, for it is not only the pleasant 

groves that are destroyed; the climate and the soil are equally at 

stake, and these fires prevent the rains of the next winter and dry 

up perennial fountains.  California has been a land of promise in 

its time, like Palestine; but if the woods continue so swiftly to 

perish, it may become, like Palestine, a land of desolation.



To visit the woods while they are languidly burning is a strange 

piece of experience.  The fire passes through the underbrush at a 

run.  Every here and there a tree flares up instantaneously from 

root to summit, scattering tufts of flame, and is quenched, it 

seems, as quickly.  But this last is only in semblance.  For after 

this first squib-like conflagration of the dry moss and twigs, 

there remains behind a deep-rooted and consuming fire in the very 

entrails of the tree.  The resin of the pitch-pine is principally 

condensed at the base of the bole and in the spreading roots.  

Thus, after the light, showy, skirmishing flames, which are only as 

the match to the explosion, have already scampered down the wind 

into the distance, the true harm is but beginning for this giant of 

the woods.  You may approach the tree from one side, and see it 

scorched indeed from top to bottom, but apparently survivor of the 

peril.  Make the circuit, and there, on the other side of the 

column, is a clear mass of living coal, spreading like an ulcer; 

while underground, to their most extended fibre, the roots are 

being eaten out by fire, and the smoke is rising through the 

fissures to the surface.  A little while, and, without a nod of 

warning, the huge pine-tree snaps off short across the ground and 

falls prostrate with a crash.  Meanwhile the fire continues its 

silent business; the roots are reduced to a fine ash; and long 

afterwards, if you pass by, you will find the earth pierced with 

radiating galleries, and preserving the design of all these 

subterranean spurs, as though it were the mould for a new tree 

instead of the print of an old one.  These pitch-pines of Monterey 

are, with the single exception of the Monterey cypress, the most 

fantastic of forest trees.  No words can give an idea of the 

contortion of their growth; they might figure without change in a 

circle of the nether hell as Dante pictured it; and at the rate at 

which trees grow, and at which forest fires spring up and gallop 

through the hills of California, we may look forward to a time when 

there will not be one of them left standing in that land of their 

nativity.  At least they have not so much to fear from the axe, but 

perish by what may be called a natural although a violent death; 

while it is man in his short-sighted greed that robs the country of 

the nobler redwood.  Yet a little while and perhaps all the hills 

of seaboard California may be as bald as Tamalpais.



I have an interest of my own in these forest fires, for I came so 

near to lynching on one occasion, that a braver man might have 

retained a thrill from the experience.  I wished to be certain 

whether it was the moss, that quaint funereal ornament of 

Californian forests, which blazed up so rapidly when the flame 

first touched the tree.  I suppose I must have been under the 

influence of Satan, for instead of plucking off a piece for my 

experiment what should I do but walk up to a great pine-tree in a 

portion of the wood which had escaped so much as scorching, strike 

a match, and apply the flame gingerly to one of the tassels.  The 

tree went off simply like a rocket; in three seconds it was a 

roaring pillar of fire.  Close by I could hear the shouts of those 

who were at work combating the original conflagration.  I could see 

the waggon that had brought them tied to a live oak in a piece of 

open; I could even catch the flash of an axe as it swung up through 

the underwood into the sunlight.  Had any one observed the result 

of my experiment my neck was literally not worth a pinch of snuff; 

after a few minutes of passionate expostulation I should have been 

run up to convenient bough.



To die for faction is a common evil;

But to be hanged for nonsense is the devil.



I have run repeatedly, but never as I ran that day.  At night I 

went out of town, and there was my own particular fire, quite 

distinct from the other, and burning as I thought with even greater 

vigour.



But it is the Pacific that exercises the most direct and obvious 

power upon the climate.  At sunset, for months together, vast, wet, 

melancholy fogs arise and come shoreward from the ocean.  From the 

hill-top above Monterey the scene is often noble, although it is 

always sad.  The upper air is still bright with sunlight; a glow 

still rests upon the Gabelano Peak; but the fogs are in possession 

of the lower levels; they crawl in scarves among the sandhills; 

they float, a little higher, in clouds of a gigantic size and often 

of a wild configuration; to the south, where they have struck the 

seaward shoulder of the mountains of Santa Lucia, they double back 

and spire up skyward like smoke.  Where their shadow touches, 

colour dies out of the world.  The air grows chill and deadly as 

they advance.  The trade-wind freshens, the trees begin to sigh, 

and all the windmills in Monterey are whirling and creaking and 

filling their cisterns with the brackish water of the sands.  It 

takes but a little while till the invasion is complete.  The sea, 

in its lighter order, has submerged the earth.  Monterey is 

curtained in for the night in thick, wet, salt, and frigid clouds, 

so to remain till day returns; and before the sun's rays they 

slowly disperse and retreat in broken squadrons to the bosom of the 

sea.  And yet often when the fog is thickest and most chill, a few 

steps out of the town and up the slope, the night will be dry and 

warm and full of inland perfume.





MEXICANS, AMERICANS, AND INDIANS





The history of Monterey has yet to be written.  Founded by Catholic 

missionaries, a place of wise beneficence to Indians, a place of 

arms, a Mexican capital continually wrested by one faction from 

another, an American capital when the first House of 

Representatives held its deliberations, and then falling lower and 

lower from the capital of the State to the capital of a county, and 

from that again, by the loss of its charter and town lands, to a 

mere bankrupt village, its rise and decline is typical of that of 

all Mexican institutions and even Mexican families in California.



Nothing is stranger in that strange State than the rapidity with 

which the soil has changed-hands.  The Mexicans, you may say, are 

all poor and landless, like their former capital; and yet both it 

and they hold themselves apart and preserve their ancient customs 

and something of their ancient air.



The town, when I was there, was a place of two or three streets, 

economically paved with sea-sand, and two or three lanes, which 

were watercourses in the rainy season, and were, at all times, rent 

up by fissures four or five feet deep.  There were no street 

lights.  Short sections of wooden sidewalk only added to the 

dangers of the night, for they were often high above the level of 

the roadway, and no one could tell where they would be likely to 

begin or end.  The houses were, for the most part, built of unbaked 

adobe brick, many of them old for so new a country, some of very 

elegant proportions, with low, spacious, shapely rooms, and walls 

so thick that the heat of summer never dried them to the heart.  At 

the approach of the rainy season a deathly chill and a graveyard 

smell began to hang about the lower floors; and diseases of the 

chest are common and fatal among house-keeping people of either 

sex.



There was no activity but in and around the saloons, where people 

sat almost all day long playing cards.  The smallest excursion was 

made on horseback.  You would scarcely ever see the main street 

without a horse or two tied to posts, and making a fine figure with 

their Mexican housings.  It struck me oddly to come across some of 

the CORNHILL illustrations to Mr. Blackmore's EREMA, and see all 

the characters astride on English saddles.  As a matter of fact, an 

English saddle is a rarity even in San Francisco, and, you may say, 

a thing unknown in all the rest of California.  In a place so 

exclusively Mexican as Monterey, you saw not only Mexican saddles 

but true Vaquero riding - men always at the hand-gallop up hill and 

down dale, and round the sharpest corner, urging their horses with 

cries and gesticulations and cruel rotatory spurs, checking them 

dead with a touch, or wheeling them right-about-face in a square 

yard.  The type of face and character of bearing are surprisingly 

un-American.  The first ranged from something like the pure 

Spanish, to something, in its sad fixity, not unlike the pure 

Indian, although I do not suppose there was one pure blood of 

either race in all the country.  As for the second, it was a matter 

of perpetual surprise to find, in that world of absolutely 

mannerless Americans, a people full of deportment, solemnly 

courteous, and doing all things with grace and decorum.  In dress 

they ran to colour and bright sashes.  Not even the most 

Americanised could always resist the temptation to stick a red rose 

into his hat-band.  Not even the most Americanised would descend to 

wear the vile dress hat of civilisation.  Spanish was the language 

of the streets.  It was difficult to get along without a word or 

two of that language for an occasion.  The only communications in 

which the population joined were with a view to amusement.  A 

weekly public ball took place with great etiquette, in addition to 

the numerous fandangoes in private houses.  There was a really fair 

amateur brass band.  Night after night serenaders would be going 

about the street, sometimes in a company and with several 

instruments and voice together, sometimes severally, each guitar 

before a different window.  It was a strange thing to lie awake in 

nineteenth-century America, and hear the guitar accompany, and one 

of these old, heart-breaking Spanish love-songs mount into the 

night air, perhaps in a deep baritone, perhaps in that high-

pitched, pathetic, womanish alto which is so common among Mexican 

men, and which strikes on the unaccustomed ear as something not 

entirely human but altogether sad.



The town, then, was essentially and wholly Mexican; and yet almost 

all the land in the neighbourhood was held by Americans, and it was 

from the same class, numerically so small, that the principal 

officials were selected.  This Mexican and that Mexican would 

describe to you his old family estates, not one rood of which 

remained to him.  You would ask him how that came about, and elicit 

some tangled story back-foremost, from which you gathered that the 

Americans had been greedy like designing men, and the Mexicans 

greedy like children, but no other certain fact.  Their merits and 

their faults contributed alike to the ruin of the former 

landholders.  It is true they were improvident, and easily dazzled 

with the sight of ready money; but they were gentlefolk besides, 

and that in a way which curiously unfitted them to combat Yankee 

craft.  Suppose they have a paper to sign, they would think it a 

reflection on the other party to examine the terms with any great 

minuteness; nay, suppose them to observe some doubtful clause, it 

is ten to one they would refuse from delicacy to object to it.  I 

know I am speaking within the mark, for I have seen such a case 

occur, and the Mexican, in spite of the advice of his lawyer, has 

signed the imperfect paper like a lamb.  To have spoken in the 

matter, he said, above all to have let the other party guess that 

he had seen a lawyer, would have "been like doubting his word."  

The scruple sounds oddly to one of ourselves, who have been brought 

up to understand all business as a competition in fraud, and 

honesty itself to be a virtue which regards the carrying out but 

not the creation of agreements.  This single unworldly trait will 

account for much of that revolution of which we are speaking.  The 

Mexicans have the name of being great swindlers, but certainly the 

accusation cuts both ways.  In a contest of this sort, the entire 

booty would scarcely have passed into the hands of the more 

scupulous race.



Physically the Americans have triumphed; but it is not entirely 

seen how far they have themselves been morally conquered.  This is, 

of course, but a part of a part of an extraordinary problem now in 

the course of being solved in the various States of the American 

Union.  I am reminded of an anecdote.  Some years ago, at a great 

sale of wine, all the odd lots were purchased by a grocer in a 

small way in the old town of Edinburgh.  The agent had the 

curiosity to visit him some time after and inquire what possible 

use he could have for such material.  He was shown, by way of 

answer, a huge vat where all the liquors, from humble Gladstone to 

imperial Tokay, were fermenting together.  "And what," he asked, 

"do you propose to call this?"  "I'm no very sure," replied the 

grocer, "but I think it's going to turn out port."  In the older 

Eastern States, I think we may say that this hotch-potch of races 

in going to turn out English, or thereabout.  But the problem is 

indefinitely varied in other zones.  The elements are differently 

mingled in the south, in what we may call the Territorial belt and 

in the group of States on the Pacific coast.  Above all, in these 

last, we may look to see some monstrous hybrid - Whether good or 

evil, who shall forecast? but certainly original and all their own.  

In my little restaurant at Monterey, we have sat down to table day 

after day, a Frenchman, two Portuguese, an Italian, a Mexican, and 

a Scotchman:  we had for common visitors an American from Illinois, 

a nearly pure blood Indian woman, and a naturalised Chinese; and 

from time to time a Switzer and a German came down from country 

ranches for the night.  No wonder that the Pacific coast is a 

foreign land to visitors from the Eastern States, for each race 

contributes something of its own.  Even the despised Chinese have 

taught the youth of California, none indeed of their virtues, but 

the debasing use of opium.  And chief among these influences is 

that of the Mexicans.



The Mexicans although in the State are out of it.  They still 

preserve a sort of international independence, and keep their 

affairs snug to themselves.  Only four or five years ago Vasquez, 

the bandit, his troops being dispersed and the hunt too hot for him 

in other parts of California, returned to his native Monterey, and 

was seen publicly in her streets and saloons, fearing no man.  The 

year that I was there, there occurred two reputed murders.  As the 

Montereyans are exceptionally vile speakers of each other and of 

every one behind his back, it is not possible for me to judge how 

much truth there may have been in these reports; but in the one 

case every one believed, and in the other some suspected, that 

there had been foul play; and nobody dreamed for an instant of 

taking the authorities into their counsel.  Now this is, of course, 

characteristic enough of the Mexicans; but it is a noteworthy 

feature that all the Americans in Monterey acquiesced without a 

word in this inaction.  Even when I spoke to them upon the subject, 

they seemed not to understand my surprise; they had forgotten the 

traditions of their own race and upbringing, and become, in a word, 

wholly Mexicanised.



Again, the Mexicans, having no ready money to speak of, rely almost 

entirely in their business transactions upon each other's worthless 

paper.  Pedro the penniless pays you with an I O U from the equally 

penniless Miguel.  It is a sort of local currency by courtesy.  

Credit in these parts has passed into a superstition.  I have seen 

a strong, violent man struggling for months to recover a debt, and 

getting nothing but an exchange of waste paper.  The very 

storekeepers are averse to asking for cash payments, and are more 

surprised than pleased when they are offered.  They fear there must 

be something under it, and that you mean to withdraw your custom 

from them.  I have seen the enterprising chemist and stationer 

begging me with fervour to let my account run on, although I had my 

purse open in my hand; and partly from the commonness of the case, 

partly from some remains of that generous old Mexican tradition 

which made all men welcome to their tables, a person may be 

notoriously both unwilling and unable to pay, and still find credit 

for the necessaries of life in the stores of Monterey.  Now this 

villainous habit of living upon "tick" has grown into Californian 

nature.  I do not mean that the American and European storekeepers 

of Monterey are as lax as Mexicans; I mean that American farmers in 

many parts of the State expect unlimited credit, and profit by it 

in the meanwhile, without a thought for consequences.  Jew 

storekeepers have already learned the advantage to be gained from 

this; they lead on the farmer into irretrievable indebtedness, and 

keep him ever after as their bond-slave hopelessly grinding in the 

mill.  So the whirligig of time brings in its revenges, and except 

that the Jew knows better than to foreclose, you may see Americans 

bound in the same chains with which they themselves had formerly 

bound the Mexican.  It seems as if certain sorts of follies, like 

certain sorts of grain, were natural to the soil rather than to the 

race that holds and tills it for the moment.



In the meantime, however, the Americans rule in Monterey County.  

The new county seat, Salinas City, in the bald, corn-bearing plain 

under the Gabelano Peak, is a town of a purely American character.  

The land is held, for the most part, in those enormous tracts which 

are another legacy of Mexican days, and form the present chief 

danger and disgrace of California; and the holders are mostly of 

American or British birth.  We have here in England no idea of the 

troubles and inconveniences which flow from the existence of these 

large landholders - land-thieves, land-sharks, or land-grabbers, 

they are more commonly and plainly called.  Thus the townlands of 

Monterey are all in the hands of a single man.  How they came there 

is an obscure, vexatious question, and, rightly or wrongly, the man 

is hated with a great hatred.  His life has been repeatedly in 

danger.  Not very long ago, I was told, the stage was stopped and 

examined three evenings in succession by disguised horsemen 

thirsting for his blood.  A certain house on the Salinas road, they 

say, he always passes in his buggy at full speed, for the squatter 

sent him warning long ago.  But a year since he was publicly 

pointed out for death by no less a man than Mr. Dennis Kearney.  

Kearney is a man too well known in California, but a word of 

explanation is required for English readers.  Originally an Irish 

dray-man, he rose, by his command of bad language, to almost 

dictatorial authority in the State; throned it there for six months 

or so, his mouth full of oaths, gallowses, and conflagrations; was 

first snuffed out last winter by Mr. Coleman, backed by his San 

Francisco Vigilantes and three gatling guns; completed his own ruin 

by throwing in his lot with the grotesque Green-backer party; and 

had at last to be rescued by his old enemies, the police, out of 

the hands of his rebellious followers.  It was while he was at the 

top of his fortune that Kearney visited Monterey with his battle-

cry against Chinese labour, the railroad monopolists, and the land-

thieves; and his one articulate counsel to the Montereyans was to 

"hang David Jacks."  Had the town been American, in my private 

opinion, this would have been done years ago.  Land is a subject on 

which there is no jesting in the West, and I have seen my friend 

the lawyer drive out of Monterey to adjust a competition of titles 

with the face of a captain going into battle and his Smith-and-

Wesson convenient to his hand.



On the ranche of another of these landholders you may find our old 

friend, the truck system, in full operation.  Men live there, year 

in year out, to cut timber for a nominal wage, which is all 

consumed in supplies.  The longer they remain in this desirable 

service the deeper they will fall in debt - a burlesque injustice 

in a new country, where labour should be precious, and one of those 

typical instances which explains the prevailing discontent and the 

success of the demagogue Kearney.



In a comparison between what was and what is in California, the 

praisers of times past will fix upon the Indians of Carmel.  The 

valley drained by the river so named is a true Californian valley, 

bare, dotted with chaparal, overlooked by quaint, unfinished hills.  

The Carmel runs by many pleasant farms, a clear and shallow river, 

loved by wading kine; and at last, as it is falling towards a 

quicksand and the great Pacific, passes a ruined mission on a hill.  

From the mission church the eye embraces a great field of ocean, 

and the ear is filled with a continuous sound of distant breakers 

on the shore.  But the day of the Jesuit has gone by, the day of 

the Yankee has succeeded, and there is no one left to care for the 

converted savage.  The church is roofless and ruinous, sea-breezes 

and sea-fogs, and the alternation of the rain and sunshine, daily 

widening the breaches and casting the crockets from the wall.  As 

an antiquity in this new land, a quaint specimen of missionary 

architecture, and a memorial of good deeds, it had a triple claim 

to preservation from all thinking people; but neglect and abuse 

have been its portion.  There is no sign of American interference, 

save where a headboard has been torn from a grave to be a mark for 

pistol bullets.  So it is with the Indians for whom it was erected.  

Their lands, I was told, are being yearly encroached upon by the 

neighbouring American proprietor, and with that exception no man 

troubles his head for the Indians of Carmel.  Only one day in the 

year, the day before our Guy Fawkes, the PADRE drives over the hill 

from Monterey; the little sacristy, which is the only covered 

portion of the church, is filled with seats and decorated for the 

service; the Indians troop together, their bright dresses 

contrasting with their dark and melancholy faces; and there, among 

a crowd of somewhat unsympathetic holiday-makers, you may hear God 

served with perhaps more touching circumstances than in any other 

temple under heaven.  An Indian, stone-blind and about eighty years 

of age, conducts the singing; other Indians compose the choir; yet 

they have the Gregorian music at their finger ends, and pronounce 

the Latin so correctly that I could follow the meaning as they 

sang.  The pronunciation was odd and nasal, the singing hurried and 

staccato.  "In saecula saeculoho-horum," they went, with a vigorous 

aspirate to every additional syllable.  I have never seen faces 

more vividly lit up with joy than the faces of these Indian 

singers.  It was to them not only the worship of God, nor an act by 

which they recalled and commemorated better days, but was besides 

an exercise of culture, where all they knew of art and letters was 

united and expressed.  And it made a man's heart sorry for the good 

fathers of yore who had taught them to dig and to reap, to read and 

to sing, who had given them European mass-books which they still 

preserve and study in their cottages, and who had now passed away 

from all authority and influence in that land - to be succeeded by 

greedy land-thieves and sacrilegious pistol-shots.  So ugly a thing 

may our Anglo-Saxon Protestantism appear beside the doings of the 

Society of Jesus.



But revolution in this world succeeds to revolution.  All that I 

say in this paper is in a paulo-past tense.  The Monterey of last 

year exists no longer.  A huge hotel has sprung up in the desert by 

the railway.  Three sets of diners sit down successively to table.  

Invaluable toilettes figure along the beach and between the live 

oaks; and Monterey is advertised in the newspapers, and posted in 

the waiting-rooms at railway stations, as a resort for wealth and 

fashion.  Alas for the little town! it is not strong enough to 

resist the influence of the flaunting caravanserai, and the poor, 

quaint, penniless native gentlemen of Monterey must perish, like a 

lower race, before the millionaire vulgarians of the Big Bonanza.
