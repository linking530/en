CAREER OF ART







WITH the agreeable frankness of youth, you address me on a point of 

some practical importance to yourself and (it is even conceivable) 

of some gravity to the world:  Should you or should you not become 

an artist?  It is one which you must decide entirely for yourself; 

all that I can do is to bring under your notice some of the 

materials of that decision; and I will begin, as I shall probably 

conclude also, by assuring you that all depends on the vocation.



To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age.  

Youth is wholly experimental.  The essence and charm of that 

unquiet and delightful epoch is ignorance of self as well as 

ignorance of life.  These two unknowns the young man brings 

together again and again, now in the airiest touch, now with a 

bitter hug; now with exquisite pleasure, now with cutting pain; but 

never with indifference, to which he is a total stranger, and never 

with that near kinsman of indifference, contentment.  If he be a 

youth of dainty senses or a brain easily heated, the interest of 

this series of experiments grows upon him out of all proportion to 

the pleasure he receives.  It is not beauty that he loves, nor 

pleasure that he seeks, though he may think so; his design and his 

sufficient reward is to verify his own existence and taste the 

variety of human fate.  To him, before the razor-edge of curiosity 

is dulled, all that is not actual living and the hot chase of 

experience wears a face of a disgusting dryness difficult to recall 

in later days; or if there be any exception - and here destiny 

steps in - it is in those moments when, wearied or surfeited of the 

primary activity of the senses, he calls up before memory the image 

of transacted pains and pleasures.  Thus it is that such an one 

shies from all cut-and-dry professions, and inclines insensibly 

toward that career of art which consists only in the tasting and 

recording of experience.



This, which is not so much a vocation for art as an impatience of 

all other honest trades, frequently exists alone; and so existing, 

it will pass gently away in the course of years.  Emphatically, it 

is not to be regarded; it is not a vocation, but a temptation; and 

when your father the other day so fiercely and (in my view) so 

properly discouraged your ambition, he was recalling not improbably 

some similar passage in his own experience.  For the temptation is 

perhaps nearly as common as the vocation is rare.  But again we 

have vocations which are imperfect; we have men whose minds are 

bound up, not so much in any art, as in the general ARS ARTIUM and 

common base of all creative work; who will now dip into painting, 

and now study counterpoint, and anon will be inditing a sonnet:  

all these with equal interest, all often with genuine knowledge.  

And of this temper, when it stands alone, I find it difficult to 

speak; but I should counsel such an one to take to letters, for in 

literature (which drags with so wide a net) all his information may 

be found some day useful, and if he should go on as he has begun, 

and turn at last into the critic, he will have learned to use the 

necessary tools.  Lastly we come to those vocations which are at 

once decisive and precise; to the men who are born with the love of 

pigments, the passion of drawing, the gift of music, or the impulse 

to create with words, just as other and perhaps the same men are 

born with the love of hunting, or the sea, or horses, or the 

turning-lathe.  These are predestined; if a man love the labour of 

any trade, apart from any question of success or fame, the gods 

have called him.  He may have the general vocation too:  he may 

have a taste for all the arts, and I think he often has; but the 

mark of his calling is this laborious partiality for one, this 

inextinguishable zest in its technical successes, and (perhaps 

above all) a certain candour of mind to take his very trifling 

enterprise with a gravity that would befit the cares of empire, and 

to think the smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any 

expense of time and industry.  The book, the statue, the sonata, 

must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the 

unflagging spirit of children at their play.  IS IT WORTH DOING? - 

when it shall have occurred to any artist to ask himself that 

question, it is implicitly answered in the negative.  It does not 

occur to the child as he plays at being a pirate on the dining-room 

sofa, nor to the hunter as he pursues his quarry; and the candour 

of the one and the ardour of the other should be united in the 

bosom of the artist.



If you recognise in yourself some such decisive taste, there is no 

room for hesitation:  follow your bent.  And observe (lest I should 

too much discourage you) that the disposition does not usually burn 

so brightly at the first, or rather not so constantly.  Habit and 

practice sharpen gifts; the necessity of toil grows less 

disgusting, grows even welcome, in the course of years; a small 

taste (if it be only genuine) waxes with indulgence into an 

exclusive passion.  Enough, just now, if you can look back over a 

fair interval, and see that your chosen art has a little more than 

held its own among the thronging interests of youth.  Time will do 

the rest, if devotion help it; and soon your every thought will be 

engrossed in that beloved occupation.



But even with devotion, you may remind me, even with unfaltering 

and delighted industry, many thousand artists spend their lives, if 

the result be regarded, utterly in vain:  a thousand artists, and 

never one work of art.  But the vast mass of mankind are incapable 

of doing anything reasonably well, art among the rest.  The 

worthless artist would not improbably have been a quite incompetent 

baker.  And the artist, even if he does not amuse the public, 

amuses himself; so that there will always be one man the happier 

for his vigils.  This is the practical side of art:  its 

inexpugnable fortress for the true practitioner.  The direct 

returns - the wages of the trade are small, but the indirect - the 

wages of the life - are incalculably great.  No other business 

offers a man his daily bread upon such joyful terms.  The soldier 

and the explorer have moments of a worthier excitement, but they 

are purchased by cruel hardships and periods of tedium that beggar 

language.  In the life of the artist there need be no hour without 

its pleasure.  I take the author, with whose career I am best 

acquainted; and it is true he works in a rebellious material, and 

that the act of writing is cramped and trying both to the eyes and 

the temper; but remark him in his study, when matter crowds upon 

him and words are not wanting - in what a continual series of small 

successes time flows by; with what a sense of power as of one 

moving mountains, he marshals his petty characters; with what 

pleasures, both of the ear and eye, he sees his airy structure 

growing on the page; and how he labours in a craft to which the 

whole material of his life is tributary, and which opens a door to 

all his tastes, his loves, his hatreds, and his convictions, so 

that what he writes is only what he longed to utter.  He may have 

enjoyed many things in this big, tragic playground of the world; 

but what shall he have enjoyed more fully than a morning of 

successful work?  Suppose it ill paid:  the wonder is it should be 

paid at all.  Other men pay, and pay dearly, for pleasures less 

desirable.



Nor will the practice of art afford you pleasure only; it affords 

besides an admirable training.  For the artist works entirely upon 

honour.  The public knows little or nothing of those merits in the 

quest of which you are condemned to spend the bulk of your 

endeavours.  Merits of design, the merit of first-hand energy, the 

merit of a certain cheap accomplishment which a man of the artistic 

temper easily acquires - these they can recognise, and these they 

value.  But to those more exquisite refinements of proficiency and 

finish, which the artist so ardently desires and so keenly feels, 

for which (in the vigorous words of Balzac) he must toil "like a 

miner buried in a landslip," for which, day after day, he recasts 

and revises and rejects - the gross mass of the public must be ever 

blind.  To those lost pains, suppose you attain the highest pitch 

of merit, posterity may possibly do justice; suppose, as is so 

probable, you fall by even a hair's breadth of the highest, rest 

certain they shall never be observed.  Under the shadow of this 

cold thought, alone in his studio, the artist must preserve from 

day to day his constancy to the ideal.  It is this which makes his 

life noble; it is by this that the practice of his craft 

strengthens and matures his character; it is for this that even the 

serious countenance of the great emperor was turned approvingly (if 

only for a moment) on the followers of Apollo, and that sternly 

gentle voice bade the artist cherish his art.



And here there fall two warnings to be made.  First, if you are to 

continue to be a law to yourself, you must beware of the first 

signs of laziness.  This idealism in honesty can only be supported 

by perpetual effort; the standard is easily lowered, the artist who 

says "IT WILL DO," is on the downward path; three or four pot-

boilers are enough at times (above all at wrong times) to falsify a 

talent, and by the practice of journalism a man runs the risk of 

becoming wedded to cheap finish.  This is the danger on the one 

side; there is not less upon the other.  The consciousness of how 

much the artist is (and must be) a law to himself, debauches the 

small heads.  Perceiving recondite merits very hard to attain, 

making or swallowing artistic formulae, or perhaps falling in love 

with some particular proficiency of his own, many artists forget 

the end of all art:  to please.  It is doubtless tempting to 

exclaim against the ignorant bourgeois; yet it should not be 

forgotten, it is he who is to pay us, and that (surely on the face 

of it) for services that he shall desire to have performed.  Here 

also, if properly considered, there is a question of transcendental 

honesty.  To give the public what they do not want, and yet expect 

to be supported:  we have there a strange pretension, and yet not 

uncommon, above all with painters.  The first duty in this world is 

for a man to pay his way; when that is quite accomplished, he may 

plunge into what eccentricity he likes; but emphatically not till 

then.  Till then, he must pay assiduous court to the bourgeois who 

carries the purse.  And if in the course of these capitulations he 

shall falsify his talent, it can never have been a strong one, and 

he will have preserved a better thing than talent - character.  Or 

if he be of a mind so independent that he cannot stoop to this 

necessity, one course is yet open:  he can desist from art, and 

follow some more manly way of life.



I speak of a more manly way of life, it is a point on which I must 

be frank.  To live by a pleasure is not a high calling; it involves 

patronage, however veiled; it numbers the artist, however 

ambitious, along with dancing girls and billiard markers.  The 

French have a romantic evasion for one employment, and call its 

practitioners the Daughters of Joy.  The artist is of the same 

family, he is of the Sons of Joy, chose his trade to please 

himself, gains his livelihood by pleasing others, and has parted 

with something of the sterner dignity of man.  Journals but a 

little while ago declaimed against the Tennyson peerage; and this 

Son of Joy was blamed for condescension when he followed the 

example of Lord Lawrence and Lord Cairns and Lord Clyde.  The poet 

was more happily inspired; with a better modesty he accepted the 

honour; and anonymous journalists have not yet (if I am to believe 

them) recovered the vicarious disgrace to their profession.  When 

it comes to their turn, these gentlemen can do themselves more 

justice; and I shall be glad to think of it; for to my barbarian 

eyesight, even Lord Tennyson looks somewhat out of place in that 

assembly.  There should be no honours for the artist; he has 

already, in the practice of his art, more than his share of the 

rewards of life; the honours are pre-empted for other trades, less 

agreeable and perhaps more useful.



But the devil in these trades of pleasing is to fail to please.  In 

ordinary occupations, a man offers to do a certain thing or to 

produce a certain article with a merely conventional 

accomplishment, a design in which (we may almost say) it is 

difficult to fail.  But the artist steps forth out of the crowd and 

proposes to delight:  an impudent design, in which it is impossible 

to fail without odious circumstances.  The poor Daughter of Joy, 

carrying her smiles and finery quite unregarded through the crowd, 

makes a figure which it is impossible to recall without a wounding 

pity.  She is the type of the unsuccessful artist.  The actor, the 

dancer, and the singer must appear like her in person, and drain 

publicly the cup of failure.  But though the rest of us escape this 

crowning bitterness of the pillory, we all court in essence the 

same humiliation.  We all profess to be able to delight.  And how 

few of us are!  We all pledge ourselves to be able to continue to 

delight.  And the day will come to each, and even to the most 

admired, when the ardour shall have declined and the cunning shall 

be lost, and he shall sit by his deserted booth ashamed.  Then 

shall he see himself condemned to do work for which he blushes to 

take payment.  Then (as if his lot were not already cruel) he must 

lie exposed to the gibes of the wreckers of the press, who earn a 

little bitter bread by the condemnation of trash which they have 

not read, and the praise of excellence which they cannot 

understand.



And observe that this seems almost the necessary end at least of 

writers.  LES BLANCS ET LES BLEUS (for instance) is of an order of 

merit very different from LE VICOMTE DE BRAGLONNE; and if any 

gentleman can bear to spy upon the nakedness of CASTLE DANGEROUS, 

his name I think is Ham:  let it be enough for the rest of us to 

read of it (not without tears) in the pages of Lockhart.  Thus in 

old age, when occupation and comfort are most needful, the writer 

must lay aside at once his pastime and his breadwinner.  The 

painter indeed, if he succeed at all in engaging the attention of 

the public, gains great sums and can stand to his easel until a 

great age without dishonourable failure.  The writer has the double 

misfortune to be ill-paid while he can work, and to be incapable of 

working when he is old.  It is thus a way of life which conducts 

directly to a false position.



For the writer (in spite of notorious examples to the contrary) 

must look to be ill-paid.  Tennyson and Montepin make handsome 

livelihoods; but we cannot all hope to be Tennyson, and we do not 

all perhaps desire to be Montepin.  If you adopt an art to be your 

trade, weed your mind at the outset of all desire of money.  What 

you may decently expect, if you have some talent and much industry, 

is such an income as a clerk will earn with a tenth or perhaps a 

twentieth of your nervous output.  Nor have you the right to look 

for more; in the wages of the life, not in the wages of the trade, 

lies your reward; the work is here the wages.  It will be seen I 

have little sympathy with the common lamentations of the artist 

class.  Perhaps they do not remember the hire of the field 

labourer; or do they think no parallel will lie?  Perhaps they have 

never observed what is the retiring allowance of a field officer; 

or do they suppose their contributions to the arts of pleasing more 

important than the services of a colonel?  Perhaps they forget on 

how little Millet was content to live; or do they think, because 

they have less genius, they stand excused from the display of equal 

virtues?  But upon one point there should be no dubiety:  if a man 

be not frugal, he has no business in the arts.  If he be not 

frugal, he steers directly for that last tragic scene of LE VIEUX 

SALTIMBANQUE; if he be not frugal, he will find it hard to continue 

to be honest.  Some day, when the butcher is knocking at the door, 

he may be tempted, he may be obliged, to turn out and sell a 

slovenly piece of work.  If the obligation shall have arisen 

through no wantonness of his own, he is even to be commanded; for 

words cannot describe how far more necessary it is that a man 

should support his family, than that he should attain to - or 

preserve - distinction in the arts.  But if the pressure comes, 

through his own fault, he has stolen, and stolen under trust, and 

stolen (which is the worst of all) in such a way that no law can 

reach him.



And now you may perhaps ask me, if the debutant artist is to have 

no thought of money, and if (as is implied) he is to expect no 

honours from the State, he may not at least look forward to the 

delights of popularity?  Praise, you will tell me, is a savoury 

dish.  And in so far as you may mean the countenance of other 

artists you would put your finger on one of the most essential and 

enduring pleasures of the career of art.  But in so far as you 

should have an eye to the commendations of the public or the notice 

of the newspapers, be sure you would but be cherishing a dream.  It 

is true that in certain esoteric journals the author (for instance) 

is duly criticised, and that he is often praised a great deal more 

than he deserves, sometimes for qualities which he prided himself 

on eschewing, and sometimes by ladies and gentlemen who have denied 

themselves the privilege of reading his work.  But if a man be 

sensitive to this wild praise, we must suppose him equally alive to 

that which often accompanies and always follows it - wild ridicule.  

A man may have done well for years, and then he may fail; he will 

hear of his failure.  Or he may have done well for years, and still 

do well, but the critics may have tired of praising him, or there 

may have sprung up some new idol of the instant, some "dust a 

little gilt," to whom they now prefer to offer sacrifice.  Here is 

the obverse and the reverse of that empty and ugly thing called 

popularity.  Will any man suppose it worth the gaining?
