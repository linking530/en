	by Robert Louis Stevenson






Critic on the Hearth:



No one but myself knows what I have suffered, nor what my books

have gained, by your unsleeping watchfulness and admirable

pertinacity.  And now here is a volume that goes into the world and

lacks your IMPRIMATUR:  a strange thing in our joint lives; and the

reason of it stranger still! I have watched with interest, with

pain, and at length with amusement, your unavailing attempts to

peruse THE BLACK ARROW; and I think I should lack humour indeed, if

I let the occasion slip and did not place your name in the fly-leaf

of the only book of mine that you have never read - and never will

read.



That others may display more constancy is still my hope.  The tale

was written years ago for a particular audience and (I may say) in

rivalry with a particular author; I think I should do well to name

him, Mr. Alfred R. Phillips.  It was not without its reward at the

time.  I could not, indeed, displace Mr. Phillips from his well-won

priority; but in the eyes of readers who thought less than nothing

of TREASURE ISLAND, THE BLACK ARROW was supposed to mark a clear

advance.  Those who read volumes and those who read story papers

belong to different worlds.  The verdict on TREASURE ISLAND was

reversed in the other court; I wonder, will it be the same with its

successor?
