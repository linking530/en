by Laurence Sterne








To the Right Honourable Mr Pitt.



Sir,



Never poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his Dedication, than I

have from this of mine; for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom,

and in a retir'd thatch'd house, where I live in a constant endeavour to

fence against the infirmities of ill health, and other evils of life, by

mirth; being firmly persuaded that every time a man smiles,--but much more

so, when he laughs, it adds something to this Fragment of Life.



I humbly beg, Sir, that you will honour this book, by taking it--(not under

your Protection,--it must protect itself, but)--into the country with you;

where, if I am ever told, it has made you smile; or can conceive it has

beguiled you of one moment's pain--I shall think myself as happy as a

minister of state;--perhaps much happier than any one (one only excepted)

that I have read or heard of.



I am, Great Sir, (and, what is more to your Honour) I am, Good Sir, Your

Well-wisher, and most humble Fellow-subject,



The Author.
