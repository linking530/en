Volume the First






Chapter 1.I.



I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were

in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they

begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what they were

then doing;--that not only the production of a rational Being was concerned

in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body,

perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind;--and, for aught they knew

to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn

from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost;--Had they duly

weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly,--I am verily

persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from

that in which the reader is likely to see me.--Believe me, good folks, this

is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it;--you have

all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as how they are transfused

from father to son, &c. &c.--and a great deal to that purpose:--Well, you

may take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his nonsense,

his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and

activity, and the different tracks and trains you put them into, so that

when they are once set a-going, whether right or wrong, 'tis not a half-

penny matter,--away they go cluttering like hey-go mad; and by treading the

same steps over and over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain

and as smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the

Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.



Pray my Dear, quoth my mother, have you not forgot to wind up the clock?--

Good G..! cried my father, making an exclamation, but taking care to

moderate his voice at the same time,--Did ever woman, since the creation of

the world, interrupt a man with such a silly question?  Pray, what was your

father saying?--Nothing.





Chapter 1.II.



--Then, positively, there is nothing in the question that I can see, either

good or bad.--Then, let me tell you, Sir, it was a very unseasonable

question at least,--because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits,

whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand in hand with the

Homunculus, and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.



The Homunculus, Sir, in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear, in

this age of levity, to the eye of folly or prejudice;--to the eye of reason

in scientific research, he stands confessed--a Being guarded and

circumscribed with rights.--The minutest philosophers, who by the bye, have

the most enlarged understandings, (their souls being inversely as their

enquiries) shew us incontestably, that the Homunculus is created by the

same hand,--engendered in the same course of nature,--endow'd with the same

loco-motive powers and faculties with us:--That he consists as we do, of

skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartilages,

bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and articulations;--is a

Being of as much activity,--and in all senses of the word, as much and as

truly our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancellor of England.--He may be

benefitted,--he may be injured,--he may obtain redress; in a word, he has

all the claims and rights of humanity, which Tully, Puffendorf, or the best

ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and relation.



Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone!--or

that through terror of it, natural to so young a traveller, my little

Gentleman had got to his journey's end miserably spent;--his muscular

strength and virility worn down to a thread;--his own animal spirits

ruffled beyond description,--and that in this sad disorder'd state of

nerves, he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy

dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months together.--I tremble to

think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of

body and mind, which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could

ever afterwards have set thoroughly to rights. 





Chapter 1.III.



To my uncle Mr Toby Shandy do I stand indebted for the preceding anecdote,

to whom my father, who was an excellent natural philosopher, and much given

to close reasoning upon the smallest matters, had oft, and heavily

complained of the injury; but once more particularly, as my uncle Toby well

remember'd, upon his observing a most unaccountable obliquity, (as he

call'd it) in my manner of setting up my top, and justifying the principles

upon which I had done it,--the old gentleman shook his head, and in a tone

more expressive by half of sorrow than reproach,--he said his heart all

along foreboded, and he saw it verified in this, and from a thousand other

observations he had made upon me, That I should neither think nor act like

any other man's child:--But alas! continued he, shaking his head a second

time, and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his cheeks, My

Tristram's misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the

world.



--My mother, who was sitting by, look'd up, but she knew no more than her

backside what my father meant,--but my uncle, Mr. Toby Shandy, who had been

often informed of the affair,--understood him very well.





Chapter 1.IV.



I know there are readers in the world, as well as many other good people in

it, who are no readers at all,--who find themselves ill at ease, unless

they are let into the whole secret from first to last, of every thing which

concerns you.



It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs, and from a

backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living, that I have

been so very particular already.  As my life and opinions are likely to

make some noise in the world, and, if I conjecture right, will take in all

ranks, professions, and denominations of men whatever,--be no less read

than the Pilgrim's Progress itself--and in the end, prove the very thing

which Montaigne dreaded his Essays should turn out, that is, a book for a

parlour-window;--I find it necessary to consult every one a little in his

turn; and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little farther in the

same way:  For which cause, right glad I am, that I have begun the history

of myself in the way I have done; and that I am able to go on, tracing

every thing in it, as Horace says, ab Ovo.



Horace, I know, does not recommend this fashion altogether:  But that

gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedy;--(I forget which,)

besides, if it was not so, I should beg Mr Horace's pardon;--for in writing

what I have set about, I shall confine myself neither to his rules, nor to

any man's rules that ever lived.



To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these things, I can

give no better advice than that they skip over the remaining part of this

chapter; for I declare before-hand, 'tis wrote only for the curious and

inquisitive.



--Shut the door.--



I was begot in the night betwixt the first Sunday and the first Monday in

the month of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and

eighteen.  I am positive I was.--But how I came to be so very particular in

my account of a thing which happened before I was born, is owing to another

small anecdote known only in our own family, but now made publick for the

better clearing up this point.



My father, you must know, who was originally a Turkey merchant, but had

left off business for some years, in order to retire to, and die upon, his

paternal estate in the county of. . ., was, I believe, one of the most

regular men in every thing he did, whether 'twas matter of business, or

matter of amusement, that ever lived.  As a small specimen of this extreme

exactness of his, to which he was in truth a slave, he had made it a rule

for many years of his life,--on the first Sunday-night of every month

throughout the whole year,--as certain as ever the Sunday-night came,--to

wind up a large house-clock, which we had standing on the back-stairs head,

with his own hands:--And being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of

age at the time I have been speaking of,--he had likewise gradually brought

some other little family concernments to the same period, in order, as he

would often say to my uncle Toby, to get them all out of the way at one

time, and be no more plagued and pestered with them the rest of the month.



It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great measure, fell

upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall carry with me to my

grave; namely, that from an unhappy association of ideas, which have no

connection in nature, it so fell out at length, that my poor mother could

never hear the said clock wound up,--but the thoughts of some other things

unavoidably popped into her head--& vice versa:--Which strange combination

of ideas, the sagacious Locke, who certainly understood the nature of these

things better than most men, affirms to have produced more wry actions than

all other sources of prejudice whatsoever.



But this by the bye.



Now it appears by a memorandum in my father's pocket-book, which now lies

upon the table, 'That on Lady-day, which was on the 25th of the same month

in which I date my geniture,--my father set upon his journey to London,

with my eldest brother Bobby, to fix him at Westminster school;' and, as it

appears from the same authority, 'That he did not get down to his wife and

family till the second week in May following,'--it brings the thing almost

to a certainty.  However, what follows in the beginning of the next

chapter, puts it beyond all possibility of a doubt.



--But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all December, January, and

February?--Why, Madam,--he was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica. 





Chapter 1.V.



On the fifth day of November, 1718, which to the aera fixed on, was as near

nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have expected,--was I

Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, brought forth into this scurvy and disastrous

world of ours.--I wish I had been born in the Moon, or in any of the

planets, (except Jupiter or Saturn, because I never could bear cold

weather) for it could not well have fared worse with me in any of them

(though I will not answer for Venus) than it has in this vile, dirty planet

of ours,--which, o' my conscience, with reverence be it spoken, I take to

be made up of the shreds and clippings of the rest;--not but the planet is

well enough, provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a

great estate; or could any how contrive to be called up to public charges,

and employments of dignity or power;--but that is not my case;--and

therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in

it;--for which cause I affirm it over again to be one of the vilest worlds

that ever was made;--for I can truly say, that from the first hour I drew

my breath in it, to this, that I can now scarce draw it at all, for an

asthma I got in scating against the wind in Flanders;--I have been the

continual sport of what the world calls Fortune; and though I will not

wrong her by saying, She has ever made me feel the weight of any great or

signal evil;--yet with all the good temper in the world I affirm it of her,

that in every stage of my life, and at every turn and corner where she

could get fairly at me, the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of

as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero sustained.





Chapter 1.VI.



In the beginning of the last chapter, I informed you exactly when I was

born; but I did not inform you how.  No, that particular was reserved

entirely for a chapter by itself;--besides, Sir, as you and I are in a

manner perfect strangers to each other, it would not have been proper to

have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at once.



--You must have a little patience.  I have undertaken, you see, to write

not only my life, but my opinions also; hoping and expecting that your

knowledge of my character, and of what kind of a mortal I am, by the one,

would give you a better relish for the other:  As you proceed farther with

me, the slight acquaintance, which is now beginning betwixt us, will grow

into familiarity; and that unless one of us is in fault, will terminate in

friendship.--O diem praeclarum!--then nothing which has touched me will be

thought trifling in its nature, or tedious in its telling.  Therefore, my

dear friend and companion, if you should think me somewhat sparing of my

narrative on my first setting out--bear with me,--and let me go on, and

tell my story my own way:--Or, if I should seem now and then to trifle upon

the road,--or should sometimes put on a fool's cap with a bell to it, for a

moment or two as we pass along,--don't fly off,--but rather courteously

give me credit for a little more wisdom than appears upon my outside;--and

as we jog on, either laugh with me, or at me, or in short do any thing,--

only keep your temper.





Chapter 1.VII.



In the same village where my father and my mother dwelt, dwelt also a thin,

upright, motherly, notable, good old body of a midwife, who with the help

of a little plain good sense, and some years full employment in her

business, in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts, and

a great deal to those of dame Nature,--had acquired, in her way, no small

degree of reputation in the world:--by which word world, need I in this

place inform your worship, that I would be understood to mean no more of

it, than a small circle described upon the circle of the great world, of

four English miles diameter, or thereabouts, of which the cottage where the

good old woman lived is supposed to be the centre?--She had been left it

seems a widow in great distress, with three or four small children, in her

forty-seventh year; and as she was at that time a person of decent

carriage,--grave deportment,--a woman moreover of few words and withal an

object of compassion, whose distress, and silence under it, called out the

louder for a friendly lift:  the wife of the parson of the parish was

touched with pity; and having often lamented an inconvenience to which her

husband's flock had for many years been exposed, inasmuch as there was no

such thing as a midwife, of any kind or degree, to be got at, let the case

have been never so urgent, within less than six or seven long miles riding;

which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads, the country

thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay, was almost equal to fourteen;

and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all; it came

into her head, that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole

parish, as to the poor creature herself, to get her a little instructed in

some of the plain principles of the business, in order to set her up in it. 

As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she had

formed than herself, the gentlewoman very charitably undertook it; and

having great influence over the female part of the parish, she found no

difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes.  In truth, the

parson join'd his interest with his wife's in the whole affair, and in

order to do things as they should be, and give the poor soul as good a

title by law to practise, as his wife had given by institution,--he

cheerfully paid the fees for the ordinary's licence himself, amounting in

the whole, to the sum of eighteen shillings and four pence; so that betwixt

them both, the good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal

possession of her office, together with all its rights, members, and

appurtenances whatsoever.



These last words, you must know, were not according to the old form in

which such licences, faculties, and powers usually ran, which in like cases

had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood.  But it was according to a

neat Formula of Didius his own devising, who having a particular turn for

taking to pieces, and new framing over again all kind of instruments in

that way, not only hit upon this dainty amendment, but coaxed many of the

old licensed matrons in the neighbourhood, to open their faculties afresh,

in order to have this wham-wham of his inserted. 



I own I never could envy Didius in these kinds of fancies of his:--But

every man to his own taste.--Did not Dr Kunastrokius, that great man, at

his leisure hours, take the greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses

tails, and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth, though he had

tweezers always in his pocket?  Nay, if you come to that, Sir, have not the

wisest of men in all ages, not excepting Solomon himself,--have they not

had their Hobby-Horses;--their running horses,--their coins and their

cockle-shells, their drums and their trumpets, their fiddles, their

pallets,--their maggots and their butterflies?--and so long as a man rides

his Hobby-Horse peaceably and quietly along the King's highway, and neither

compels you or me to get up behind him,--pray, Sir, what have either you or

I to do with it?





Chapter 1.VIII.



--De gustibus non est disputandum;--that is, there is no disputing against

Hobby-Horses; and for my part, I seldom do; nor could I with any sort of

grace, had I been an enemy to them at the bottom; for happening, at certain

intervals and changes of the moon, to be both fidler and painter, according

as the fly stings:--Be it known to you, that I keep a couple of pads

myself, upon which, in their turns, (nor do I care who knows it) I

frequently ride out and take the air;--though sometimes, to my shame be it

spoken, I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think

altogether right.--But the truth is,--I am not a wise man;--and besides am

a mortal of so little consequence in the world, it is not much matter what

I do:  so I seldom fret or fume at all about it:  Nor does it much disturb

my rest, when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as hereafter

follow;--such, for instance, as my Lord A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M,

N, O, P, Q, and so on, all of a row, mounted upon their several horses,--

some with large stirrups, getting on in a more grave and sober pace;--

others on the contrary, tucked up to their very chins, with whips across

their mouths, scouring and scampering it away like so many little party-

coloured devils astride a mortgage,--and as if some of them were resolved

to break their necks.--So much the better--say I to myself;--for in case

the worst should happen, the world will make a shift to do excellently well

without them; and for the rest,--why--God speed them--e'en let them ride on

without opposition from me; for were their lordships unhorsed this very

night--'tis ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one

half before tomorrow morning.



Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my rest.-

-But there is an instance, which I own puts me off my guard, and that is,

when I see one born for great actions, and what is still more for his

honour, whose nature ever inclines him to good ones;--when I behold such a

one, my Lord, like yourself, whose principles and conduct are as generous

and noble as his blood, and whom, for that reason, a corrupt world cannot

spare one moment;--when I see such a one, my Lord, mounted, though it is

but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed

to him, and my zeal for his glory wishes,--then, my Lord, I cease to be a

philosopher, and in the first transport of an honest impatience, I wish the

Hobby-Horse, with all his fraternity, at the Devil.





'My Lord,

I maintain this to be a dedication, notwithstanding its singularity in the

three great essentials of matter, form and place:  I beg, therefore, you

will accept it as such, and that you will permit me to lay it, with the

most respectful humility, at your Lordship's feet--when you are upon them,-

-which you can be when you please;--and that is, my Lord, whenever there is

occasion for it, and I will add, to the best purposes too.  I have the

honour to be, 

My Lord, 

Your Lordship's most obedient,

and most devoted,

and most humble servant,

Tristram Shandy.'





Chapter 1.IX.



I solemnly declare to all mankind, that the above dedication was made for

no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or Potentate,--Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount,

or Baron, of this, or any other Realm in Christendom;--nor has it yet been

hawked about, or offered publicly or privately, directly or indirectly, to

any one person or personage, great or small; but is honestly a true Virgin-

Dedication untried on, upon any soul living. 



I labour this point so particularly, merely to remove any offence or

objection which might arise against it from the manner in which I propose

to make the most of it;--which is the putting it up fairly to public sale;

which I now do.



--Every author has a way of his own in bringing his points to bear;--for my

own part, as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark

entry;--I resolved within myself, from the very beginning, to deal squarely

and openly with your Great Folks in this affair, and try whether I should

not come off the better by it.



If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, in

these his Majesty's dominions, who stands in need of a tight, genteel

dedication, and whom the above will suit, (for by the bye, unless it suits

in some degree, I will not part with it)--it is much at his service for

fifty guineas;--which I am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to

be afforded for, by any man of genius.



My Lord, if you examine it over again, it is far from being a gross piece

of daubing, as some dedications are.  The design, your Lordship sees, is

good,--the colouring transparent,--the drawing not amiss;--or to speak more

like a man of science,--and measure my piece in the painter's scale,

divided into 20,--I believe, my Lord, the outlines will turn out as 12,--

the composition as 9,--the colouring as 6,--the expression 13 and a half,--

and the design,--if I may be allowed, my Lord, to understand my own design,

and supposing absolute perfection in designing, to be as 20,--I think it

cannot well fall short of 19.  Besides all this,--there is keeping in it,

and the dark strokes in the Hobby-Horse, (which is a secondary figure, and

a kind of back-ground to the whole) give great force to the principal

lights in your own figure, and make it come off wonderfully;--and besides,

there is an air of originality in the tout ensemble.



Be pleased, my good Lord, to order the sum to be paid into the hands of Mr.

Dodsley, for the benefit of the author; and in the next edition care shall

be taken that this chapter be expunged, and your Lordship's titles,

distinctions, arms, and good actions, be placed at the front of the

preceding chapter:  All which, from the words, De gustibus non est

disputandum, and whatever else in this book relates to Hobby-Horses, but no

more, shall stand dedicated to your Lordship.--The rest I dedicate to the

Moon, who, by the bye, of all the Patrons or Matrons I can think of, has

most power to set my book a-going, and make the world run mad after it.



Bright Goddess,

If thou art not too busy with Candid and Miss Cunegund's affairs,--take

Tristram Shandy's under thy protection also.





Chapter 1.X.



Whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the

midwife might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly rested,--at first

sight seems not very material to this history;--certain however it was,

that the gentlewoman, the parson's wife, did run away at that time with the

whole of it:  And yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking but that the

parson himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design

first,--yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before

him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution, had

a claim to some share of it,--if not to a full half of whatever honour was

due to it.



The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise.



Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a probable guess

at the grounds of this procedure.



Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of the

midwife's licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an account,--the

parson we have to do with had made himself a country-talk by a breach of

all decorum, which he had committed against himself, his station, and his

office;--and that was in never appearing better, or otherwise mounted, than

upon a lean, sorry, jackass of a horse, value about one pound fifteen

shillings; who, to shorten all description of him, was full brother to

Rosinante, as far as similitude congenial could make him; for he answered

his description to a hair-breadth in every thing,--except that I do not

remember 'tis any where said, that Rosinante was broken-winded; and that,

moreover, Rosinante, as is the happiness of most Spanish horses, fat or

lean,--was undoubtedly a horse at all points.



I know very well that the Hero's horse was a horse of chaste deportment,

which may have given grounds for the contrary opinion:  But it is as

certain at the same time that Rosinante's continency (as may be

demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesian carriers) proceeded from

no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but from the temperance and orderly

current of his blood.--And let me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of

very good chastity in the world, in behalf of which you could not say more

for your life.



Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do exact justice to every

creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work,--I could not stifle

this distinction in favour of Don Quixote's horse;--in all other points,

the parson's horse, I say, was just such another, for he was as lean, and

as lank, and as sorry a jade, as Humility herself could have bestrided.



In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it was greatly

in the parson's power to have helped the figure of this horse of his,--for

he was master of a very handsome demi-peaked saddle, quilted on the seat

with green plush, garnished with a double row of silver-headed studs, and a

noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a housing altogether suitable,

of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of black lace, terminating in a

deep, black, silk fringe, poudre d'or,--all which he had purchased in the

pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed bridle,

ornamented at all points as it should be.--But not caring to banter his

beast, he had hung all these up behind his study door:  and, in lieu of

them, had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle,

as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve.



In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring visits to

the gentry who lived around him,--you will easily comprehend, that the

parson, so appointed, would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy

from rusting.  To speak the truth, he never could enter a village, but he

caught the attention of both old and young.--Labour stood still as he

pass'd--the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well,--the spinning-

wheel forgot its round,--even chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves

stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as his movement was not of

the quickest, he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his

observations,--to hear the groans of the serious,--and the laughter of the

light-hearted; all which he bore with excellent tranquillity.--His

character was,--he loved a jest in his heart--and as he saw himself in the

true point of ridicule, he would say he could not be angry with others for

seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself:  So that to his

friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money, and who therefore

made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour,--instead

of giving the true cause,--he chose rather to join in the laugh against

himself; and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own

bones, being altogether as spare a figure as his beast,--he would sometimes

insist upon it, that the horse was as good as the rider deserved;--that

they were, centaur-like,--both of a piece.  At other times, and in other

moods, when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit,--he would

say, he found himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great

gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse, without

a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and that he

had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to keep himself in

countenance, but in spirits.



At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons for

riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse, preferably to one of

mettle;--for on such a one he could fit mechanically, and meditate as

delightfully de vanitate mundi et fuga faeculi, as with the advantage of a

death's-head before him;--that, in all other exercitations, he could spend

his time, as he rode slowly along,--to as much account as in his study;--

that he could draw up an argument in his sermon,--or a hole in his

breeches, as steadily on the one as in the other;--that brisk trotting and

slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible

movements.--But that upon his steed--he could unite and reconcile every

thing,--he could compose his sermon--he could compose his cough,--and, in

case nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to

sleep.--In short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause

but the true cause,--and he with-held the true one, only out of a nicety of

temper, because he thought it did honour to him.



But the truth of the story was as follows:  In the first years of this

gentleman's life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were

purchased by him, it had been his manner, or vanity, or call it what you

will,--to run into the opposite extreme.--In the language of the county

where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good horse, and generally had

one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for

saddling: and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to

the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,--it so fell out that

the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous

application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and

every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last;--as much

as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of

which was generally this; that his horse was either clapp'd, or spavin'd,

or greaz'd;--or he was twitter-bon'd, or broken-winded, or something, in

short, or other had befallen him, which would let him carry no flesh;--so

that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,--and a good

horse to purchase in his stead.



What the loss in such a balance might amount to, communibus annis, I would

leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;--

but let it be what it would, the honest gentleman bore it for many years

without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he

found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing

the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only

disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in

itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: 

Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he

could do ten times as much good;--and what still weighed more with him than

all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his

charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the

least wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his

parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,--nothing for the aged,--nothing

for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where

poverty, and sickness and affliction dwelt together. 



For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there

appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;--and

these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his

steed upon any application whatever,--or else be content to ride the last

poor devil, such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities,

to the very end of the chapter.



As he dreaded his own constancy in the first--he very chearfully betook

himself to the second; and though he could very well have explained it, as

I said, to his honour,--yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above

it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter

of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem

a panegyrick upon himself.



I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this

reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think

comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of La

Mancha, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I love more, and would

actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero

of antiquity.



But this is not the moral of my story:  The thing I had in view was to shew

the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.--For you must know,

that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit,--the

devil a soul could find it out,--I suppose his enemies would not, and that

his friends could not.--But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of

the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary's licence to set her up,-

-but the whole secret came out; every horse he had lost, and two horses

more than ever he had lost, with all the circumstances of their

destruction, were known and distinctly remembered.--The story ran like

wild-fire.--'The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized

him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if it

was so, 'twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he would pocket the expence of

the licence ten times told, the very first year:--So that every body was

left to judge what were his views in this act of charity.'



What were his views in this, and in every other action of his life,--or

rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people

concerning it, was a thought which too much floated in his own, and too

often broke in upon his rest, when he should have been sound asleep.



About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely

easy upon that score,--it being just so long since he left his parish,--and

the whole world at the same time behind him,--and stands accountable to a

Judge of whom he will have no cause to complain.



But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men:  Order them as

they will, they pass thro' a certain medium, which so twists and refracts

them from their true directions--that, with all the titles to praise which

a rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are nevertheless forced to

live and die without it.



Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful example.--But to know

by what means this came to pass,--and to make that knowledge of use to you,

I insist upon it that you read the two following chapters, which contain

such a sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along

with it.--When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way, we will go on

with the midwife.





Chapter 1.XI.



Yorick was this parson's name, and, what is very remarkable in it, (as

appears from a most ancient account of the family, wrote upon strong

vellum, and now in perfect preservation) it had been exactly so spelt for

near,--I was within an ace of saying nine hundred years;--but I would not

shake my credit in telling an improbable truth, however indisputable in

itself,--and therefore I shall content myself with only saying--It had been

exactly so spelt, without the least variation or transposition of a single

letter, for I do not know how long; which is more than I would venture to

say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom; which, in a course of

years, have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their owners.-

-Has this been owing to the pride, or to the shame of the respective

proprietors?--In honest truth, I think sometimes to the one, and sometimes

to the other, just as the temptation has wrought.  But a villainous affair

it is, and will one day so blend and confound us all together, that no one

shall be able to stand up and swear, 'That his own great grandfather was

the man who did either this or that.'



This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the

Yorick's family, and their religious preservation of these records I quote,

which do farther inform us, That the family was originally of Danish

extraction, and had been transplanted into England as early as in the reign

of Horwendillus, king of Denmark, in whose court, it seems, an ancestor of

this Mr Yorick's, and from whom he was lineally descended, held a

considerable post to the day of his death.  Of what nature this

considerable post was, this record saith not;--it only adds, That, for near

two centuries, it had been totally abolished, as altogether unnecessary,

not only in that court, but in every other court of the Christian world.



It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than that

of the king's chief Jester;--and that Hamlet's Yorick, in our Shakespeare,

many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated facts, was

certainly the very man.



I have not the time to look into Saxo-Grammaticus's Danish history, to know

the certainty of this;--but if you have leisure, and can easily get at the

book, you may do it full as well yourself.



I had just time, in my travels through Denmark with Mr. Noddy's eldest son,

whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied as governor, riding along with him at

a prodigious rate thro' most parts of Europe, and of which original journey

performed by us two, a most delectable narrative will be given in the

progress of this work.  I had just time, I say, and that was all, to prove

the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country;--

namely, 'That nature was neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in

her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants;--but, like a discreet

parent, was moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in

the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty

near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with few instances

in that kingdom of refined parts; but a great deal of good plain houshold

understanding amongst all ranks of people, of which every body has a

share;' which is, I think, very right.



With us, you see, the case is quite different:--we are all ups and downs in

this matter;--you are a great genius;--or 'tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a

great dunce and a blockhead;--not that there is a total want of

intermediate steps,--no,--we are not so irregular as that comes to;--but

the two extremes are more common, and in a greater degree in this unsettled

island, where nature, in her gifts and dispositions of this kind, is most

whimsical and capricious; fortune herself not being more so in the bequest

of her goods and chattels than she.



This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to Yorick's extraction,

who, by what I can remember of him, and by all the accounts I could ever

get of him, seemed not to have had one single drop of Danish blood in his

whole crasis; in nine hundred years, it might possibly have all run out:--I

will not philosophize one moment with you about it; for happen how it

would, the fact was this:--That instead of that cold phlegm and exact

regularity of sense and humours, you would have looked for, in one so

extracted;--he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and sublimated a

composition,--as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions;--with as

much life and whim, and gaite de coeur about him, as the kindliest climate

could have engendered and put together.  With all this sail, poor Yorick

carried not one ounce of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world;

and at the age of twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his

course in it, as a romping, unsuspicious girl of thirteen:  So that upon

his first setting out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine,

ran him foul ten times in a day of somebody's tackling; and as the grave

and more slow-paced were oftenest in his way,--you may likewise imagine,

'twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled. 

For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom

of such Fracas:--For, to speak the truth, Yorick had an invincible dislike

and opposition in his nature to gravity;--not to gravity as such;--for

where gravity was wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal

men for days and weeks together;--but he was an enemy to the affectation of

it, and declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for

ignorance, or for folly:  and then, whenever it fell in his way, however

sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much quarter.



Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say, that Gravity was an

errant scoundrel, and he would add,--of the most dangerous kind too,--

because a sly one; and that he verily believed, more honest, well-meaning

people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month,

than by pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven.  In the naked temper

which a merry heart discovered, he would say there was no danger,--but to

itself:--whereas the very essence of gravity was design, and consequently

deceit;--'twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense

and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,--it

was no better, but often worse, than what a French wit had long ago defined

it,--viz. 'A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the

mind;'--which definition of gravity, Yorick, with great imprudence, would

say, deserved to be wrote in letters of gold.



But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world,

and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of

discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint.  Yorick had no

impression but one, and that was what arose from the nature of the deed

spoken of; which impression he would usually translate into plain English

without any periphrasis;--and too oft without much distinction of either

person, time, or place;--so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an

ungenerous proceeding--he never gave himself a moment's time to reflect who

was the hero of the piece,--what his station,--or how far he had power to

hurt him hereafter;--but if it was a dirty action,--without more ado,--The

man was a dirty fellow,--and so on.--And as his comments had usually the

ill fate to be terminated either in a bon mot, or to be enlivened

throughout with some drollery or humour of expression, it gave wings to

Yorick's indiscretion.  In a word, tho' he never sought, yet, at the same

time, as he seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and

without much ceremony;--he had but too many temptations in life, of

scattering his wit and his humour,--his gibes and his jests about him.--

They were not lost for want of gathering.



What were the consequences, and what was Yorick's catastrophe thereupon,

you will read in the next chapter.





Chapter 1.XII.



The Mortgager and Mortgagee differ the one from the other, not more in

length of purse, than the Jester and Jestee do, in that of memory.  But in

this the comparison between them runs, as the scholiasts call it, upon all-

four; which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more than some of the best

of Homer's can pretend to;--namely, That the one raises a sum, and the

other a laugh at your expence, and thinks no more about it.  Interest,

however, still runs on in both cases;--the periodical or accidental

payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive; till,

at length, in some evil hour, pop comes the creditor upon each, and by

demanding principal upon the spot, together with full interest to the very

day, makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations.



As the reader (for I hate your ifs) has a thorough knowledge of human

nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my Hero could not go on at

this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos.  To

speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small

book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding Eugenius's frequent

advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was

contracted thro' any malignancy;--but, on the contrary, from an honesty of

mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cross'd out

in course.



Eugenius would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day or

other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add, in an

accent of sorrowful apprehension,--to the uttermost mite.  To which Yorick,

with his usual carelessness of heart, would as often answer with a pshaw!--

and if the subject was started in the fields,--with a hop, skip, and a jump

at the end of it; but if close pent up in the social chimney-corner, where

the culprit was barricado'd in, with a table and a couple of arm-chairs,

and could not so readily fly off in a tangent,--Eugenius would then go on

with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose, though somewhat

better put together.



Trust me, dear Yorick, this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later

bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no after-wit can extricate

thee out of.--In these sallies, too oft, I see, it happens, that a person

laughed at, considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all

the rights of such a situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest him

in that light too, and reckons up his friends, his family, his kindred and

allies,--and musters up with them the many recruits which will list under

him from a sense of common danger;--'tis no extravagant arithmetic to say,

that for every ten jokes,--thou hast got an hundred enemies; and till thou

hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half

stung to death by them, thou wilt never be convinced it is so.



I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the least spur

from spleen or malevolence of intent in these sallies--I believe and know

them to be truly honest and sportive:--But consider, my dear lad, that

fools cannot distinguish this,--and that knaves will not:  and thou knowest

not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with the

other:--whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend upon it, they

will carry on the war in such a manner against thee, my dear friend, as to

make thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life too.



Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at thee,

which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set right.--The

fortunes of thy house shall totter,--thy character, which led the way to

them, shall bleed on every side of it,--thy faith questioned,--thy works

belied,--thy wit forgotten,--thy learning trampled on.  To wind up the last

scene of thy tragedy, Cruelty and Cowardice, twin ruffians, hired and set

on by Malice in the dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities and

mistakes:--The best of us, my dear lad, lie open there,--and trust me,--

trust me, Yorick, when to gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved

upon, that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, 'tis

an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has

strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with.



Yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to

him, but with a tear stealing from his eye, and a promissory look attending

it, that he was resolved, for the time to come, to ride his tit with more

sobriety.--But, alas, too late!--a grand confederacy with. . .and. . .at

the head of it, was formed before the first prediction of it.--The whole

plan of the attack, just as Eugenius had foreboded, was put in execution

all at once,--with so little mercy on the side of the allies,--and so

little suspicion in Yorick, of what was carrying on against him,--that when

he thought, good easy man! full surely preferment was o'ripening,--they had

smote his root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before

him.



Yorick, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time;

till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by the calamities of

the war,--but more so, by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried

on,--he threw down the sword; and though he kept up his spirits in

appearance to the last, he died, nevertheless, as was generally thought,

quite broken-hearted.



What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion was as follows:



A few hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius stept in with an

intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him.  Upon his drawing

Yorick's curtain, and asking how he felt himself, Yorick looking up in his

face took hold of his hand,--and after thanking him for the many tokens of

his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet

hereafter,--he would thank him again and again,--he told him, he was within

a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever.--I hope not, answered

Eugenius, with tears trickling down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone

that ever man spoke.--I hope not, Yorick, said he.--Yorick replied, with a

look up, and a gentle squeeze of Eugenius's hand, and that was all,--but it

cut Eugenius to his heart.--Come,--come, Yorick, quoth Eugenius, wiping his

eyes, and summoning up the man within him,--my dear lad, be comforted,--let

not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou

most wants them;--who knows what resources are in store, and what the power

of God may yet do for thee!--Yorick laid his hand upon his heart, and

gently shook his head;--For my part, continued Eugenius, crying bitterly as

he uttered the words,--I declare I know not, Yorick, how to part with thee,

and would gladly flatter my hopes, added Eugenius, chearing up his voice,

that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop, and that I may

live to see it.--I beseech thee, Eugenius, quoth Yorick, taking off his

night-cap as well as he could with his left hand,--his right being still

grasped close in that of Eugenius,--I beseech thee to take a view of my

head.--I see nothing that ails it, replied Eugenius.  Then, alas! my

friend, said Yorick, let me tell you, that 'tis so bruised and mis-shapened

with the blows which. . .and. . ., and some others have so unhandsomely

given me in the dark, that I might say with Sancho Panca, that should I

recover, and 'Mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as

thick as hail, not one of them would fit it.'--Yorick's last breath was

hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this:--yet

still it was uttered with something of a Cervantick tone;--and as he spoke

it, Eugenius could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a

moment in his eyes;--faint picture of those flashes of his spirit, which

(as Shakespeare said of his ancestor) were wont to set the table in a roar!



Eugenius was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend was broke: 

he squeezed his hand,--and then walked softly out of the room, weeping as

he walked.  Yorick followed Eugenius with his eyes to the door,--he then

closed them, and never opened them more.



He lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish of. . .,

under a plain marble slab, which his friend Eugenius, by leave of his

executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than these three words of

inscription, serving both for his epitaph and elegy.  Alas, poor Yorick!



Ten times a day has Yorick's ghost the consolation to hear his monumental

inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones, as denote a

general pity and esteem for him;--a foot-way crossing the church-yard close

by the side of his grave,--not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast

a look upon it,--and sighing as he walks on, Alas, poor Yorick!





Chapter 1.XIII.



It is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted

from the midwife, that it is high time to mention her again to him, merely

to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world, and whom,

upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present, I am going

to introduce to him for good and all:  But as fresh matter may be started,

and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself, which

may require immediate dispatch;--'twas right to take care that the poor

woman should not be lost in the mean time;--because when she is wanted, we

can no way do without her.



I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and

consequence throughout our whole village and township;--that her fame had

spread itself to the very out-edge and circumference of that circle of

importance, of which kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his

back or no,--has one surrounding him;--which said circle, by the way,

whenever 'tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the

world,--I desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worship's fancy, in

a compound ratio of the station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height

and depth (measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.



In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or five miles,

which not only comprehended the whole parish, but extended itself to two or

three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish; which made

a considerable thing of it.  I must add, That she was, moreover, very well

looked on at one large grange-house, and some other odd houses and farms

within two or three miles, as I said, from the smoke of her own chimney:--

But I must here, once for all, inform you, that all this will be more

exactly delineated and explain'd in a map, now in the hands of the

engraver, which, with many other pieces and developements of this work,

will be added to the end of the twentieth volume,--not to swell the work,--

I detest the thought of such a thing;--but by way of commentary, scholium,

illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or inuendos as shall be

thought to be either of private interpretation, or of dark or doubtful

meaning, after my life and my opinions shall have been read over (now don't 

forget the meaning of the word) by all the world;--which, betwixt you and

me, and in spite of all the gentlemen-reviewers in Great Britain, and of

all that their worships shall undertake to write or say to the contrary,--I

am determined shall be the case.--I need not tell your worship, that all

this is spoke in confidence.





Chapter 1.XIV.



Upon looking into my mother's marriage settlement, in order to satisfy

myself and reader in a point necessary to be cleared up, before we could

proceed any farther in this history;--I had the good fortune to pop upon

the very thing I wanted before I had read a day and a half straight

forwards,--it might have taken me up a month;--which shews plainly, that

when a man sits down to write a history,--tho' it be but the history of

Jack Hickathrift or Tom Thumb, he knows no more than his heels what lets

and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way,--or what a dance

he may be led, by one excursion or another, before all is over.  Could a

historiographer drive on his history, as a muleteer drives on his mule,--

straight forward;--for instance, from Rome all the way to Loretto, without

ever once turning his head aside, either to the right hand or to the left,-

-he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he should get to his

journey's end;--but the thing is, morally speaking, impossible:  For, if he

is a man of the least spirit, he will have fifty deviations from a straight

line to make with this or that party as he goes along, which he can no ways

avoid.  He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting

his eye, which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can

fly; he will moreover have various 

Accounts to reconcile:  

Anecdotes to pick up:  

Inscriptions to make out:  

Stories to weave in:  

Traditions to sift:  

Personages to call upon:  

Panegyricks to paste up at this door;  

Pasquinades at that:--All which both the man and his mule are quite exempt

from.  To sum up all; there are archives at every stage to be look'd into,

and rolls, records, documents, and endless genealogies, which justice ever

and anon calls him back to stay the reading of:--In short there is no end

of it;--for my own part, I declare I have been at it these six weeks,

making all the speed I possibly could,--and am not yet born:--I have just

been able, and that's all, to tell you when it happen'd, but not how;--so

that you see the thing is yet far from being accomplished.



These unforeseen stoppages, which I own I had no conception of when I first

set out;--but which, I am convinced now, will rather increase than diminish

as I advance,--have struck out a hint which I am resolved to follow;--and

that is,--not to be in a hurry;--but to go on leisurely, writing and

publishing two volumes of my life every year;--which, if I am suffered to

go on quietly, and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller, I shall

continue to do as long as I live.





Chapter 1.XV.



The article in my mother's marriage-settlement, which I told the reader I

was at the pains to search for, and which, now that I have found it, I

think proper to lay before him,--is so much more fully express'd in the

deed itself, than ever I can pretend to do it, that it would be barbarity

to take it out of the lawyer's hand:--It is as follows.



'And this Indenture further witnesseth, That the said Walter Shandy,

merchant, in consideration of the said intended marriage to be had, and, by

God's blessing, to be well and truly solemnized and consummated between the

said Walter Shandy and Elizabeth Mollineux aforesaid, and divers other good

and valuable causes and considerations him thereunto specially moving,--

doth grant, covenant, condescend, consent, conclude, bargain, and fully

agree to and with John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. the above-named

Trustees, &c. &c.--to wit,--That in case it should hereafter so fall out,

chance, happen, or otherwise come to pass,--That the said Walter Shandy,

merchant, shall have left off business before the time or times, that the

said Elizabeth Mollineux shall, according to the course of nature, or

otherwise, have left off bearing and bringing forth children;--and that, in

consequence of the said Walter Shandy having so left off business, he shall

in despight, and against the free-will, consent, and good-liking of the

said Elizabeth Mollineux,--make a departure from the city of London, in

order to retire to, and dwell upon, his estate at Shandy Hall, in the

county of. . ., or at any other country-seat, castle, hall, mansion-house,

messuage or grainge-house, now purchased, or hereafter to be purchased, or

upon any part or parcel thereof:--That then, and as often as the said

Elizabeth Mollineux shall happen to be enceint with child or children

severally and lawfully begot, or to be begotten, upon the body of the said

Elizabeth Mollineux, during her said coverture,--he the said Walter Shandy

shall, at his own proper cost and charges, and out of his own proper

monies, upon good and reasonable notice, which is hereby agreed to be

within six weeks of her the said Elizabeth Mollineux's full reckoning, or

time of supposed and computed delivery,--pay, or cause to be paid, the sum

of one hundred and twenty pounds of good and lawful money, to John Dixon,

and James Turner, Esqrs. or assigns,--upon Trust and confidence, and for

and unto the use and uses, intent, end, and purpose following:--That is to

say,--That the said sum of one hundred and twenty pounds shall be paid into

the hands of the said Elizabeth Mollineux, or to be otherwise applied by

them the said Trustees, for the well and truly hiring of one coach, with

able and sufficient horses, to carry and convey the body of the said

Elizabeth Mollineux, and the child or children which she shall be then and

there enceint and pregnant with,--unto the city of London; and for the

further paying and defraying of all other incidental costs, charges, and

expences whatsoever,--in and about, and for, and relating to, her said

intended delivery and lying-in, in the said city or suburbs thereof.  And

that the said Elizabeth Mollineux shall and may, from time to time, and at

all such time and times as are here covenanted and agreed upon,--peaceably

and quietly hire the said coach and horses, and have free ingress, egress,

and regress throughout her journey, in and from the said coach, according

to the tenor, true intent, and meaning of these presents, without any let,

suit, trouble, disturbance, molestation, discharge, hinderance, forfeiture,

eviction, vexation, interruption, or incumbrance whatsoever.--And that it

shall moreover be lawful to and for the said Elizabeth Mollineux, from time

to time, and as oft or often as she shall well and truly be advanced in her

said pregnancy, to the time heretofore stipulated and agreed upon,--to live

and reside in such place or places, and in such family or families, and

with such relations, friends, and other persons within the said city of

London, as she at her own will and pleasure, notwithstanding her present

coverture, and as if she was a femme sole and unmarried,--shall think fit.-

-And this Indenture further witnesseth, That for the more effectually

carrying of the said covenant into execution, the said Walter Shandy,

merchant, doth hereby grant, bargain, sell, release, and confirm unto the

said John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. their heirs, executors, and

assigns, in their actual possession now being, by virtue of an indenture of 

bargain and sale for a year to them the said John Dixon, and James Turner,

Esqrs. by him the said Walter Shandy, merchant, thereof made; which said

bargain and sale for a year, bears date the day next before the date of

these presents, and by force and virtue of the statute for transferring of

uses into possession,--All that the manor and lordship of Shandy, in the

county of. . ., with all the rights, members, and appurtenances thereof;

and all and every the messuages, houses, buildings, barns, stables,

orchards, gardens, backsides, tofts, crofts, garths, cottages, lands,

meadows, feedings, pastures, marshes, commons, woods, underwoods, drains,

fisheries, waters, and water-courses;--together with all rents, reversions,

services, annuities, fee-farms, knights fees, views of frankpledge,

escheats, reliefs, mines, quarries, goods and chattels of felons and

fugitives, felons of themselves, and put in exigent, deodands, free

warrens, and all other royalties and seigniories, rights and jurisdictions,

privileges and hereditaments whatsoever.--And also the advowson, donation,

presentation, and free disposition of the rectory or parsonage of Shandy

aforesaid, and all and every the tenths, tythes, glebe-lands.'--In three

words,--'My mother was to lay in (if she chose it) in London.'



But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on the part

of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too manifestly opened

a door to, and which indeed had never been thought of at all, but for my

uncle Toby Shandy;--a clause was added in security of my father which was

this:--'That in case my mother hereafter should, at any time, put my father

to the trouble and expence of a London journey, upon false cries and

tokens;--that for every such instance, she should forfeit all the right and

title which the covenant gave her to the next turn;--but to no more,--and

so on, toties quoties, in as effectual a manner, as if such a covenant

betwixt them had not been made.'--This, by the way, was no more than what

was reasonable;--and yet, as reasonable as it was, I have ever thought it

hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely, as

it did, upon myself.



But I was begot and born to misfortunes;--for my poor mother, whether it

was wind or water--or a compound of both,--or neither;--or whether it was

simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in her;--or how far a strong

wish and desire to have it so, might mislead her judgment;--in short,

whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter, it no way becomes me

to decide.  The fact was this, That in the latter end of September 1717,

which was the year before I was born, my mother having carried my father up

to town much against the grain,--he peremptorily insisted upon the clause;-

-so that I was doom'd, by marriage-articles, to have my nose squeez'd as

flat to my face, as if the destinies had actually spun me without one.



How this event came about,--and what a train of vexatious disappointments,

in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me from the mere loss, or

rather compression, of this one single member,--shall be laid before the

reader all in due time. 





Chapter 1.XVI.



My father, as any body may naturally imagine, came down with my mother into

the country, in but a pettish kind of a humour.  The first twenty or five-

and-twenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself,

and indeed my mother too, about the cursed expence, which he said might

every shilling of it have been saved;--then what vexed him more than every

thing else was, the provoking time of the year,--which, as I told you, was

towards the end of September, when his wall-fruit and green gages

especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for pulling:--

'Had he been whistled up to London, upon a Tom Fool's errand, in any other

month of the whole year, he should not have said three words about it.'



For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the heavy blow

he had sustain'd from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully

reckon'd upon in his mind, and register'd down in his pocket-book, as a

second staff for his old age, in case Bobby should fail him.  'The

disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man, than all

the money which the journey, &c. had cost him, put together,--rot the

hundred and twenty pounds,--he did not mind it a rush.'



From Stilton, all the way to Grantham, nothing in the whole affair provoked

him so much as the condolences of his friends, and the foolish figure they

should both make at church, the first Sunday;--of which, in the satirical

vehemence of his wit, now sharpen'd a little by vexation, he would give so

many humorous and provoking descriptions,--and place his rib and self in so

many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole

congregation;--that my mother declared, these two stages were so truly

tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from one

end to the other of them all the way.



From Grantham, till they had cross'd the Trent, my father was out of all

kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my

mother had put upon him in this affair--'Certainly,' he would say to

himself, over and over again, 'the woman could not be deceived herself--if

she could,--what weakness!'--tormenting word!--which led his imagination a

thorny dance, and, before all was over, play'd the duce and all with him;--

for sure as ever the word weakness was uttered, and struck full upon his

brain--so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of

weaknesses there were;--that there was such a thing as weakness of the

body,--as well as weakness of the mind,--and then he would do nothing but

syllogize within himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of

all these vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.



In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of

this one affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in

it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy journey

of it down.--In a word, as she complained to my uncle Toby, he would have

tired out the patience of any flesh alive. 





Chapter 1.XVII.



Though my father travelled homewards, as I told you, in none of the best of

moods,--pshawing and pishing all the way down,--yet he had the complaisance

to keep the worst part of the story still to himself;--which was the

resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice, which my uncle Toby's

clause in the marriage-settlement empowered him; nor was it till the very

night in which I was begot, which was thirteen months after, that she had

the least intimation of his design:  when my father, happening, as you

remember, to be a little chagrin'd and out of temper,--took occasion as

they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over what was to

come,--to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she

could to the bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds; which was

to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year's

journey.



My father was a gentleman of many virtues,--but he had a strong spice of

that in his temper, which might, or might not, add to the number.--'Tis

known by the name of perseverance in a good cause,--and of obstinacy in a

bad one:  Of this my mother had so much knowledge, that she knew 'twas to

no purpose to make any remonstrance,--so she e'en resolved to sit down

quietly, and make the most of it.





Chapter 1.XVIII.



As the point was that night agreed, or rather determined, that my mother

should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly; for

which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with child,

she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife, whom you have so often heard

me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.

Manningham was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her

mind,--notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a

call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five

shillings book upon the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not

only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,--but had likewise super-added

many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross

births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the

world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I say, was absolutely

determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul's hand but

this old woman's only.--Now this I like;--when we cannot get at the very

thing we wish--never to take up with the next best in degree to it:--no;

that's pitiful beyond description;--it is no more than a week from this

very day, in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the

world;--which is March 9, 1759,--that my dear, dear Jenny, observing I

looked a little grave, as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty

shillings a yard,--told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much

trouble;--and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of ten-

pence a yard.--'Tis the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul;

only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother's case, was,

that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as

one in her situation might have wished, because the old midwife had really

some little claim to be depended upon,--as much, at least, as success could

give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the

parish, brought every mother's son of them into the world without any one

slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her account.



These facts, tho' they had their weight, yet did not altogether satisfy

some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father's spirits in

relation to this choice.--To say nothing of the natural workings of

humanity and justice--or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love,

all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case

of this kind;--he felt himself concerned in a particular manner, that all

should go right in the present case;--from the accumulated sorrow he lay

open to, should any evil betide his wife and child in lying-in at Shandy-

Hall.--He knew the world judged by events, and would add to his afflictions

in such a misfortune, by loading him with the whole blame of it.--'Alas

o'day;--had Mrs Shandy, poor gentlewoman! had but her wish in going up to

town just to lye-in and come down again;--which they say, she begged and

prayed for upon her bare knees,--and which, in my opinion, considering the

fortune which Mr Shandy got with her,--was no such mighty matter to have

complied with, the lady and her babe might both of them have been alive at

this hour.'



This exclamation, my father knew, was unanswerable;--and yet, it was not

merely to shelter himself,--nor was it altogether for the care of his

offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about this point;--

my father had extensive views of things,--and stood moreover, as he

thought, deeply concerned in it for the publick good, from the dread he

entertained of the bad uses an ill-fated instance might be put to.



He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had

unanimously agreed and lamented, from the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's

reign down to his own time, that the current of men and money towards the

metropolis, upon one frivolous errand or another,--set in so strong,--as to

become dangerous to our civil rights,--though, by the bye,--a current was

not the image he took most delight in,--a distemper was here his favourite

metaphor, and he would run it down into a perfect allegory, by maintaining

it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural,

where the blood and spirits were driven up into the head faster than they

could find their ways down;--a stoppage of circulation must ensue, which

was death in both cases.



There was little danger, he would say, of losing our liberties by French

politicks or French invasions;--nor was he so much in pain of a consumption

from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our

constitution, which he hoped was not so bad as it was imagined;--but he

verily feared, that in some violent push, we should go off, all at once, in

a state-apoplexy;--and then he would say, The Lord have mercy upon us all.



My father was never able to give the history of this distemper,--without

the remedy along with it.



'Was I an absolute prince,' he would say, pulling up his breeches with both

his hands, as he rose from his arm-chair, 'I would appoint able judges, at

every avenue of my metropolis, who should take cognizance of every fool's

business who came there;--and if, upon a fair and candid hearing, it

appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home, and come up, bag

and baggage, with his wife and children, farmer's sons, &c. &c. at his

backside, they should be all sent back, from constable to constable, like

vagrants as they were, to the place of their legal settlements.  By this

means I shall take care, that my metropolis totter'd not thro' its own

weight;--that the head be no longer too big for the body;--that the

extremes, now wasted and pinn'd in, be restored to their due share of

nourishment, and regain with it their natural strength and beauty:--I would

effectually provide, That the meadows and corn fields of my dominions,

should laugh and sing;--that good chear and hospitality flourish once

more;--and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of

the Squirality of my kingdom, as should counterpoise what I perceive my

Nobility are now taking from them.



'Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen's seats,' he would ask, with

some emotion, as he walked across the room, 'throughout so many delicious

provinces in France?  Whence is it that the few remaining Chateaus amongst

them are so dismantled,--so unfurnished, and in so ruinous and desolate a

condition?--Because, Sir' (he would say) 'in that kingdom no man has any

country-interest to support;--the little interest of any kind which any man

has any where in it, is concentrated in the court, and the looks of the

Grand Monarch:  by the sunshine of whose countenance, or the clouds which

pass across it, every French man lives or dies.'



Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to guard

against the least evil accident in my mother's lying-in in the country,--

was, That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power, too

great already, into the weaker vessels of the gentry, in his own, or higher

stations;--which, with the many other usurped rights which that part of the

constitution was hourly establishing,--would, in the end, prove fatal to

the monarchical system of domestick government established in the first

creation of things by God.



In this point he was entirely of Sir Robert Filmer's opinion, That the

plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of

the world, were, originally, all stolen from that admirable pattern and

prototype of this houshold and paternal power;--which, for a century, he

said, and more, had gradually been degenerating away into a mix'd

government;--the form of which, however desirable in great combinations of

the species,--was very troublesome in small ones,--and seldom produced any

thing, that he saw, but sorrow and confusion.



For all these reasons, private and publick, put together,--my father was

for having the man-midwife by all means,--my mother, by no means.  My

father begg'd and intreated, she would for once recede from her prerogative

in this matter, and suffer him to choose for her;--my mother, on the

contrary, insisted upon her privilege in this matter, to choose for

herself,--and have no mortal's help but the old woman's.--What could my

father do?  He was almost at his wit's end;--talked it over with her in all

moods;--placed his arguments in all lights;--argued the matter with her

like a christian,--like a heathen,--like a husband,--like a father,--like a

patriot,--like a man:--My mother answered every thing only like a woman;

which was a little hard upon her;--for as she could not assume and fight it

out behind such a variety of characters,--'twas no fair match:--'twas seven

to one.--What could my mother do?--She had the advantage (otherwise she had

been certainly overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin personal at

the bottom, which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute the affair with

my father with so equal an advantage,--that both sides sung Te Deum.  In a

word, my mother was to have the old woman,--and the operator was to have

licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father and my uncle Toby Shandy

in the back parlour,--for which he was to be paid five guineas.



I must beg leave, before I finish this chapter, to enter a caveat in the

breast of my fair reader;--and it is this,--Not to take it absolutely for

granted, from an unguarded word or two which I have dropp'd in it,--'That I

am a married man.'--I own, the tender appellation of my dear, dear Jenny,--

with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge, interspersed here and there,

might, naturally enough, have misled the most candid judge in the world

into such a determination against me.--All I plead for, in this case,

Madam, is strict justice, and that you do so much of it, to me as well as

to yourself,--as not to prejudge, or receive such an impression of me, till

you have better evidence, than, I am positive, at present can be produced

against me.--Not that I can be so vain or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire

you should therefore think, that my dear, dear Jenny is my kept mistress;--

no,--that would be flattering my character in the other extreme, and giving

it an air of freedom, which, perhaps, it has no kind of right to.  All I

contend for, is the utter impossibility, for some volumes, that you, or the

most penetrating spirit upon earth, should know how this matter really

stands.--It is not impossible, but that my dear, dear Jenny! tender as the

appellation is, may be my child.--Consider,--I was born in the year

eighteen.--Nor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in the

supposition, that my dear Jenny may be my friend.--Friend!--My friend.--

Surely, Madam, a friendship between the two sexes may subsist, and be

supported without--Fy! Mr Shandy:--Without any thing, Madam, but that

tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship, where there

is a difference of sex.  Let me intreat you to study the pure and

sentimental parts of the best French Romances;--it will really, Madam,

astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expressions this

delicious sentiment, which I have the honour to speak of, is dress'd out.





Chapter 1.XIX.



I would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in geometry, than

pretend to account for it, that a gentleman of my father's great good

sense,--knowing, as the reader must have observed him, and curious too in

philosophy,--wise also in political reasoning,--and in polemical (as he

will find) no way ignorant,--could be capable of entertaining a notion in

his head, so out of the common track,--that I fear the reader, when I come

to mention it to him, if he is the least of a cholerick temper, will

immediatly throw the book by; if mercurial, he will laugh most heartily at

it;--and if he is of a grave and saturnine cast, he will, at first sight,

absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant; and that was in respect to

the choice and imposition of christian names, on which he thought a great

deal more depended than what superficial minds were capable of conceiving.



His opinion, in this matter, was, That there was a strange kind of magick

bias, which good or bad names, as he called them, irresistibly impressed

upon our characters and conduct.



The hero of Cervantes argued not the point with more seriousness,--nor had

he more faith,--or more to say on the powers of necromancy in dishonouring

his deeds,--or on Dulcinea's name, in shedding lustre upon them, than my

father had on those of Trismegistus or Archimedes, on the one hand--or of

Nyky and Simkin on the other.  How many Caesars and Pompeys, he would say,

by mere inspiration of the names, have been rendered worthy of them?  And

how many, he would add, are there, who might have done exceeding well in

the world, had not their characters and spirits been totally depressed and

Nicodemus'd into nothing?



I see plainly, Sir, by your looks, (or as the case happened) my father

would say--that you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of mine,--

which, to those, he would add, who have not carefully sifted it to the

bottom,--I own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in it;--and

yet, my dear Sir, if I may presume to know your character, I am morally

assured, I should hazard little in stating a case to you, not as a party in

the dispute,--but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon it to your own

good sense and candid disquisition in this matter;--you are a person free

from as many narrow prejudices of education as most men;--and, if I may

presume to penetrate farther into you,--of a liberality of genius above

bearing down an opinion, merely because it wants friends.  Your son,--your

dear son,--from whose sweet and open temper you have so much to expect.--

Your Billy, Sir!--would you, for the world, have called him Judas?--Would

you, my dear Sir, he would say, laying his hand upon your breast, with the

genteelest address,--and in that soft and irresistible piano of voice,

which the nature of the argumentum ad hominem absolutely requires,--Would

you, Sir, if a Jew of a godfather had proposed the name for your child, and

offered you his purse along with it, would you have consented to such a

desecration of him?--O my God! he would say, looking up, if I know your

temper right, Sir,--you are incapable of it;--you would have trampled upon

the offer;--you would have thrown the temptation at the tempter's head with

abhorrence.



Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that generous

contempt of money, which you shew me in the whole transaction, is really

noble;--and what renders it more so, is the principle of it;--the workings

of a parent's love upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis,

namely, That was your son called Judas,--the forbid and treacherous idea,

so inseparable from the name, would have accompanied him through life like

his shadow, and, in the end, made a miser and a rascal of him, in spite,

Sir, of your example.



I never knew a man able to answer this argument.--But, indeed, to speak of

my father as he was;--he was certainly irresistible;--both in his orations

and disputations;--he was born an orator;--(Greek).--Persuasion hung upon

his lips, and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up in

him,--and, withal, he had so shrewd a guess at the weaknesses and passions

of his respondent,--that Nature might have stood up and said,--'This man is

eloquent.'--In short, whether he was on the weak or the strong side of the

question, 'twas hazardous in either case to attack him.--And yet, 'tis

strange, he had never read Cicero, nor Quintilian de Oratore, nor

Isocrates, nor Aristotle, nor Longinus, amongst the antients;--nor Vossius,

nor Skioppius, nor Ramus, nor Farnaby, amongst the moderns;--and what is

more astonishing, he had never in his whole life the least light or spark

of subtilty struck into his mind, by one single lecture upon Crackenthorp

or Burgersdicius or any Dutch logician or commentator;--he knew not so much

as in what the difference of an argument ad ignorantiam, and an argument ad

hominem consisted; so that I well remember, when he went up along with me

to enter my name at Jesus College in. . .,--it was a matter of just wonder

with my worthy tutor, and two or three fellows of that learned society,--

that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools, should be able

to work after that fashion with them.



To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my father was,

however, perpetually forced upon;--for he had a thousand little sceptical

notions of the comick kind to defend--most of which notions, I verily

believe, at first entered upon the footing of mere whims, and of a vive la

Bagatelle; and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or

so, and having sharpened his wit upon them, dismiss them till another day.



I mention this, not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the

progress and establishment of my father's many odd opinions,--but as a

warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such

guests, who, after a free and undisturbed entrance, for some years, into

our brains,--at length claim a kind of settlement there,--working sometimes

like yeast;--but more generally after the manner of the gentle passion,

beginning in jest,--but ending in downright earnest.



Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father's notions--or

that his judgment, at length, became the dupe of his wit;--or how far, in

many of his notions, he might, though odd, be absolutely right;--the

reader, as he comes at them, shall decide.  All that I maintain here, is,

that in this one, of the influence of christian names, however it gained

footing, he was serious;--he was all uniformity;--he was systematical, and,

like all systematic reasoners, he would move both heaven and earth, and

twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis.  In a

word I repeat it over again;--he was serious;--and, in consequence of it,

he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people, especially of

condition, who should have known better,--as careless and as indifferent

about the name they imposed upon their child,--or more so, than in the

choice of Ponto or Cupid for their puppy-dog.



This, he would say, look'd ill;--and had, moreover, this particular

aggravation in it, viz. That when once a vile name was wrongfully or

injudiciously given, 'twas not like the case of a man's character, which,

when wrong'd, might hereafter be cleared;--and, possibly, some time or

other, if not in the man's life, at least after his death,--be, somehow or

other, set to rights with the world:  But the injury of this, he would say,

could never be undone;--nay, he doubted even whether an act of parliament

could reach it:--He knew as well as you, that the legislature assumed a

power over surnames;--but for very strong reasons, which he could give, it

had never yet adventured, he would say, to go a step farther.



It was observable, that tho' my father, in consequence of this opinion,

had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and dislikings towards

certain names;--that there were still numbers of names which hung so

equally in the balance before him, that they were absolutely indifferent to

him.  Jack, Dick, and Tom were of this class:  These my father called

neutral names;--affirming of them, without a satire, That there had been as

many knaves and fools, at least, as wise and good men, since the world

began, who had indifferently borne them;--so that, like equal forces acting

against each other in contrary directions, he thought they mutually

destroyed each other's effects; for which reason, he would often declare,

He would not give a cherry-stone to choose amongst them.  Bob, which was my

brother's name, was another of these neutral kinds of christian names,

which operated very little either way; and as my father happen'd to be at

Epsom, when it was given him,--he would oft-times thank Heaven it was no

worse.  Andrew was something like a negative quantity in Algebra with him;-

-'twas worse, he said, than nothing.--William stood pretty high:--Numps

again was low with him:--and Nick, he said, was the Devil.



But of all names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion for

Tristram;--he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of any

thing in the world,--thinking it could possibly produce nothing in rerum

natura, but what was extremely mean and pitiful:  So that in the midst of a

dispute on the subject, in which, by the bye, he was frequently involved,--

he would sometimes break off in a sudden and spirited Epiphonema, or rather

Erotesis, raised a third, and sometimes a full fifth above the key of the

discourse,--and demand it categorically of his antagonist, Whether he would

take upon him to say, he had ever remembered,--whether he had ever read,--

or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, called Tristram,

performing any thing great or worth recording?--No,--he would say,--

Tristram!--The thing is impossible.



What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to publish this

notion of his to the world?  Little boots it to the subtle speculatist to

stand single in his opinions,--unless he gives them proper vent:--It was

the identical thing which my father did:--for in the year sixteen, which

was two years before I was born, he was at the pains of writing an express

Dissertation simply upon the word Tristram,--shewing the world, with great

candour and modesty, the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name.



When this story is compared with the title-page,--Will not the gentle

reader pity my father from his soul?--to see an orderly and well-disposed

gentleman, who tho' singular,--yet inoffensive in his notions,--so played

upon in them by cross purposes;--to look down upon the stage, and see him

baffled and overthrown in all his little systems and wishes; to behold a

train of events perpetually falling out against him, and in so critical and

cruel a way, as if they had purposedly been plann'd and pointed against

him, merely to insult his speculations.--In a word, to behold such a one,

in his old age, ill-fitted for troubles, ten times in a day suffering

sorrow;--ten times in a day calling the child of his prayers Tristram!--

Melancholy dissyllable of sound! which, to his ears, was unison to

Nincompoop, and every name vituperative under heaven.--By his ashes! I

swear it,--if ever malignant spirit took pleasure, or busied itself in

traversing the purposes of mortal man,--it must have been here;--and if it

was not necessary I should be born before I was christened, I would this

moment give the reader an account of it.





Chapter 1.XX.



--How could you, Madam, be so inattentive in reading the last chapter?  I

told you in it, That my mother was not a papist.--Papist!  You told me no

such thing, Sir.--Madam, I beg leave to repeat it over again, that I told

you as plain, at least, as words, by direct inference, could tell you such

a thing.--Then, Sir, I must have miss'd a page.--No, Madam, you have not

miss'd a word.--Then I was asleep, Sir.--My pride, Madam, cannot allow you

that refuge.--Then, I declare, I know nothing at all about the matter.--

That, Madam, is the very fault I lay to your charge; and as a punishment

for it, I do insist upon it, that you immediately turn back, that is as

soon as you get to the next full stop, and read the whole chapter over

again.  I have imposed this penance upon the lady, neither out of

wantonness nor cruelty; but from the best of motives; and therefore shall

make her no apology for it when she returns back:--'Tis to rebuke a vicious

taste, which has crept into thousands besides herself,--of reading straight

forwards, more in quest of the adventures, than of the deep erudition and

knowledge which a book of this cast, if read over as it should be, would

infallibly impart with them--The mind should be accustomed to make wise

reflections, and draw curious conclusions as it goes along; the habitude of

which made Pliny the younger affirm, 'That he never read a book so bad, but

he drew some profit from it.'  The stories of Greece and Rome, run over

without this turn and application,--do less service, I affirm it, than the

history of Parismus and Parismenus, or of the Seven Champions of England,

read with it.



--But here comes my fair lady.  Have you read over again the chapter,

Madam, as I desired you?--You have:  And did you not observe the passage,

upon the second reading, which admits the inference?--Not a word like it! 

Then, Madam, be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the

chapter, where I take upon me to say, 'It was necessary I should be born

before I was christen'd.'  Had my mother, Madam, been a Papist, that

consequence did not follow.  (The Romish Rituals direct the baptizing of

the child, in cases of danger, before it is born;--but upon this proviso,

That some part or other of the child's body be seen by the baptizer:--But

the Doctors of the Sorbonne, by a deliberation held amongst them, April 10,

1733,--have enlarged the powers of the midwives, by determining, That

though no part of the child's body should appear,--that baptism shall,

nevertheless, be administered to it by injection,--par le moyen d'une

petite canulle,--Anglice a squirt.--'Tis very strange that St. Thomas

Aquinas, who had so good a mechanical head, both for tying and untying the

knots of school-divinity,--should, after so much pains bestowed upon this,-

-give up the point at last, as a second La chose impossible,--'Infantes in

maternis uteris existentes (quoth St. Thomas!) baptizari possunt nullo

modo.'--O Thomas! Thomas!  If the reader has the curiosity to see the

question upon baptism by injection, as presented to the Doctors of the

Sorbonne, with their consultation thereupon, it is as follows.)



It is terrible misfortune for this same book of mine, but more so to the

Republick of letters;--so that my own is quite swallowed up in the

consideration of it,--that this self-same vile pruriency for fresh

adventures in all things, has got so strongly into our habit and humour,--

and so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of our

concupiscence that way,--that nothing but the gross and more carnal parts

of a composition will go down:--The subtle hints and sly communications of

science fly off, like spirits upwards,--the heavy moral escapes downwards;

and both the one and the other are as much lost to the world, as if they

were still left in the bottom of the ink-horn.



I wish the male-reader has not pass'd by many a one, as quaint and curious

as this one, in which the female-reader has been detected.  I wish it may

have its effects;--and that all good people, both male and female, from

example, may be taught to think as well as read.



Memoire presente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne 

Vide Deventer.  Paris Edit.  4to, 1734, p. 366.



Un Chirurgien Accoucheur, represente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne,

qu'il y a des cas, quoique tres rares, ou une mere ne scauroit accoucher, &

meme ou l'enfant est tellement renferme dans le sein de sa mere, qu'il ne

fait paroitre aucune partie de son corps, ce qui seroit un cas, suivant les

Rituels, de lui conferer, du moins sous condition, le bapteme.  Le

Chirurgien, qui consulte, pretend, par le moyen d'une petite canulle, de

pouvoir baptiser immediatement l'enfant, sans faire aucun tort a la mere.--

Il demand si ce moyen, qu'il vient de proposer, est permis & legitime, &

s'il peut s'en servir dans les cas qu'il vient d'exposer.



Reponse



Le Conseil estime, que la question proposee souffre de grandes difficultes.

Les Theologiens posent d'un cote pour principe, que le bapteme, qui est une

naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance; il faut etre ne dans

le monde, pour renaitre en Jesus Christ, comme ils l'enseignent.  S.

Thomas, 3 part. quaest. 88 artic. II. suit cette doctrine comme une verite

constante; l'on ne peut, dit ce S. Docteur, baptiser les enfans qui sont

renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, & S. Thomas est fonde sur ce, que

les enfans ne sont point nes, & ne peuvent etre comptes parmi les autres

hommes; d'ou il conclud, qu'ils ne peuvent etre l'objet d'une action

exterieure, pour recevoir par leur ministere, les sacremens necessaires au

salut:  Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodierunt in lucem ut

cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant; unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae,

ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem.  Les rituels

ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les theologiens ont etabli sur les memes

matieres, & ils deffendent tous d'une maniere uniforme, de baptiser les

enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, s'ils ne sont

paroitre quelque partie de leurs corps.  Le concours des theologiens, & des

rituels, qui sont les regles des dioceses, paroit former une autorite qui

termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience

considerant d'un cote, que le raisonnement des theologiens est uniquement

fonde sur une raison de convenance, & que la deffense des rituels suppose

que l'on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermes dans le

sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; & d'un

autre cote, considerant que les memes theologiens enseignent, que l'on peut

risquer les sacremens que Jesus Christ a etablis comme des moyens faciles,

mais necessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; & d'ailleurs estimant, que les

enfans renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient etre capables de

salut, parcequ'ils sont capables de damnation;--pour ces considerations, &

en egard a l'expose, suivant lequel on assure avoir trouve un moyen certain

de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renfermes, sans faire aucun tort a la mere, le

Conseil estime que l'on pourroit se servir du moyen propose, dans la

confiance qu'il a, que Dieu n'a point laisse ces sortes d'enfans sans

aucuns secours, & supposant, comme il est expose, que le moyen dont il

s'agit est propre a leur procurer le bapteme; cependant comme il s'agiroit,

en autorisant la pratique proposee, de changer une regle universellement

etablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s'addresser a son

eveque, & a qui il appartient de juger de l'utilite, & du danger du moyen

propose, & comme, sous le bon plaisir de l'eveque, le Conseil estime qu'il

faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d'expliquer les regles de

l'eglise, & d'y deroger dans le cas, ou la loi ne scauroit obliger, quelque

sage & quelque utile que paroisse la maniere de baptiser dont il s'agit, le

Conseil ne pourroit l'approver sans le concours de ces deux autorites.  On

conseile au moins a celui qui consulte, de s'addresser a son eveque, & de

lui faire part de la presente decision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans

les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussignes s'appuyent, il puisse

etre autorise dans le cas de necessite, ou il risqueroit trop d'attendre

que la permission fut demandee & accordee d'employer le moyen qu'il propose

si avantageux au salut de l'enfant.  Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que

l'on pourroit s'en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il

s'agit, venoient au monde, contre l'esperance de ceux qui se seroient

servis du meme moyen, il seroit necessaire de les baptiser sous condition;

& en cela le Conseil se conforme a tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le

bapteme d'un enfant qui fait paroitre quelque partie de son corps,

enjoignent neantmoins, & ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s'il

vient heureusement au monde.

Mr Tristram Shandy's compliments to Messrs. Le Moyne, De Romigny, and De

Marcilly; hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a

consultation.--He begs to know, whether after the ceremony of marriage, and

before that of consummation, the baptizing all the Homunculi at once,

slapdash, by injection, would not be a shorter and safer cut still; on

condition, as above, That if the Homunculi do well, and come safe into the

world after this, that each and every of them shall be baptized again (sous

condition)--And provided, in the second place, That the thing can be done,

which Mr Shandy apprehends it may, par le moyen d'une petite canulle, and

sans faire aucune tort au pere.





Chapter 1.XXI.



--I wonder what's all that noise, and running backwards and forwards for,

above stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself, after an hour and a

half's silence, to my uncle Toby,--who, you must know, was sitting on the

opposite side of the fire, smoaking his social pipe all the time, in mute

contemplation of a new pair of black plush-breeches which he had got on:--

What can they be doing, brother?--quoth my father,--we can scarce hear

ourselves talk.



I think, replied my uncle Toby, taking his pipe from his mouth, and

striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left thumb,

as he began his sentence,--I think, says he:--But to enter rightly into my

uncle Toby's sentiments upon this matter, you must be made to enter first a

little into his character, the out-lines of which I shall just give you,

and then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well again.



Pray what was that man's name,--for I write in such a hurry, I have no time

to recollect or look for it,--who first made the observation, 'That there

was great inconstancy in our air and climate?'  Whoever he was, 'twas a

just and good observation in him.--But the corollary drawn from it, namely,

'That it is this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and

whimsical characters;'--that was not his;--it was found out by another man,

at least a century and a half after him:  Then again,--that this copious

store-house of original materials, is the true and natural cause that our

Comedies are so much better than those of France, or any others that either

have, or can be wrote upon the Continent:--that discovery was not fully

made till about the middle of King William's reign,--when the great Dryden,

in writing one of his long prefaces, (if I mistake not) most fortunately

hit upon it.  Indeed toward the latter end of queen Anne, the great Addison

began to patronize the notion, and more fully explained it to the world in

one or two of his Spectators;--but the discovery was not his.--Then,

fourthly and lastly, that this strange irregularity in our climate,

producing so strange an irregularity in our characters,--doth thereby, in

some sort, make us amends, by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when

the weather will not suffer us to go out of doors,--that observation is my

own;--and was struck out by me this very rainy day, March 26, 1759, and

betwixt the hours of nine and ten in the morning.



Thus--thus, my fellow-labourers and associates in this great harvest of our

learning, now ripening before our eyes; thus it is, by slow steps of casual

increase, that our knowledge physical, metaphysical, physiological,

polemical, nautical, mathematical, aenigmatical, technical, biographical,

romantical, chemical, and obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it,

(most of 'em ending as these do, in ical) have for these two last centuries

and more, gradually been creeping upwards towards that Akme of their

perfections, from which, if we may form a conjecture from the advances of

these last seven years, we cannot possibly be far off.



When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all kind of

writings whatsoever;--the want of all kind of writing will put an end to

all kind of reading;--and that in time, As war begets poverty; poverty

peace,--must, in course, put an end to all kind of knowledge,--and then--we

shall have all to begin over again; or, in other words, be exactly where we

started.



--Happy!  Thrice happy times!  I only wish that the aera of my begetting,

as well as the mode and manner of it, had been a little alter'd,--or that

it could have been put off, with any convenience to my father or mother,

for some twenty or five-and-twenty years longer, when a man in the literary

world might have stood some chance.--



But I forget my uncle Toby, whom all this while we have left knocking the

ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.



His humour was of that particular species, which does honour to our

atmosphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one of

the first-rate productions of it, had not there appeared too many strong

lines in it of a family-likeness, which shewed that he derived the

singularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or water, or

any modifications or combinations of them whatever:  And I have, therefore,

oft-times wondered, that my father, tho' I believe he had his reasons for

it, upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity, in my course, when I

was a boy,--should never once endeavour to account for them in this way: 

for all the Shandy Family were of an original character throughout:--I mean

the males,--the females had no character at all,--except, indeed, my great

aunt Dinah, who, about sixty years ago, was married and got with child by

the coachman, for which my father, according to his hypothesis of christian

names, would often say, She might thank her godfathers and godmothers.



It will seem strange,--and I would as soon think of dropping a riddle in

the reader's way, which is not my interest to do, as set him upon guessing

how it could come to pass, that an event of this kind, so many years after

it had happened, should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and

unity, which otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my father and my

uncle Toby.  One would have thought, that the whole force of the misfortune

should have spent and wasted itself in the family at first,--as is

generally the case.--But nothing ever wrought with our family after the

ordinary way.  Possibly at the very time this happened, it might have

something else to afflict it; and as afflictions are sent down for our

good, and that as this had never done the Shandy Family any good at all, it

might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an

opportunity to discharge its office.--Observe, I determine nothing upon

this.--My way is ever to point out to the curious, different tracts of

investigation, to come at the first springs of the events I tell;--not with

a pedantic Fescue,--or in the decisive manner or Tacitus, who outwits

himself and his reader;--but with the officious humility of a heart devoted

to the assistance merely of the inquisitive;--to them I write,--and by them

I shall be read,--if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out

so long,--to the very end of the world.



Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father and

uncle, is undetermined by me.  But how and in what direction it exerted

itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them, after it

began to operate, is what I am able to explain with great exactness, and is

as follows:



My uncle Toby Shandy, Madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues which

usually constitute the character of a man of honour and rectitude,--

possessed one in a very eminent degree, which is seldom or never put into

the catalogue; and that was a most extreme and unparallel'd modesty of

nature;--though I correct the word nature, for this reason, that I may not

prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing, and that is, Whether

this modesty of his was natural or acquir'd.--Whichever way my uncle Toby

came by it, 'twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it; and that

is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so unhappy as to have very

little choice in them,--but to things;--and this kind of modesty so

possessed him, and it arose to such a height in him, as almost to equal, if

such a thing could be, even the modesty of a woman:  That female nicety,

Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which makes

you so much the awe of ours.



You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle Toby had contracted all this from

this very source;--that he had spent a great part of his time in converse

with your sex, and that from a thorough knowledge of you, and the force of

imitation which such fair examples render irresistible, he had acquired

this amiable turn of mind.



I wish I could say so,--for unless it was with his sister-in-law, my

father's wife and my mother--my uncle Toby scarce exchanged three words

with the sex in as many years;--no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.--A blow!--

Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke off by a ball from

the parapet of a horn-work at the siege of Namur, which struck full upon my

uncle Toby's groin.--Which way could that effect it?  The story of that,

Madam, is long and interesting;--but it would be running my history all

upon heaps to give it you here.--'Tis for an episode hereafter; and every

circumstance relating to it, in its proper place, shall be faithfully laid

before you:--'Till then, it is not in my power to give farther light into

this matter, or say more than what I have said already,--That my uncle Toby

was a gentleman of unparallel'd modesty, which happening to be somewhat

subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family pride,--

they both so wrought together within him, that he could never bear to hear

the affair of my aunt Dinah touch'd upon, but with the greatest emotion.--

The least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face;--but

when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies, which the

illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to do,--the

unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family, would set

my uncle Toby's honour and modesty o'bleeding; and he would often take my

father aside, in the greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell

him, he would give him any thing in the world, only to let the story rest.



My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle Toby,

that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done any thing

in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir'd of another, to

have made my uncle Toby's heart easy in this, or any other point.  But this

lay out of his power. 



--My father, as I told you was a philosopher in grain,--speculative,--

systematical;--and my aunt Dinah's affair was a matter of as much

consequence to him, as the retrogradation of the planets to Copernicus:--

The backslidings of Venus in her orbit fortified the Copernican system,

called so after his name; and the backslidings of my aunt Dinah in her

orbit, did the same service in establishing my father's system, which, I

trust, will for ever hereafter be called the Shandean System, after his.



In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice a sense of

shame as any man whatever;--and neither he, nor, I dare say, Copernicus,

would have divulged the affair in either case, or have taken the least

notice of it to the world, but for the obligations they owed, as they

thought, to truth.--Amicus Plato, my father would say, construing the words

to my uncle Toby, as he went along, Amicus Plato; that is, Dinah was my

aunt;--sed magis amica veritas--but Truth is my sister.



This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the source

of many a fraternal squabble.  The one could not bear to hear the tale of

family disgrace recorded,--and the other would scarce ever let a day pass

to an end without some hint at it.



For God's sake, my uncle Toby would cry,--and for my sake, and for all our

sakes, my dear brother Shandy,--do let this story of our aunt's and her

ashes sleep in peace;--how can you,--how can you have so little feeling and

compassion for the character of our family?--What is the character of a

family to an hypothesis? my father would reply.--Nay, if you come to that--

what is the life of a family?--The life of a family!--my uncle Toby would

say, throwing himself back in his arm chair, and lifting up his hands, his

eyes, and one leg--Yes, the life,--my father would say, maintaining his

point.  How many thousands of 'em are there every year that come cast away,

(in all civilized countries at least)--and considered as nothing but common

air, in competition of an hypothesis.  In my plain sense of things, my

uncle Toby would answer,--every such instance is downright Murder, let who

will commit it.--There lies your mistake, my father would reply;--for, in

Foro Scientiae there is no such thing as Murder,--'tis only Death, brother.



My uncle Toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind of

argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of Lillebullero.--You

must know it was the usual channel thro' which his passions got vent, when

any thing shocked or surprized him:--but especially when any thing, which

he deem'd very absurd, was offered.



As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon them,

that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to this particular

species of argument.--I here take the liberty to do it myself, for two

reasons.  First, That, in order to prevent all confusion in disputes, it

may stand as much distinguished for ever, from every other species of

argument--as the Argumentum ad Verecundiam, ex Absurdo, ex Fortiori, or any

other argument whatsoever:--And, secondly, That it may be said by my

children's children, when my head is laid to rest,--that their learn'd

grandfather's head had been busied to as much purpose once, as other

people's;--That he had invented a name, and generously thrown it into the

Treasury of the Ars Logica, for one of the most unanswerable arguments in

the whole science.  And, if the end of disputation is more to silence than

convince,--they may add, if they please, to one of the best arguments too.



I do, therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command, That it be

known and distinguished by the name and title of the Argumentum

Fistulatorium, and no other;--and that it rank hereafter with the

Argumentum Baculinum and the Argumentum ad Crumenam, and for ever hereafter

be treated of in the same chapter. 



As for the Argumentum Tripodium, which is never used but by the woman

against the man;--and the Argumentum ad Rem, which, contrarywise, is made

use of by the man only against the woman;--As these two are enough in

conscience for one lecture;--and, moreover, as the one is the best answer

to the other,--let them likewise be kept apart, and be treated of in a

place by themselves.







Chapter 1.XXII.



The learned Bishop Hall, I mean the famous Dr. Joseph Hall, who was Bishop

of Exeter in King James the First's reign, tells us in one of Decads, at

the end of his divine art of meditation, imprinted at London, in the year

1610, by John Beal, dwelling in Aldersgate-street, 'That it is an

abominable thing for a man to commend himself;'--and I really think it is

so.



And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a masterly kind of

a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found out;--I think it is full

as abominable, that a man should lose the honour of it, and go out of the

world with the conceit of it rotting in his head.



This is precisely my situation.



 For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into, as in all

my digressions (one only excepted) there is a master-stroke of digressive

skill, the merit of which has all along, I fear, been over-looked by my

reader,--not for want of penetration in him,--but because 'tis an

excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a digression;--and it

is this:  That tho' my digressions are all fair, as you observe,--and that

I fly off from what I am about, as far, and as often too, as any writer in

Great Britain; yet I constantly take care to order affairs so that my main

business does not stand still in my absence.



I was just going, for example, to have given you the great out-lines of my

uncle Toby's most whimsical character;--when my aunt Dinah and the coachman

came across us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very

heart of the planetary system:  Notwithstanding all this, you perceive that

the drawing of my uncle Toby's character went on gently all the time;--not

the great contours of it,--that was impossible,--but some familiar strokes

and faint designations of it, were here and there touch'd on, as we went

along, so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle Toby now than

you was before.



By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself; two

contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconciled, which were thought

to be at variance with each other.  In a word, my work is digressive, and

it is progressive too,--and at the same time.



This, Sir, is a very different story from that of the earth's moving round

her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her progress in her elliptick orbit

which brings about the year, and constitutes that variety and vicissitude

of seasons we enjoy;--though I own it suggested the thought,--as I believe

the greatest of our boasted improvements and discoveries have come from

such trifling hints.



Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine;--they are the life, the soul

of reading!--take them out of this book, for instance,--you might as well

take the book along with them;--one cold eternal winter would reign in

every page of it; restore them to the writer;--he steps forth like a

bridegroom,--bids All-hail; brings in variety, and forbids the appetite to

fail.



All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them, so as to

be not only for the advantage of the reader, but also of the author, whose

distress, in this matter, is truly pitiable:  For, if he begins a

digression,--from that moment, I observe, his whole work stands stock

still;--and if he goes on with his main work,--then there is an end of his

digression.



--This is vile work.--For which reason, from the beginning of this, you

see, I have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with

such intersections, and have so complicated and involved the digressive and

progressive movements, one wheel within another, that the whole machine, in

general, has been kept a'going;--and; what's more, it shall be kept a-going

these forty years, if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me so long

with life and good spirits.





Chapter 1.XXIII.



I have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very nonsensically,

and I will not balk my fancy.--Accordingly I set off thus:



If the fixture of Momus's glass in the human breast, according to the

proposed emendation of that arch-critick, had taken place,--first, This

foolish consequence would certainly have followed,--That the very wisest

and very gravest of us all, in one coin or other, must have paid window-

money every day of our lives.



And, secondly, that had the said glass been there set up, nothing more

would have been wanting, in order to have taken a man's character, but to

have taken a chair and gone softly, as you would to a dioptrical bee-hive,

and look'd in,--view'd the soul stark naked;--observed all her motions,--

her machinations;--traced all her maggots from their first engendering to

their crawling forth;--watched her loose in her frisks, her gambols, her

capricios; and after some notice of her more solemn deportment, consequent

upon such frisks, &c.--then taken your pen and ink and set down nothing but

what you had seen, and could have sworn to:--But this is an advantage not

to be had by the biographer in this planet;--in the planet Mercury (belike)

it may be so, if not better still for him;--for there the intense heat of

the country, which is proved by computators, from its vicinity to the sun,

to be more than equal to that of red-hot iron,--must, I think, long ago

have vitrified the bodies of the inhabitants, (as the efficient cause) to

suit them for the climate (which is the final cause;) so that betwixt them

both, all the tenements of their souls, from top to bottom, may be nothing

else, for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary, but one

fine transparent body of clear glass (bating the umbilical knot)--so that,

till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of

light, in passing through them, become so monstrously refracted,--or return

reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye, that a

man cannot be seen through;--his soul might as well, unless for mere

ceremony, or the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave her,--

might, upon all other accounts, I say, as well play the fool out o'doors as

in her own house.



But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of this

earth;--our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapt up here in a

dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so that, if we would come

to the specific characters of them, we must go some other way to work.



Many, in good truth, are the ways, which human wit has been forced to take,

to do this thing with exactness.



Some, for instance, draw all their characters with wind-instruments.--

Virgil takes notice of that way in the affair of Dido and Aeneas;--but it

is as fallacious as the breath of fame;--and, moreover, bespeaks a narrow

genius. I am not ignorant that the Italians pretend to a mathematical

exactness in their designations of one particular sort of character among

them, from the forte or piano of a certain wind-instrument they use,--which

they say is infallible.--I dare not mention the name of the instrument in

this place;--'tis sufficient we have it amongst us,--but never think of

making a drawing by it;--this is aenigmatical, and intended to be so, at

least ad populum:--And therefore, I beg, Madam, when you come here, that

you read on as fast as you can, and never stop to make any inquiry about

it.



There are others again, who will draw a man's character from no other helps

in the world, but merely from his evacuations;--but this often gives a very

incorrect outline,--unless, indeed, you take a sketch of his repletions

too; and by correcting one drawing from the other, compound one good figure

out of them both.



I should have no objection to this method, but that I think it must smell

too strong of the lamp,--and be render'd still more operose, by forcing you

to have an eye to the rest of his Non-naturals.--Why the most natural

actions of a man's life should be called his Non-naturals,--is another

question.



There are others, fourthly, who disdain every one of these expedients;--not

from any fertility of their own, but from the various ways of doing it,

which they have borrowed from the honourable devices which the Pentagraphic

Brethren (Pentagraph, an instrument to copy Prints and Pictures

mechanically, and in any proportion.) of the brush have shewn in taking

copies.--These, you must know, are your great historians.



One of these you will see drawing a full length character against the

light;--that's illiberal,--dishonest,--and hard upon the character of the

man who sits.



Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the Camera;--that

is most unfair of all, because, there you are sure to be represented in

some of your most ridiculous attitudes.



To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle Toby's

character, I am determined to draw it by no mechanical help whatever;--nor

shall my pencil be guided by any one wind-instrument which ever was blown

upon, either on this, or on the other side of the Alps;--nor will I

consider either his repletions or his discharges,--or touch upon his Non-

naturals; but, in a word, I will draw my uncle Toby's character from his

Hobby-Horse.





Chapter 1.XXIV.



If I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for

my uncle Toby's character,--I would here previously have convinced him that

there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with, as that which I

have pitch'd upon.



A man and his Hobby-Horse, tho' I cannot say that they act and re-act

exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each

other:  Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind;

and my opinion rather is, that there is something in it more of the manner

of electrified bodies,--and that, by means of the heated parts of the

rider, which come immediately into contact with the back of the Hobby-

Horse,--by long journies and much friction, it so happens, that the body of

the rider is at length fill'd as full of Hobby-Horsical matter as it can

hold;--so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the

nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and

character of the other. 



Now the Hobby-Horse which my uncle Toby always rode upon, was in my opinion

an Hobby-Horse well worth giving a description of, if it was only upon the

score of his great singularity;--for you might have travelled from York to

Dover,--from Dover to Penzance in Cornwall, and from Penzance to York back

again, and not have seen such another upon the road; or if you had seen

such a one, whatever haste you had been in, you must infallibly have

stopp'd to have taken a view of him.  Indeed, the gait and figure of him

was so strange, and so utterly unlike was he, from his head to his tail, to

any one of the whole species, that it was now and then made a matter of

dispute,--whether he was really a Hobby-Horse or no:  But as the

Philosopher would use no other argument to the Sceptic, who disputed with

him against the reality of motion, save that of rising up upon his legs,

and walking across the room;--so would my uncle Toby use no other argument

to prove his Hobby-Horse was a Hobby-Horse indeed, but by getting upon his

back and riding him about;--leaving the world, after that, to determine the

point as it thought fit.



In good truth, my uncle Toby mounted him with so much pleasure, and he

carried my uncle Toby so well,--that he troubled his head very little with

what the world either said or thought about it.



It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of him:--But to

go on regularly, I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first,

how my uncle Toby came by him.





Chapter 1.XXV.



The wound in my uncle Toby's groin, which he received at the siege of

Namur, rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought expedient he

should return to England, in order, if possible, to be set to rights.



He was four years totally confined,--part of it to his bed, and all of it

to his room:  and in the course of his cure, which was all that time in

hand, suffer'd unspeakable miseries,--owing to a succession of exfoliations

from the os pubis, and the outward edge of that part of the coxendix called

the os illium,--both which bones were dismally crush'd, as much by the

irregularity of the stone, which I told you was broke off the parapet,--as

by its size,--(tho' it was pretty large) which inclined the surgeon all

along to think, that the great injury which it had done my uncle Toby's

groin, was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself, than to the

projectile force of it,--which he would often tell him was a great

happiness.



My father at that time was just beginning business in London, and had taken

a house;--and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the

two brothers,--and that my father thought my uncle Toby could no where be

so well nursed and taken care of as in his own house,--he assign'd him the

very best apartment in it.--And what was a much more sincere mark of his

affection still, he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step

into the house on any occasion, but he would take him by the hand, and lead

him up stairs to see his brother Toby, and chat an hour by his bed-side.



The history of a soldier's wound beguiles the pain of it;--my uncle's

visitors at least thought so, and in their daily calls upon him, from the

courtesy arising out of that belief, they would frequently turn the

discourse to that subject,--and from that subject the discourse would

generally roll on to the siege itself.



These conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle Toby received great

relief from them, and would have received much more, but that they brought

him into some unforeseen perplexities, which, for three months together,

retarded his cure greatly; and if he had not hit upon an expedient to

extricate himself out of them, I verily believe they would have laid him in

his grave.



What these perplexities of my uncle Toby were,--'tis impossible for you to

guess;--if you could,--I should blush; not as a relation,--not as a man,--

nor even as a woman,--but I should blush as an author; inasmuch as I set no

small store by myself upon this very account, that my reader has never yet

been able to guess at any thing.  And in this, Sir, I am of so nice and

singular a humour, that if I thought you was able to form the least

judgment or probable conjecture to yourself, of what was to come in the

next page,--I would tear it out of my book.





Chapter 1.XXVI.



I have begun a new book, on purpose that I might have room enough to

explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle Toby was involved,

from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of Namur, where

he received his wound.



I must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of King William's

wars,--but if he has not,--I then inform him, that one of the most

memorable attacks in that siege, was that which was made by the English and

Dutch upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, between the gate of St.

Nicolas, which inclosed the great sluice or water-stop, where the English

were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard and demi-bastion of

St. Roch:  The issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was this;  That

the Dutch lodged themselves upon the counter-guard,--and that the English

made themselves masters of the covered-way before St. Nicolas-gate,

notwithstanding the gallantry of the French officers, who exposed

themselves upon the glacis sword in hand.



As this was the principal attack of which my uncle Toby was an eye-witness

at Namur,--the army of the besiegers being cut off, by the confluence of

the Maes and Sambre, from seeing much of each other's operations,--my uncle

Toby was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it; and

the many perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable

difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving such

clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and

counterscarp,--the glacis and covered-way,--the half-moon and ravelin,--as

to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about.



Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms; so that you will

the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in opposition to

many misconceptions, that my uncle Toby did oft-times puzzle his visitors,

and sometimes himself too.



To speak the truth, unless the company my father led up stairs were

tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle Toby was in one of his explanatory

moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the discourse

free from obscurity.



What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle

Toby, was this,--that in the attack of the counterscarp, before the gate of

St. Nicolas, extending itself from the bank of the Maes, quite up to the

great water-stop,--the ground was cut and cross cut with such a multitude

of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,--and he would get so

sadly bewildered, and set fast amongst them, that frequently he could

neither get backwards or forwards to save his life; and was oft-times

obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only. 



These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle Toby Shandy more perturbations than

you would imagine; and as my father's kindness to him was continually

dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirers,--he had but a very uneasy

task of it. 



No doubt my uncle Toby had great command of himself,--and could guard

appearances, I believe, as well as most men;--yet any one may imagine, that

when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half-

moon, or get out of the covered-way without falling down the counterscarp,

nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch, but that he

must have fretted and fumed inwardly:--He did so;--and the little and

hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who

has not read Hippocrates, yet, whoever has read Hippocrates, or Dr. James

Mackenzie, and has considered well the effects which the passions and

affections of the mind have upon the digestion--(Why not of a wound as well

as of a dinner?)--may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms and

exacerbations of his wound my uncle Toby must have undergone upon that

score only.



--My uncle Toby could not philosophize upon it;--'twas enough he felt it

was so,--and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months

together, he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself.



He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and nature

of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other position, when

a thought came into his head, that if he could purchase such a thing, and

have it pasted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortification of

the town and citadel of Namur, with its environs, it might be a means of

giving him ease.--I take notice of his desire to have the environs along

with the town and citadel, for this reason,--because my uncle Toby's wound

was got in one of the traverses, about thirty toises from the returning

angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of

St. Roch:--so that he was pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the

identical spot of ground where he was standing on when the stone struck

him.



All this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a world of

sad explanations, but, in the end, it proved the happy means, as you will

read, of procuring my uncle Toby his Hobby-Horse.





Chapter 1.XXVII.



There is nothing so foolish, when you are at the expence of making an

entertainment of this kind, as to order things so badly, as to let your

criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down:  Nor is there any thing

so likely to make them do it, as that of leaving them out of the party, or,

what is full as offensive, of bestowing your attention upon the rest of

your guests in so particular a way, as if there was no such thing as a

critick (by occupation) at table.



--I guard against both; for, in the first place, I have left half a dozen

places purposely open for them;--and in the next place, I pay them all

court.--Gentlemen, I kiss your hands, I protest no company could give me

half the pleasure,--by my soul I am glad to see you--I beg only you will

make no strangers of yourselves, but sit down without any ceremony, and

fall on heartily.



I said I had left six places, and I was upon the point of carrying my

complaisance so far, as to have left a seventh open for them,--and in this

very spot I stand on; but being told by a Critick (tho' not by occupation,-

-but by nature) that I had acquitted myself well enough, I shall fill it up

directly, hoping, in the mean time, that I shall be able to make a great

deal of more room next year. 



--How, in the name of wonder! could your uncle Toby, who, it seems, was a

military man, and whom you have represented as no fool,--be at the same

time such a confused, pudding-headed, muddle-headed, fellow, as--Go look.



So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I scorn it.--'Tis language

unurbane,--and only befitting the man who cannot give clear and

satisfactory accounts of things, or dive deep enough into the first causes

of human ignorance and confusion.  It is moreover the reply valiant--and

therefore I reject it; for tho' it might have suited my uncle Toby's

character as a soldier excellently well,--and had he not accustomed

himself, in such attacks, to whistle the Lillabullero, as he wanted no

courage, 'tis the very answer he would have given; yet it would by no means

have done for me.  You see as plain as can be, that I write as a man of

erudition;--that even my similies, my allusions, my illustrations, my

metaphors, are erudite,--and that I must sustain my character properly, and

contrast it properly too,--else what would become of me?  Why, Sir, I

should be undone;--at this very moment that I am going here to fill up one

place against a critick,--I should have made an opening for a couple.



--Therefore I answer thus:



Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you ever read

such a book as Locke's Essay upon the Human Understanding?--Don't answer me

rashly--because many, I know, quote the book, who have not read it--and

many have read it who understand it not:--If either of these is your case,

as I write to instruct, I will tell you in three words what the book is.--

It is a history.--A history! of who? what? where? when?  Don't hurry

yourself--It is a history-book, Sir, (which may possibly recommend it to

the world) of what passes in a man's own mind; and if you will say so much

of the book, and no more, believe me, you will cut no contemptible figure

in a metaphysick circle.



But this by the way.



Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into the bottom

of this matter, it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion,

in the mind of a man, is threefold.



Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place.  Secondly, slight and transient

impressions made by the objects, when the said organs are not dull.  And

thirdly, a memory like unto a sieve, not able to retain what it has

received.--Call down Dolly your chamber-maid, and I will give you my cap

and bell along with it, if I make not this matter so plain that Dolly

herself should understand it as well as Malbranch.--When Dolly has indited

her epistle to Robin, and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket

hanging by her right side;--take that opportunity to recollect that the

organs and faculties of perception can, by nothing in this world, be so

aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which Dolly's hand is in

search of.--Your organs are not so dull that I should inform you--'tis an

inch, Sir, of red seal-wax.



When this is melted and dropped upon the letter, if Dolly fumbles too long

for her thimble, till the wax is over hardened, it will not receive the

mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it. 

Very well.  If Dolly's wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper

too soft,--tho' it may receive,--it will not hold the impression, how hard

soever Dolly thrusts against it; and last of all, supposing the wax good,

and eke the thimble, but applied thereto in careless haste, as her Mistress

rings the bell;--in any one of these three cases the print left by the

thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brass-jack.



Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the

confusion in my uncle Toby's discourse; and it is for that very reason I

enlarge upon them so long, after the manner of great physiologists--to shew

the world, what it did not arise from.



What it did arise from, I have hinted above, and a fertile source of

obscurity it is,--and ever will be,--and that is the unsteady uses of

words, which have perplexed the clearest and most exalted understandings.



It is ten to one (at Arthur's) whether you have ever read the literary

histories of past ages;--if you have, what terrible battles, 'yclept

logomachies, have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and

ink-shed,--that a good-natured man cannot read the accounts of them without

tears in his eyes.



Gentle critick! when thou hast weighed all this, and considered within

thyself how much of thy own knowledge, discourse, and conversation has been

pestered and disordered, at one time or other, by this, and this only:--

What a pudder and racket in Councils about (Greek); and in the Schools of

the learned about power and about spirit;--about essences, and about

quintessences;--about substances, and about space.--What confusion in

greater Theatres from words of little meaning, and as indeterminate a

sense! when thou considerest this, thou wilt not wonder at my uncle Toby's

perplexities,--thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his

counterscarp;--his glacis and his covered way;--his ravelin and his half-

moon:  'Twas not by ideas,--by Heaven; his life was put in jeopardy by

words.





Chapter 1.XXVIII.



When my uncle Toby got his map of Namur to his mind, he began immediately

to apply himself, and with the utmost diligence, to the study of it; for

nothing being of more importance to him than his recovery, and his recovery

depending, as you have read, upon the passions and affections of his mind,

it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his

subject, as to be able to talk upon it without emotion.



In a fortnight's close and painful application, which, by the bye, did my

uncle Toby's wound, upon his groin, no good,--he was enabled, by the help

of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant, together with

Gobesius's military architecture and pyroballogy, translated from the

Flemish, to form his discourse with passable perspicuity; and before he was

two full months gone,--he was right eloquent upon it, and could make not

only the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great order;--but having,

by that time, gone much deeper into the art, than what his first motive

made necessary, my uncle Toby was able to cross the Maes and Sambre; make

diversions as far as Vauban's line, the abbey of Salsines, &c. and give his

visitors as distinct a history of each of their attacks, as of that of the

gate of St. Nicolas, where he had the honour to receive his wound.



But desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the

acquisition of it.  The more my uncle Toby pored over his map, the more he

took a liking to it!--by the same process and electrical assimilation, as I

told you, through which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves, by

long friction and incumbition, have the happiness, at length, to get all

be-virtu'd--be-pictured,--be-butterflied, and be-fiddled.



The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science, the greater

was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so that before the first year of

his confinement had well gone round, there was scarce a fortified town in

Italy or Flanders, of which, by one means or other, he had not procured a

plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully collating therewith the

histories of their sieges, their demolitions, their improvements, and new

works, all which he would read with that intense application and delight,

that he would forget himself, his wound, his confinement, his dinner.



In the second year my uncle Toby purchased Ramelli and Cataneo, translated

from the Italian;--likewise Stevinus, Moralis, the Chevalier de Ville,

Lorini, Cochorn, Sheeter, the Count de Pagan, the Marshal Vauban, Mons.

Blondel, with almost as many more books of military architecture, as Don

Quixote was found to have of chivalry, when the curate and barber invaded

his library.



Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in August, ninety-nine,

my uncle Toby found it necessary to understand a little of projectiles:--

and having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the fountain-head, he

began with N. Tartaglia, who it seems was the first man who detected the

imposition of a cannon-ball's doing all that mischief under the notion of a

right line--This N. Tartaglia proved to my uncle Toby to be an impossible

thing.



--Endless is the search of Truth.



No sooner was my uncle Toby satisfied which road the cannon-ball did not

go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved in his mind to enquire and

find out which road the ball did go:  For which purpose he was obliged to

set off afresh with old Maltus, and studied him devoutly.--He proceeded

next to Galileo and Torricellius, wherein, by certain Geometrical rules,

infallibly laid down, he found the precise path to be a Parabola--or else

an Hyperbola,--and that the parameter, or latus rectum, of the conic

section of the said path, was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct

ratio, as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence,

formed by the breech upon an horizontal plane;--and that the

semiparameter,--stop! my dear uncle Toby--stop!--go not one foot farther

into this thorny and bewildered track,--intricate are the steps! intricate

are the mazes of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles which the

pursuit of this bewitching phantom Knowledge will bring upon thee.--O my

uncle;--fly--fly,--fly from it as from a serpent.--Is it fit--goodnatured

man! thou should'st sit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights

baking thy blood with hectic watchings?--Alas! 'twill exasperate thy

symptoms,--check thy perspirations--evaporate thy spirits--waste thy animal

strength, dry up thy radical moisture, bring thee into a costive habit of

body,--impair thy health,--and hasten all the infirmities of thy old age.--

O my uncle! my uncle Toby.





Chapter 1.XXIX.



I would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft, who does

not understand this,--That the best plain narrative in the world, tacked

very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle Toby--would have

felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palate;--therefore I forthwith

put an end to the chapter, though I was in the middle of my story.



--Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters.  Where an

exact copying makes our pictures less striking, we choose the less evil;

deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth, than beauty. 

This is to be understood cum grano salis; but be it as it will,--as the

parallel is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool, than any

thing else,--'tis not very material whether upon any other score the reader

approves of it or not.



In the latter end of the third year, my uncle Toby perceiving that the

parameter and semi-parameter of the conic section angered his wound, he

left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and betook himself

to the practical part of fortification only; the pleasure of which, like a

spring held back, returned upon him with redoubled force.



It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily

regularity of a clean shirt,--to dismiss his barber unshaven,--and to allow

his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound, concerning himself

so little about it, as not to ask him once in seven times dressing, how it

went on:  when, lo!--all of a sudden, for the change was quick as

lightning, he began to sigh heavily for his recovery,--complained to my

father, grew impatient with the surgeon:--and one morning, as he heard his

foot coming up stairs, he shut up his books, and thrust aside his

instruments, in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction of the

cure, which, he told him, might surely have been accomplished at least by

that time:--He dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone, and the

sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonment;--adding, that had it not

been for the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers,--

he had long since sunk under his misfortunes.--My father was by.  My uncle

Toby's eloquence brought tears into his eyes;--'twas unexpected:--My uncle

Toby, by nature was not eloquent;--it had the greater effect:--The surgeon

was confounded;--not that there wanted grounds for such, or greater marks

of impatience,--but 'twas unexpected too; in the four years he had attended

him, he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle Toby's carriage; he

had never once dropped one fretful or discontented word;--he had been all

patience,--all submission.



--We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it;--but we

often treble the force:--The surgeon was astonished; but much more so, when

he heard my uncle Toby go on, and peremptorily insist upon his healing up

the wound directly,--or sending for Monsieur Ronjat, the king's serjeant-

surgeon, to do it for him.



The desire of life and health is implanted in man's nature;--the love of

liberty and enlargement is a sister-passion to it:  These my uncle Toby had

in common with his species--and either of them had been sufficient to

account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors;--but I have

told you before, that nothing wrought with our family after the common

way;--and from the time and manner in which this eager desire shewed itself

in the present case, the penetrating reader will suspect there was some

other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle Toby's head:--There was so, and

'tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and

crotchet was.  I own, when that's done, 'twill be time to return back to

the parlour fire-side, where we left my uncle Toby in the middle of his

sentence.





Chapter 1.XXX.



When a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion,--or, in

other words, when his Hobby-Horse grows headstrong,--farewell cool reason

and fair discretion!



My uncle Toby's wound was near well, and as soon as the surgeon recovered

his surprize, and could get leave to say as much--he told him, 'twas just

beginning to incarnate; and that if no fresh exfoliation happened, which

there was no sign of,--it would be dried up in five or six weeks.  The

sound of as many Olympiads, twelve hours before, would have conveyed an

idea of shorter duration to my uncle Toby's mind.--The succession of his

ideas was now rapid,--he broiled with impatience to put his design in

execution;--and so, without consulting farther with any soul living,--

which, by the bye, I think is right, when you are predetermined to take no

one soul's advice,--he privately ordered Trim, his man, to pack up a bundle

of lint and dressings, and hire a chariot-and-four to be at the door

exactly by twelve o'clock that day, when he knew my father would be upon

'Change.--So leaving a bank-note upon the table for the surgeon's care of

him, and a letter of tender thanks for his brother's--he packed up his

maps, his books of fortification, his instruments, &c. and by the help of a

crutch on one side, and Trim on the other,--my uncle Toby embarked for

Shandy-Hall.



The reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as follows:



The table in my uncle Toby's room, and at which, the night before this

change happened, he was sitting with his maps, &c. about him--being

somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity of great and small instruments

of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it--he had the accident, in

reaching over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his compasses, and in

stooping to take the compasses up, with his sleeve he threw down his case

of instruments and snuffers;--and as the dice took a run against him, in

his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in falling,--he thrust Monsieur

Blondel off the table, and Count de Pagon o'top of him.



'Twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle Toby was, to think of

redressing these evils by himself,--he rung his bell for his man Trim;--

Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, prithee see what confusion I have here been

making--I must have some better contrivance, Trim.--Can'st not thou take my

rule, and measure the length and breadth of this table, and then go and

bespeak me one as big again?--Yes, an' please your Honour, replied Trim,

making a bow; but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down

to your country-seat, where,--as your Honour takes so much pleasure in

fortification, we could manage this matter to a T.



I must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle Toby's, who went by

the name of Trim, had been a corporal in my uncle's own company,--his real

name was James Butler,--but having got the nick-name of Trim, in the

regiment, my uncle Toby, unless when he happened to be very angry with him,

would never call him by any other name.



The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his left

knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of Landen, which was two years

before the affair of Namur;--and as the fellow was well-beloved in the

regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle Toby took him for

his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending my uncle Toby in the

camp and in his quarters as a valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster, and

nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with

great fidelity and affection.



My uncle Toby loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him

still, was the similitude of their knowledge.--For Corporal Trim, (for so,

for the future, I shall call him) by four years occasional attention to his

Master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of prying and

peeping continually into his Master's plans, &c. exclusive and besides what

he gained Hobby-Horsically, as a body-servant, Non Hobby Horsical per se;--

had become no mean proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook

and chamber-maid, to know as much of the nature of strong-holds as my uncle

Toby himself.



I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal Trim's character,--

and it is the only dark line in it.--The fellow loved to advise,--or rather

to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful,

'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue a-

going,--you had no hold of him--he was voluble;--the eternal interlardings

of your Honour, with the respectfulness of Corporal Trim's manner,

interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution,--that though you might

have been incommoded,--you could not well be angry.  My uncle Toby was

seldom either the one or the other with him,--or, at least, this fault, in

Trim, broke no squares with them.  My uncle Toby, as I said, loved the

man;--and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant,--but as an

humble friend,--he could not bear to stop his mouth.--Such was Corporal

Trim.



If I durst presume, continued Trim, to give your Honour my advice, and

speak my opinion in this matter.--Thou art welcome, Trim, quoth my uncle

Toby--speak,--speak what thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without

fear.--Why then, replied Trim, (not hanging his ears and scratching his

head like a country-lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead,

and standing erect as before his division,--I think, quoth Trim, advancing

his left, which was his lame leg, a little forwards,--and pointing with his

right hand open towards a map of Dunkirk, which was pinned against the

hangings,--I think, quoth Corporal Trim, with humble submission to your

Honour's better judgment,--that these ravelins, bastions, curtins, and

hornworks, make but a poor, contemptible, fiddle-faddle piece of work of it

here upon paper, compared to what your Honour and I could make of it were

we in the country by ourselves, and had but a rood, or a rood and a half of

ground to do what we pleased with:  As summer is coming on, continued Trim,

your Honour might sit out of doors, and give me the nography--(Call it

ichnography, quoth my uncle,)--of the town or citadel, your Honour was

pleased to sit down before,--and I will be shot by your Honour upon the

glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your Honour's mind.--I dare say

thou would'st, Trim, quoth my uncle.--For if your Honour, continued the

Corporal, could but mark me the polygon, with its exact lines and angles--

That I could do very well, quoth my uncle.--I would begin with the fosse,

and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth--I can to a

hair's breadth, Trim, replied my uncle.--I would throw out the earth upon

this hand towards the town for the scarp,--and on that hand towards the

campaign for the counterscarp.--Very right, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby:--And

when I had sloped them to your mind,--and' please your Honour, I would face

the glacis, as the finest fortifications are done in Flanders, with sods,--

and as your Honour knows they should be,--and I would make the walls and

parapets with sods too.--The best engineers call them gazons, Trim, said my

uncle Toby.--Whether they are gazons or sods, is not much matter, replied

Trim; your Honour knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick

or stone.--I know they are, Trim in some respects,--quoth my uncle Toby,

nodding his head;--for a cannon-ball enters into the gazon right onwards,

without bringing any rubbish down with it, which might fill the fosse, (as

was the case at St. Nicolas's gate) and facilitate the passage over it.



Your Honour understands these matters, replied Corporal Trim, better than

any officer in his Majesty's service;--but would your Honour please to let

the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the country, I

would work under your Honour's directions like a horse, and make

fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their batteries,

saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world's

riding twenty miles to go and see it.



My uncle Toby blushed as red as scarlet as Trim went on;--but it was not a

blush of guilt,--of modesty,--or of anger,--it was a blush of joy;--he was

fired with Corporal Trim's project and description.--Trim! said my uncle

Toby, thou hast said enough.--We might begin the campaign, continued Trim,

on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the field, and

demolish them town by town as fast as--Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, say no

more.  Your Honour, continued Trim, might sit in your arm-chair (pointing

to it) this fine weather, giving me your orders, and I would--Say no more,

Trim, quoth my uncle Toby--Besides, your Honour would get not only pleasure

and good pastime--but good air, and good exercise, and good health,--and

your Honour's wound would be well in a month.  Thou hast said enough,

Trim,--quoth my uncle Toby (putting his hand into his breeches-pocket)--I

like thy project mightily.--And if your Honour pleases, I'll this moment go

and buy a pioneer's spade to take down with us, and I'll bespeak a shovel

and a pick-axe, and a couple of--Say no more, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,

leaping up upon one leg, quite overcome with rapture,--and thrusting a

guinea into Trim's hand,--Trim, said my uncle Toby, say no more;--but go

down, Trim, this moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this instant.



Trim ran down and brought up his master's supper,--to no purpose:--Trim's

plan of operation ran so in my uncle Toby's head, he could not taste it.--

Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, get me to bed.--'Twas all one.--Corporal Trim's

description had fired his imagination,--my uncle Toby could not shut his

eyes.--The more he considered it, the more bewitching the scene appeared to

him;--so that, two full hours before day-light, he had come to a final

determination and had concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal Trim's

decampment.



My uncle Toby had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village

where my father's estate lay at Shandy, which had been left him by an old

uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a-year.  Behind this

house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre,

and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge,

was a bowling-green, containing just about as much ground as Corporal Trim

wished for;--so that as Trim uttered the words, 'A rood and a half of

ground to do what they would with,'--this identical bowling-green instantly

presented itself, and became curiously painted all at once, upon the retina

of my uncle Toby's fancy;--which was the physical cause of making him

change colour, or at least of heightening his blush, to that immoderate

degree I spoke of.



Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and

expectation, than my uncle Toby did, to enjoy this self-same thing in

private;--I say in private;--for it was sheltered from the house, as I told

you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three sides, from

mortal sight, by rough holly and thick-set flowering shrubs:--so that the

idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure

pre-conceived in my uncle Toby's mind.--Vain thought! however thick it was

planted about,--or private soever it might seem,--to think, dear uncle

Toby, of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground,-

-and not have it known!



How my uncle Toby and Corporal Trim managed this matter,--with the history

of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,--may make no

uninteresting under-plot in the epitasis and working-up of this drama.--At

present the scene must drop,--and change for the parlour fire-side.





Chapter 1.XXXI.



--What can they be doing? brother, said my father.--I think, replied my

uncle Toby,--taking, as I told you, his pipe from his mouth, and striking

the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;--I think, replied he,--it

would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.



Pray, what's all that racket over our heads, Obadiah?--quoth my father;--my

brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak.



Sir, answered Obadiah, making a bow towards his left shoulder,--my Mistress

is taken very badly.--And where's Susannah running down the garden there,

as if they were going to ravish her?--Sir, she is running the shortest cut

into the town, replied Obadiah, to fetch the old midwife.--Then saddle a

horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly for Dr. Slop, the man-

midwife, with all our services,--and let him know your mistress is fallen

into labour--and that I desire he will return with you with all speed.



It is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle Toby, as

Obadiah shut the door,--as there is so expert an operator as Dr. Slop so

near,--that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate

humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one

misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old woman;--and not only the

life of my child, brother,--but her own life, and with it the lives of all

the children I might, peradventure, have begot out of her hereafter.



Mayhap, brother, replied my uncle Toby, my sister does it to save the

expence:--A pudding's end,--replied my father,--the Doctor must be paid the

same for inaction as action,--if not better,--to keep him in temper.



--Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world, quoth my uncle Toby, in

the simplicity of his heart,--but Modesty.--My sister, I dare say, added

he, does not care to let a man come so near her. . ..  I will not say

whether my uncle Toby had completed the sentence or not;--'tis for his

advantage to suppose he had,--as, I think, he could have added no One Word

which would have improved it.



If, on the contrary, my uncle Toby had not fully arrived at the period's

end--then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my father's

tobacco-pipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in

oratory, which Rhetoricians stile the Aposiopesis.--Just Heaven! how does

the Poco piu and the Poco meno of the Italian artists;--the insensible more

or less, determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence, as well as

in the statue!  How do the slight touches of the chisel, the pencil, the

pen, the fiddle-stick, et caetera,--give the true swell, which gives the

true pleasure!--O my countrymen:--be nice; be cautious of your language;

and never, O! never let it be forgotten upon what small particles your

eloquence and your fame depend.



--'My sister, mayhap,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'does not choose to let a man

come so near her. . ..'  Make this dash,--'tis an Aposiopesis,--Take the

dash away, and write Backside,--'tis Bawdy.--Scratch Backside out, and put

Cover'd way in, 'tis a Metaphor;--and, I dare say, as fortification ran so

much in my uncle Toby's head, that if he had been left to have added one

word to the sentence,--that word was it.



But whether that was the case or not the case;--or whether the snapping of

my father's tobacco-pipe, so critically, happened through accident or

anger, will be seen in due time.





Chapter 1.XXXII.



Tho' my father was a good natural philosopher,--yet he was something of a

moral philosopher too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe snapp'd

short in the middle,--he had nothing to do, as such, but to have taken hold

of the two pieces, and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire.--He

did no such thing;--he threw them with all the violence in the world;--and,

to give the action still more emphasis,--he started upon both his legs to

do it.



This looked something like heat;--and the manner of his reply to what my

uncle Toby was saying, proved it was so.



--'Not choose,' quoth my father, (repeating my uncle Toby's words) 'to let

a man come so near her!'--By Heaven, brother Toby! you would try the

patience of Job;--and I think I have the plagues of one already without

it.--Why?--Where?--Wherein?--Wherefore?--Upon what account? replied my

uncle Toby: in the utmost astonishment.--To think, said my father, of a man

living to your age, brother, and knowing so little about women!--I know

nothing at all about them,--replied my uncle Toby:  And I think, continued

he, that the shock I received the year after the demolition of Dunkirk, in

my affair with widow Wadman;--which shock you know I should not have

received, but from my total ignorance of the sex,--has given me just cause

to say, That I neither know nor do pretend to know any thing about 'em or

their concerns either.--Methinks, brother, replied my father, you might, at

least, know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong.



It is said in Aristotle's Master Piece, 'That when a man doth think of any

thing which is past,--he looketh down upon the ground;--but that when he

thinketh of something that is to come, he looketh up towards the heavens.'



My uncle Toby, I suppose, thought of neither, for he look'd horizontally.--

Right end! quoth my uncle Toby, muttering the two words low to himself, and

fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them, upon a small crevice,

formed by a bad joint in the chimney-piece--Right end of a woman!--I

declare, quoth my uncle, I know no more which it is than the man in the

moon;--and if I was to think, continued my uncle Toby (keeping his eyes

still fixed upon the bad joint) this month together, I am sure I should not

be able to find it out.



Then, brother Toby, replied my father, I will tell you.



Every thing in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh pipe)--

every thing in this world, my dear brother Toby, has two handles.--Not

always, quoth my uncle Toby.--At least, replied my father, every one has

two hands,--which comes to the same thing.--Now, if a man was to sit down

coolly, and consider within himself the make, the shape, the construction,

come-at-ability, and convenience of all the parts which constitute the

whole of that animal, called Woman, and compare them analogically--I never

understood rightly the meaning of that word,--quoth my uncle Toby.--



Analogy, replied my father, is the certain relation and agreement which

different--Here a devil of a rap at the door snapped my father's definition

(like his tobacco-pipe) in two,--and, at the same time, crushed the head of

as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was engendered in the womb of

speculation;--it was some months before my father could get an opportunity

to be safely delivered of it:--And, at this hour, it is a thing full as

problematical as the subject of the dissertation itself,--(considering the


confusion and distresses of our domestick misadventures, which are now

coming thick one upon the back of another) whether I shall be able to find

a place for it in the third volume or not.





Chapter 1.XXXIII.



It is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle Toby

rung the bell, when Obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse, and go for Dr.

Slop, the man-midwife;--so that no one can say, with reason, that I have

not allowed Obadiah time enough, poetically speaking, and considering the

emergency too, both to go and come;--though, morally and truly speaking,

the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots.



If the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all to take a

pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell,

and the rap at the door;--and, after finding it to be no more than two

minutes, thirteen seconds, and three-fifths,--should take upon him to

insult over me for such a breach in the unity, or rather probability of

time;--I would remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its simple

modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our ideas--and is the

true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar, I will be tried in

this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other

pendulums whatever.



I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles

from Shandy-Hall to Dr. Slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst

Obadiah has been going those said miles and back, I have brought my uncle

Toby from Namur, quite across all Flanders, into England:--That I have had

him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since travelled him and

Corporal Trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near two hundred miles

down into Yorkshire.--all which put together, must have prepared the

reader's imagination for the entrance of Dr. Slop upon the stage,--as much,

at least (I hope) as a dance, a song, or a concerto between the acts.



If my hypercritick is intractable, alledging, that two minutes and thirteen

seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen seconds,--when I have

said all I can about them; and that this plea, though it might save me

dramatically, will damn me biographically, rendering my book from this very

moment, a professed Romance, which, before, was a book apocryphal:--If I am

thus pressed--I then put an end to the whole objection and controversy

about it all at once,--by acquainting him, that Obadiah had not got above

threescore yards from the stable-yard, before he met with Dr. Slop;--and

indeed he gave a dirty proof that he had met with him, and was within an

ace of giving a tragical one too.



Imagine to yourself;--but this had better begin a new chapter.





Chapter 1.XXXIV.



Imagine to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure of a Doctor Slop, of

about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back,

and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant

in the horse-guards.



Such were the out-lines of Dr. Slop's figure, which--if you have read

Hogarth's analysis of beauty, and if you have not, I wish you would;--you

must know, may as certainly be caricatured, and conveyed to the mind by

three strokes as three hundred.



Imagine such a one,--for such, I say, were the outlines of Dr. Slop's

figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling thro' the dirt upon the

vertebrae of a little diminutive pony, of a pretty colour--but of

strength,--alack!--scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such a

fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition.--They were not.--

Imagine to yourself, Obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of a coach-

horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable speed the

adverse way.



Pray, Sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.



Had Dr. Slop beheld Obadiah a mile off, posting in a narrow lane directly

towards him, at that monstrous rate,--splashing and plunging like a devil

thro' thick and thin, as he approached, would not such a phaenomenon, with

such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it, round its axis,--have

been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr. Slop in his situation, than

the worst of Whiston's comets?--To say nothing of the Nucleus; that is, of

Obadiah and the coach-horse.--In my idea, the vortex alone of 'em was

enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at least the

doctor's pony, quite away with it.  What then do you think must the terror

and hydrophobia of Dr. Slop have been, when you read (which you are just

going to do) that he was advancing thus warily along towards Shandy-Hall,

and had approached to within sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a

sudden turn, made by an acute angle of the garden-wall,--and in the

dirtiest part of a dirty lane,--when Obadiah and his coach-horse turned the

corner, rapid, furious,--pop,--full upon him!--Nothing, I think, in nature,

can be supposed more terrible than such a rencounter,--so imprompt! so ill

prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr. Slop was.



What could Dr. Slop do?--he crossed himself + --Pugh!--but the doctor, Sir,

was a Papist.--No matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel.--He

had so;--nay, as it happened, he had better have done nothing at all; for

in crossing himself he let go his whip,--and in attempting to save his whip

betwixt his knee and his saddle's skirt, as it slipped, he lost his

stirrup,--in losing which he lost his seat;--and in the multitude of all

these losses (which, by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in

crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind.  So that

without waiting for Obadiah's onset, he left his pony to its destiny,

tumbling off it diagonally, something in the stile and manner of a pack of

wool, and without any other consequence from the fall, save that of being

left (as it would have been) with the broadest part of him sunk about

twelve inches deep in the mire.



Obadiah pull'd off his cap twice to Dr. Slop;--once as he was falling,--and

then again when he saw him seated.--Ill-timed complaisance;--had not the

fellow better have stopped his horse, and got off and help'd him?--Sir, he

did all that his situation would allow;--but the Momentum of the coach-

horse was so great, that Obadiah could not do it all at once; he rode in a

circle three times round Dr. Slop, before he could fully accomplish it any

how;--and at the last, when he did stop his beast, 'twas done with such an

explosion of mud, that Obadiah had better have been a league off.  In

short, never was a Dr. Slop so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since

that affair came into fashion.





Chapter 1.XXXV.



When Dr. Slop entered the back parlour, where my father and my uncle Toby

were discoursing upon the nature of women,--it was hard to determine

whether Dr. Slop's figure, or Dr. Slop's presence, occasioned more surprize

to them; for as the accident happened so near the house, as not to make it

worth while for Obadiah to remount him,--Obadiah had led him in as he was,

unwiped, unappointed, unannealed, with all his stains and blotches on him.-

-He stood like Hamlet's ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full minute

and a half at the parlour-door (Obadiah still holding his hand) with all

the majesty of mud.  His hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall,

totally besmeared,--and in every other part of him, blotched over in such a

manner with Obadiah's explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental

reservation) that every grain of it had taken effect.



Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumphed over my

father in his turn;--for no mortal, who had beheld Dr. Slop in that pickle,

could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle Toby's opinion,

'That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a Dr. Slop come so near

her. . ..'  But it was the Argumentum ad hominem; and if my uncle Toby was

not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care to use it.--No; the

reason was,--'twas not his nature to insult.



Dr. Slop's presence at that time, was no less problematical than the mode

of it; tho' it is certain, one moment's reflexion in my father might have

solved it; for he had apprized Dr. Slop but the week before, that my mother

was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard nothing since, 'twas

natural and very political too in him, to have taken a ride to Shandy-Hall,

as he did, merely to see how matters went on.



But my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation;

running, like the hypercritick's, altogether upon the ringing of the bell

and the rap upon the door,--measuring their distance, and keeping his mind

so intent upon the operation, as to have power to think of nothing else,--

common-place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians! working with might

and main at the demonstration, and so wasting all their strength upon it,

that they have none left in them to draw the corollary, to do good with.



The ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck likewise strong

upon the sensorium of my uncle Toby,--but it excited a very different train

of thoughts;--the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought

Stevinus, the great engineer, along with them, into my uncle Toby's mind. 

What business Stevinus had in this affair,--is the greatest problem of

all:--It shall be solved,--but not in the next chapter.





Chapter 1.XXXVI.



Writing, when properly managed (as you may be sure I think mine is) is but

a different name for conversation.  As no one, who knows what he is about

in good company, would venture to talk all;--so no author, who understands

the just boundaries of decorum and good-breeding, would presume to think

all:  The truest respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding,

is to halve this matter amicably, and leave him something to imagine, in

his turn, as well as yourself.



For my own part, I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind, and do

all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own.



'Tis his turn now;--I have given an ample description of Dr. Slop's sad

overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the back-parlour;--his imagination

must now go on with it for a while.



Let the reader imagine then, that Dr. Slop has told his tale--and in what

words, and with what aggravations, his fancy chooses;--Let him suppose,

that Obadiah has told his tale also, and with such rueful looks of affected

concern, as he thinks best will contrast the two figures as they stand by

each other.--Let him imagine, that my father has stepped up stairs to see

my mother.--And, to conclude this work of imagination,--let him imagine the

doctor washed,--rubbed down, and condoled,--felicitated,--got into a pair

of Obadiah's pumps, stepping forwards towards the door, upon the very point

of entering upon action.



Truce!--truce, good Dr. Slop!--stay thy obstetrick hand;--return it safe

into thy bosom to keep it warm;--little dost thou know what obstacles,--

little dost thou think what hidden causes, retard its operation!--Hast

thou, Dr. Slop,--hast thou been entrusted with the secret articles of the

solemn treaty which has brought thee into this place?--Art thou aware that

at this instant, a daughter of Lucina is put obstetrically over thy head? 

Alas!--'tis too true.--Besides, great son of Pilumnus! what canst thou do?-

-Thou hast come forth unarm'd;--thou hast left thy tire-tete,--thy new-

invented forceps,--thy crotchet,--thy squirt, and all thy instruments of

salvation and deliverance, behind thee,--By Heaven! at this moment they are

hanging up in a green bays bag, betwixt thy two pistols, at the bed's

head!--Ring;--call;--send Obadiah back upon the coach-horse to bring them

with all speed.  



--Make great haste, Obadiah, quoth my father, and I'll give thee a crown!

and quoth my uncle Toby, I'll give you another.





Chapter 1.XXXVII.



Your sudden and unexpected arrival, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself

to Dr. Slop, (all three of them sitting down to the fire together, as my

uncle Toby began to speak)--instantly brought the great Stevinus into my

head, who, you must know, is a favourite author with me.--Then, added my

father, making use of the argument Ad Crumenam,--I will lay twenty guineas

to a single crown-piece (which will serve to give away to Obadiah when he

gets back) that this same Stevinus was some engineer or other--or has wrote

something or other, either directly or indirectly, upon the science of

fortification.



He has so,--replied my uncle Toby.--I knew it, said my father, though, for

the soul of me, I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt

Dr. Slop's sudden coming, and a discourse upon fortification;--yet I fear'd

it.--Talk of what we will, brother,--or let the occasion be never so

foreign or unfit for the subject,--you are sure to bring it in.  I would

not, brother Toby, continued my father,--I declare I would not have my head

so full of curtins and horn-works.--That I dare say you would not, quoth

Dr. Slop, interrupting him, and laughing most immoderately at his pun.



Dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation of a

pun, more cordially than my father;--he would grow testy upon it at any

time;--but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was as bad,

he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;--he saw no difference.



Sir, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Dr. Slop,--the curtins my

brother Shandy mentions here, have nothing to do with beadsteads;--tho', I

know Du Cange says, 'That bed-curtains, in all probability, have taken

their name from them;'--nor have the horn-works he speaks of, any thing in

the world to do with the horn-works of cuckoldom:  But the Curtin, Sir, is

the word we use in fortification, for that part of the wall or rampart

which lies between the two bastions and joins them--Besiegers seldom offer

to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin, for this reason,

because they are so well flanked.  ('Tis the case of other curtains, quoth

Dr. Slop, laughing.)  However, continued my uncle Toby, to make them sure,

we generally choose to place ravelins before them, taking care only to

extend them beyond the fosse or ditch:--The common men, who know very

little of fortification, confound the ravelin and the half-moon together,--

tho' they are very different things;--not in their figure or construction,

for we make them exactly alike, in all points; for they always consist of

two faces, making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in

form of a crescent;--Where then lies the difference? (quoth my father, a

little testily.)--In their situations, answered my uncle Toby:--For when a

ravelin, brother, stands before the curtin, it is a ravelin; and when a

ravelin stands before a bastion, then the ravelin is not a ravelin;--it is

a half-moon;--a half-moon likewise is a half-moon, and no more, so long as

it stands before its bastion;--but was it to change place, and get before

the curtin,--'twould be no longer a half-moon; a half-moon, in that case,

is not a half-moon;--'tis no more than a ravelin.--I think, quoth my

father, that the noble science of defence has its weak sides--as well as

others. 



As for the horn-work (high! ho! sigh'd my father) which, continued my uncle

Toby, my brother was speaking of, they are a very considerable part of an

outwork;--they are called by the French engineers, Ouvrage a corne, and we

generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than

the rest;--'tis formed by two epaulments or demi-bastions--they are very

pretty,--and if you will take a walk, I'll engage to shew you one well

worth your trouble.--I own, continued my uncle Toby, when we crown them,--

they are much stronger, but then they are very expensive, and take up a

great deal of ground, so that, in my opinion, they are most of use to cover

or defend the head of a camp; otherwise the double tenaille--By the mother

who bore us!--brother Toby, quoth my father, not able to hold out any

longer,--you would provoke a saint;--here have you got us, I know not how,

not only souse into the middle of the old subject again:--But so full is

your head of these confounded works, that though my wife is this moment in

the pains of labour, and you hear her cry out, yet nothing will serve you

but to carry off the man-midwife.--Accoucheur,--if you please, quoth Dr.

Slop.--With all my heart, replied my father, I don't care what they call

you,--but I wish the whole science of fortification, with all its

inventors, at the devil;--it has been the death of thousands,--and it will

be mine in the end.--I would not, I would not, brother Toby, have my brains

so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, pallisadoes, ravelins, half-moons,

and such trumpery, to be proprietor of Namur, and of all the towns in

Flanders with it.



My uncle Toby was a man patient of injuries;--not from want of courage,--I

have told you in a former chapter, 'that he was a man of courage:'--And

will add here, that where just occasions presented, or called it forth,--I

know no man under whose arm I would have sooner taken shelter;--nor did

this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts;-

-for he felt this insult of my father's as feelingly as a man could do;--

but he was of a peaceful, placid nature,--no jarring element in it,--all

was mixed up so kindly within him; my uncle Toby had scarce a heart to

retaliate upon a fly.



--Go--says he, one day at dinner, to an over-grown one which had buzzed

about his nose, and tormented him cruelly all dinner-time,--and which after

infinite attempts, he had caught at last, as it flew by him;--I'll not hurt

thee, says my uncle Toby, rising from his chair, and going across the room,

with the fly in his hand,--I'll not hurt a hair of thy head:--Go, says he,

lifting up the sash, and opening his hand as he spoke, to let it escape;--

go, poor devil, get thee gone, why should I hurt thee?--This world surely

is wide enough to hold both thee and me.



I was but ten years old when this happened:  but whether it was, that the

action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity, which

instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of most pleasurable

sensation;--or how far the manner and expression of it might go towards

it;--or in what degree, or by what secret magick,--a tone of voice and

harmony of movement, attuned by mercy, might find a passage to my heart, I

know not;--this I know, that the lesson of universal good-will then taught

and imprinted by my uncle Toby, has never since been worn out of my mind: 

And tho' I would not depreciate what the study of the Literae humaniores,

at the university, have done for me in that respect, or discredit the other

helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me, both at home and abroad

since;--yet I often think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that

one accidental impression.



This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume upon

the subject.



I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle Toby's picture, by the

instrument with which I drew the other parts of it,--that taking in no more

than the mere Hobby-Horsical likeness:--this is a part of his moral

character.  My father, in this patient endurance of wrongs, which I

mention, was very different, as the reader must long ago have noted; he had

a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature, attended with a little

soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing which

looked like malignancy:--yet in the little rubs and vexations of life,

'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness:--He

was, however, frank and generous in his nature;--at all times open to

conviction; and in the little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards

others, but particularly towards my uncle Toby, whom he truly loved:--he

would feel more pain, ten times told (except in the affair of my aunt

Dinah, or where an hypothesis was concerned) than what he ever gave.



The characters of the two brothers, in this view of them, reflected light

upon each other, and appeared with great advantage in this affair which

arose about Stevinus.



I need not tell the reader, if he keeps a Hobby-Horse,--that a man's Hobby-

Horse is as tender a part as he has about him; and that these unprovoked

strokes at my uncle Toby's could not be unfelt by him.--No:--as I said

above, my uncle Toby did feel them, and very sensibly too.



Pray, Sir, what said he?--How did he behave?--O, Sir!--it was great:  For

as soon as my father had done insulting his Hobby-Horse,--he turned his

head without the least emotion, from Dr. Slop, to whom he was addressing

his discourse, and looking up into my father's face, with a countenance

spread over with so much good-nature;--so placid;--so fraternal;--so

inexpressibly tender towards him:--it penetrated my father to his heart: 

He rose up hastily from his chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle Toby's

hands as he spoke:--Brother Toby, said he:--I beg thy pardon;--forgive, I

pray thee, this rash humour which my mother gave me.--My dear, dear

brother, answered my uncle Toby, rising up by my father's help, say no more

about it;--you are heartily welcome, had it been ten times as much,

brother.  But 'tis ungenerous, replied my father, to hurt any man;--a

brother worse;--but to hurt a brother of such gentle manners,--so

unprovoking,--and so unresenting;--'tis base:--By Heaven, 'tis cowardly.--

You are heartily welcome, brother, quoth my uncle Toby,--had it been fifty

times as much.--Besides, what have I to do, my dear Toby, cried my father,

either with your amusements or your pleasures, unless it was in my power

(which it is not) to increase their measure?



--Brother Shandy, answered my uncle Toby, looking wistfully in his face,--

you are much mistaken in this point:--for you do increase my pleasure very

much, in begetting children for the Shandy family at your time of life.--

But, by that, Sir, quoth Dr. Slop, Mr. Shandy increases his own.--Not a

jot, quoth my father.





Chapter 1.XXXVIII.



My brother does it, quoth my uncle Toby, out of principle.--In a family

way, I suppose, quoth Dr. Slop.--Pshaw!--said my father,--'tis not worth

talking of.





Chapter 1.XXXIX.



At the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle Toby were left both

standing, like Brutus and Cassius, at the close of the scene, making up

their accounts.



As my father spoke the three last words,--he sat down;--my uncle Toby

exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung

the bell, to order Corporal Trim, who was in waiting, to step home for

Stevinus:--my uncle Toby's house being no farther off than the opposite

side of the way.



Some men would have dropped the subject of Stevinus;--but my uncle Toby had

no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my

father that he had none.



Your sudden appearance, Dr. Slop, quoth my uncle, resuming the discourse,

instantly brought Stevinus into my head.  (My father, you may be sure, did

not offer to lay any more wagers upon Stevinus's head.)--Because, continued

my uncle Toby, the celebrated sailing chariot, which belonged to Prince

Maurice, and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry

half a dozen people thirty German miles, in I don't know how few minutes,--

was invented by Stevinus, that great mathematician and engineer.



You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr. Slop (as the

fellow is lame) of going for Stevinus's account of it, because in my return

from Leyden thro' the Hague, I walked as far as Schevling, which is two

long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.



That's nothing, replied my uncle Toby, to what the learned Peireskius did,

who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from Paris to

Schevling, and from Schevling to Paris back again, in order to see it, and

nothing else.



Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.



The more fool Peireskius, replied Dr. Slop.  But mark, 'twas out of no

contempt of Peireskius at all;--but that Peireskius's indefatigable labour

in trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced the

exploit of Dr. Slop, in that affair, to nothing:--the more fool Peireskius,

said he again.--Why so?--replied my father, taking his brother's part, not

only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given

him, which sat still upon my father's mind;--but partly, that my father

began really to interest himself in the discourse.--Why so?--said he.  Why

is Peireskius, or any man else, to be abused for an appetite for that, or

any other morsel of sound knowledge:  For notwithstanding I know nothing of

the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a

very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon what principles of

philosophy he has atchieved it;--yet certainly his machine has been

constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it could not have

answered at the rate my brother mentions.



It answered, replied my uncle Toby, as well, if not better; for, as

Peireskius elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion,

Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus; which, unless I have forgot my Latin, is,

that it was as swift as the wind itself.



But pray, Dr. Slop, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not

without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what principles was

this self-same chariot set a-going?--Upon very pretty principles to be

sure, replied Dr. Slop:--And I have often wondered, continued he, evading

the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains like this

of ours,--(especially they whose wives are not past child-bearing) attempt

nothing of this kind; for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon

sudden calls, to which the sex is subject,--if the wind only served,--but

would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost

nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take

'em) both cost and eat a great deal.



For that very reason, replied my father, 'Because they cost nothing, and

because they eat nothing,'--the scheme is bad;--it is the consumption of

our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to the

hungry, circulates trade,--brings in money, and supports the value of our

lands;--and tho', I own, if I was a Prince, I would generously recompense

the scientifick head which brought forth such contrivances;--yet I would as

peremptorily suppress the use of them.



My father here had got into his element,--and was going on as prosperously

with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle Toby had before, upon his of

fortification;--but to the loss of much sound knowledge, the destinies in

the morning had decreed that no dissertation of any kind should be spun by

my father that day,--for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence,





Chapter 1.XL.



In popped Corporal Trim with Stevinus:--But 'twas too late,--all the

discourse had been exhausted without him, and was running into a new

channel.



--You may take the book home again, Trim, said my uncle Toby, nodding to

him.



But prithee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,--look first into it, and

see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it.



Corporal Trim, by being in the service, had learned to obey,--and not to

remonstrate,--so taking the book to a side-table, and running over the

leaves; An' please your Honour, said Trim, I can see no such thing;--

however, continued the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I'll make

sure work of it, an' please your Honour;--so taking hold of the two covers

of the book, one in each hand, and letting the leaves fall down as he bent

the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.



There is something falling out, however, said Trim, an' please your

Honour;--but it is not a chariot, or any thing like one:--Prithee,

Corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it then?--I think, answered

Trim, stooping to take it up,--'tis more like a sermon,--for it begins with

a text of scripture, and the chapter and verse;--and then goes on, not as a

chariot, but like a sermon directly.



The company smiled.



I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle Toby, for such a thing

as a sermon to have got into my Stevinus.



I think 'tis a sermon, replied Trim:--but if it please your Honours, as it

is a fair hand, I will read you a page;--for Trim, you must know, loved to

hear himself read almost as well as talk.



I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things which

cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;--and as we have nothing

better to do, at least till Obadiah gets back, I shall be obliged to you,

brother, if Dr. Slop has no objection to it, to order the Corporal to give

us a page or two of it,--if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing. 

An' please your honour, quoth Trim, I officiated two whole campaigns, in

Flanders, as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment.--He can read it, quoth

my uncle Toby, as well as I can.--Trim, I assure you, was the best scholar

in my company, and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor

fellow's misfortune.  Corporal Trim laid his hand upon his heart, and made

an humble bow to his master; then laying down his hat upon the floor, and

taking up the sermon in his left hand, in order to have his right at

liberty,--he advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where

he could best see, and be best seen by his audience.





Chapter 1.XLI.



--If you have any objection,--said my father, addressing himself to Dr.

Slop.  Not in the least, replied Dr. Slop;--for it does not appear on which

side of the question it is wrote,--it may be a composition of a divine of

our church, as well as yours,--so that we run equal risques.--'Tis wrote

upon neither side, quoth Trim, for 'tis only upon Conscience, an' please

your Honours.



Trim's reason put his audience into good humour,--all but Dr. Slop, who

turning his head about towards Trim, looked a little angry.



Begin, Trim,--and read distinctly, quoth my father.--I will, an' please

your Honour, replied the Corporal, making a bow, and bespeaking attention

with a slight movement of his right hand.





Chapter 1.XLII.



--But before the Corporal begins, I must first give you a description of

his attitude;--otherwise he will naturally stand represented, by your

imagination, in an uneasy posture,--stiff,--perpendicular,--dividing the

weight of his body equally upon both legs;--his eye fixed, as if on duty;--

his look determined,--clenching the sermon in his left hand, like his

firelock.--In a word, you would be apt to paint Trim, as if he was standing

in his platoon ready for action,--His attitude was as unlike all this as

you can conceive.



He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards just so far,

as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the

horizon;--which sound orators, to whom I address this, know very well to be

the true persuasive angle of incidence;--in any other angle you may talk

and preach;--'tis certain;--and it is done every day;--but with what

effect,--I leave the world to judge!



The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a

mathematical exactness,--does it not shew us, by the way, how the arts and

sciences mutually befriend each other?



How the duce Corporal Trim, who knew not so much as an acute angle from an

obtuse one, came to hit it so exactly;--or whether it was chance or nature,

or good sense or imitation, &c. shall be commented upon in that part of the

cyclopaedia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental parts of the

eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, and the bar, the coffee-house, the

bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under consideration.



He stood,--for I repeat it, to take the picture of him in at one view, with

his body swayed, and somewhat bent forwards,--his right leg from under him,

sustaining seven-eighths of his whole weight,--the foot of his left leg,

the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude, advanced a

little,--not laterally, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt them;--his knee

bent, but that not violently,--but so as to fall within the limits of the

line of beauty;--and I add, of the line of science too;--for consider, it

had one eighth part of his body to bear up;--so that in this case the

position of the leg is determined,--because the foot could be no farther

advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow him, mechanically to

receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it, and to carry it too.



>This I recommend to painters;--need I add,--to orators!--I think not; for

unless they practise it,--they must fall upon their noses.



So much for Corporal Trim's body and legs.--He held the sermon loosely, not

carelessly, in his left hand, raised something above his stomach, and

detached a little from his breast;--his right arm falling negligently by

his side, as nature and the laws of gravity ordered it,--but with the palm

of it open and turned towards his audience, ready to aid the sentiment in

case it stood in need.



Corporal Trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with

the other parts of him;--he looked frank,--unconstrained,--something

assured,--but not bordering upon assurance.



Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all this.--I've told

him it should be explained;--but so he stood before my father, my uncle

Toby, and Dr. Slop,--so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs, and with

such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,--a statuary might

have modelled from it;--nay, I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a

College,--or the Hebrew Professor himself, could have much mended it.



Trim made a bow, and read as follows:



The Sermon.



Hebrews xiii. 18.



--For we trust we have a good Conscience.



'Trust!--Trust we have a good conscience!'



(Certainly, Trim, quoth my father, interrupting him, you give that sentence

a very improper accent; for you curl up your nose, man, and read it with

such a sneering tone, as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle.



He is, an' please your Honour, replied Trim.  Pugh! said my father,

smiling.



Sir, quoth Dr. Slop, Trim is certainly in the right; for the writer (who I

perceive is a Protestant) by the snappish manner in which he takes up the

apostle, is certainly going to abuse him;--if this treatment of him has not

done it already.  But from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so

soon, Dr. Slop, that the writer is of our church?--for aught I can see

yet,--he may be of any church.--Because, answered Dr. Slop, if he was of

ours,--he durst no more take such a licence,--than a bear by his beard:--

If, in our communion, Sir, a man was to insult an apostle,--a saint,--or

even the paring of a saint's nail,--he would have his eyes scratched out.--

What, by the saint? quoth my uncle Toby.  No, replied Dr. Slop, he would

have an old house over his head.  Pray is the Inquisition an ancient

building, answered my uncle Toby, or is it a modern one?--I know nothing of

architecture, replied Dr. Slop.--An' please your Honours, quoth Trim, the

Inquisition is the vilest--Prithee spare thy description, Trim, I hate the

very name of it, said my father.--No matter for that, answered Dr. Slop,--

it has its uses; for tho' I'm no great advocate for it, yet, in such a case

as this, he would soon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he

went on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains. 

God help him then, quoth my uncle Toby.  Amen, added Trim; for Heaven above

knows, I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it.--

I never heard one word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily:--How came

he there, Trim?--O, Sir, the story will make your heart bleed,--as it has

made mine a thousand times;--but it is too long to be told now;--your

Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside

you in our fortifications;--but the short of the story is this;--That my

brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbon,--and then married a Jew's widow,

who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which somehow or other, was the

cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where

he was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried directly to

the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued Trim, fetching a sigh from

the bottom of his heart,--the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour;

he was as honest a soul, added Trim, (pulling out his handkerchief) as ever

blood warmed.--



--The tears trickled down Trim's cheeks faster than he could well wipe them

away.--A dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes.--Certain proof

of pity!



Come Trim, quoth my father, after he saw the poor fellow's grief had got a

little vent,--read on,--and put this melancholy story out of thy head:--I

grieve that I interrupted thee; but prithee begin the sermon again;--for if

the first sentence in it is matter of abuse, as thou sayest, I have a great

desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given.



Corporal Trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into his

pocket, and, making a bow as he did it,--he began again.)



The Sermon.



Hebrews xiii. 18.



--For we trust we have a good Conscience.--



'Trust! trust we have a good conscience!  Surely if there is any thing in

this life which a man may depend upon, and to the knowledge of which he is

capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence, it must be this

very thing,--whether he has a good conscience or no.'



(I am positive I am right, quoth Dr. Slop.)



'If a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of

this account:--he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires;--he must

remember his past pursuits, and know certainly the true springs and

motives, which, in general, have governed the actions of his life.'



(I defy him, without an assistant, quoth Dr. Slop.)



'In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances; and, as the wise

man complains, hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the

earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us.  But here

the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself;--is conscious of

the web she has wove;--knows its texture and fineness, and the exact share

which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which

virtue or vice has planned before her.'



(The language is good, and I declare Trim reads very well, quoth my

father.)



'Now,--as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has

within herself of this; and the judgment, either of approbation or censure,

which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives; 'tis

plain you will say, from the very terms of the proposition,--whenever this

inward testimony goes against a man, and he stands self-accused, that he

must necessarily be a guilty man.--And, on the contrary, when the report is

favourable on his side, and his heart condemns him not:--that it is not a

matter of trust, as the apostle intimates, but a matter of certainty and

fact, that the conscience is good, and that the man must be good also.'



(Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, I suppose, quoth Dr. Slop,

and the Protestant divine is in the right.  Sir, have patience, replied my

father, for I think it will presently appear that St. Paul and the

Protestant divine are both of an opinion.--As nearly so, quoth Dr. Slop, as

east is to west;--but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes from

the liberty of the press.



It is no more at the worst, replied my uncle Toby, than the liberty of the

pulpit; for it does not appear that the sermon is printed, or ever likely

to be.



Go on, Trim, quoth my father.)



'At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case:  and I make

no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon

the mind of man,--that did no such thing ever happen, as that the

conscience of a man, by long habits of sin, might (as the scripture assures

it may) insensibly become hard;--and, like some tender parts of his body,

by much stress and continual hard usage, lose by degrees that nice sense

and perception with which God and nature endowed it:--Did this never

happen;--or was it certain that self-love could never hang the least bias

upon the judgment;--or that the little interests below could rise up and

perplex the faculties of our upper regions, and encompass them about with

clouds and thick darkness:--Could no such thing as favour and affection

enter this sacred Court--Did Wit disdain to take a bribe in it;--or was

ashamed to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment: 

Or, lastly, were we assured that Interest stood always unconcerned whilst

the cause was hearing--and that Passion never got into the judgment-seat,

and pronounced sentence in the stead of Reason, which is supposed always to

preside and determine upon the case:--Was this truly so, as the objection

must suppose;--no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would

be exactly what he himself esteemed it:--and the guilt or innocence of

every man's life could be known, in general, by no better measure, than the

degrees of his own approbation and censure.



'I own, in one case, whenever a man's conscience does accuse him (as it

seldom errs on that side) that he is guilty;--and unless in melancholy and

hypocondriac cases, we may safely pronounce upon it, that there is always

sufficient grounds for the accusation.



'But the converse of the proposition will not hold true;--namely, that

whenever there is guilt, the conscience must accuse; and if it does not,

that a man is therefore innocent.--This is not fact--So that the common

consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to

himself,--that he thanks God his mind does not misgive him; and that,

consequently, he has a good conscience, because he hath a quiet one,--is

fallacious;--and as current as the inference is, and as infallible as the

rule appears at first sight, yet when you look nearer to it, and try the

truth of this rule upon plain facts,--you see it liable to so much error

from a false application;--the principle upon which it goes so often

perverted;--the whole force of it lost, and sometimes so vilely cast away,

that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life, which

confirm the account.



'A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles;--

exceptionable in his conduct to the world; shall live shameless, in the

open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can justify,--a sin by

which, contrary to all the workings of humanity, he shall ruin for ever the

deluded partner of his guilt;--rob her of her best dowry; and not only

cover her own head with dishonour;--but involve a whole virtuous family in

shame and sorrow for her sake.  Surely, you will think conscience must lead

such a man a troublesome life; he can have no rest night and day from its

reproaches.



'Alas! Conscience had something else to do all this time, than break in

upon him; as Elijah reproached the god Baal,--this domestic god was either

talking, or pursuing, or was in a journey, or peradventure he slept and

could not be awoke.



'Perhaps He was gone out in company with Honour to fight a duel: to pay off

some debt at play;--or dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust; Perhaps

Conscience all this time was engaged at home, talking aloud against petty

larceny, and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune

and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing; so that

he lives as merrily;'--(If he was of our church, tho', quoth Dr. Slop, he

could not)--'sleeps as soundly in his bed;--and at last meets death

unconcernedly;--perhaps much more so, than a much better man.'



(All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr. Slop, turning to my father,--the

case could not happen in our church.--It happens in ours, however, replied

my father, but too often.--I own, quoth Dr. Slop, (struck a little with my

father's frank acknowledgment)--that a man in the Romish church may live as

badly;--but then he cannot easily die so.--'Tis little matter, replied my

father, with an air of indifference,--how a rascal dies.--I mean, answered

Dr. Slop, he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.--Pray how

many have you in all, said my uncle Toby,--for I always forget?--Seven,

answered Dr. Slop.--Humph!--said my uncle Toby; tho' not accented as a note

of acquiescence,--but as an interjection of that particular species of

surprize, when a man in looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing than

he expected.--Humph! replied my uncle Toby.  Dr. Slop, who had an ear,

understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against

the seven sacraments.--Humph! replied Dr. Slop, (stating my uncle Toby's

argument over again to him)--Why, Sir, are there not seven cardinal

virtues?--Seven mortal sins?--Seven golden candlesticks?--Seven heavens?--

'Tis more than I know, replied my uncle Toby.--Are there not seven wonders

of the world?--Seven days of the creation?--Seven planets?--Seven plagues?-

-That there are, quoth my father with a most affected gravity.  But

prithee, continued he, go on with the rest of thy characters, Trim.)



'Another is sordid, unmerciful,' (here Trim waved his right hand) 'a

strait-hearted, selfish wretch, incapable either of private friendship or

public spirit.  Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their

distress, and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh

or a prayer.'  (An' please your honours, cried Trim, I think this a viler

man than the other.)



'Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions?--No; thank

God there is no occasion, I pay every man his own;--I have no fornication

to answer to my conscience;--no faithless vows or promises to make up;--I

have debauched no man's wife or child; thank God, I am not as other men,

adulterers, unjust, or even as this libertine, who stands before me.



'A third is crafty and designing in his nature.  View his whole life;--'tis

nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges,

basely to defeat the true intent of all laws,--plain dealing and the safe

enjoyment of our several properties.--You will see such a one working out a

frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and

needy man;--shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth, or the

unsuspecting temper of his friend, who would have trusted him with his

life.



'When old age comes on, and repentance calls him to look back upon this

black account, and state it over again with his conscience--Conscience

looks into the Statutes at Large;--finds no express law broken by what he

has done;--perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels

incurred;--sees no scourge waving over his head, or prison opening his

gates upon him:--What is there to affright his conscience?--Conscience has

got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law; sits there

invulnerable, fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides;--

that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold.'



(Here Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby exchanged looks with each other.--

Aye, Aye, Trim! quoth my uncle Toby, shaking his head,--these are but sorry

fortifications, Trim.--O! very poor work, answered Trim, to what your

Honour and I make of it.--The character of this last man, said Dr. Slop,

interrupting Trim, is more detestable than all the rest; and seems to have

been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst you:--Amongst us, a man's

conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded,--three times in a

year, at least, he must go to confession.  Will that restore it to sight?

quoth my uncle Toby,--Go on, Trim, quoth my father, or Obadiah will have

got back before thou has got to the end of thy sermon.--'Tis a very short

one, replied Trim.--I wish it was longer, quoth my uncle Toby, for I like

it hugely.--Trim went on.)



'A fourth man shall want even this refuge;--shall break through all their

ceremony of slow chicane;--scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and

cautious trains to bring about his purpose:--See the bare-faced villain,

how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs, murders!--Horrid!--But indeed much

better was not to be expected, in the present case--the poor man was in the

dark!--his priest had got the keeping of his conscience;--and all he would

let him know of it, was, That he must believe in the Pope;--go to Mass;--

cross himself;--tell his beads;--be a good Catholic, and that this, in all

conscience, was enough to carry him to heaven.  What;--if he perjures?--

Why;--he had a mental reservation in it.--But if he is so wicked and

abandoned a wretch as you represent him;--if he robs,--if he stabs, will

not conscience, on every such act, receive a wound itself?--Aye,--but the

man has carried it to confession;--the wound digests there, and will do

well enough, and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution.  O

Popery! what hast thou to answer for!--when not content with the too many

natural and fatal ways, thro' which the heart of man is every day thus

treacherous to itself above all things;--thou hast wilfully set open the

wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller, too apt, God

knows, to go astray of himself, and confidently speak peace to himself,

when there is no peace.



'Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life, are too

notorious to require much evidence.  If any man doubts the reality of them,

or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself,--I must

refer him a moment to his own reflections, and will then venture to trust

my appeal with his own heart.



'Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation, numbers of

wicked actions stand there, tho' equally bad and vicious in their own

natures;--he will soon find, that such of them as strong inclination and

custom have prompted him to commit, are generally dressed out and painted

with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give

them;--and that the others, to which he feels no propensity, appear, at

once, naked and deformed, surrounded with all the true circumstances of

folly and dishonour.



'When David surprized Saul sleeping in the cave, and cut off the skirt of

his robe--we read his heart smote him for what he had done:--But in the

matter of Uriah, where a faithful and gallant servant, whom he ought to

have loved and honoured, fell to make way for his lust,--where conscience

had so much greater reason to take the alarm, his heart smote him not.  A

whole year had almost passed from first commission of that crime, to the

time Nathan was sent to reprove him; and we read not once of the least

sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified, during all that time,

for what he had done.



'Thus conscience, this once able monitor,--placed on high as a judge within

us, and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too,--by an

unhappy train of causes and impediments, takes often such imperfect

cognizance of what passes,--does its office so negligently,--sometimes so

corruptly,--that it is not to be trusted alone; and therefore we find there

is a necessity, an absolute necessity, of joining another principle with

it, to aid, if not govern, its determinations.



'So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite

importance to you not to be misled in,--namely, in what degree of real

merit you stand either as an honest man, an useful citizen, a faithful

subject to your king, or a good servant to your God,--call in religion and

morality.--Look, What is written in the law of God?--How readest thou?--

Consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth;-

-what say they?



'Let Conscience determine the matter upon these reports;--and then if thy

heart condemns thee not, which is the case the apostle supposes,--the rule

will be infallible;'--(Here Dr. Slop fell asleep)--'thou wilt have

confidence towards God;--that is, have just grounds to believe the judgment

thou hast past upon thyself, is the judgment of God;--and nothing else but

an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon

thee hereafter by that Being, to whom thou art finally to give an account

of thy actions.



'Blessed is the man, indeed, then, as the author of the book of

Ecclesiasticus expresses it, who is not pricked with the multitude of his

sins:  Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him; whether he be

rich, or whether he be poor, if he have a good heart (a heart thus guided

and informed) he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful countenance; his

mind shall tell him more than seven watch-men that sit above upon a tower

on high.'--(A tower has no strength, quoth my uncle Toby, unless 'tis

flank'd.)--'in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a

thousand casuists, and give the state he lives in, a better security for

his behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put together, which law-

makers are forced to multiply:--Forced, I say, as things stand; human laws

not being a matter of original choice, but of pure necessity, brought in to

fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law

unto themselves; well intending, by the many provisions made,--that in all

such corrupt and misguided cases, where principles and the checks of

conscience will not make us upright,--to supply their force, and, by the

terrors of gaols and halters, oblige us to it.'



(I see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been composed to be

preached at the Temple,--or at some Assize.--I like the reasoning,--and am

sorry that Dr. Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction:--

for it is now clear, that the Parson, as I thought at first, never insulted

St. Paul in the least;--nor has there been, brother, the least difference

between them.--A great matter, if they had differed, replied my uncle

Toby,--the best friends in the world may differ sometimes.--True,--brother

Toby quoth my father, shaking hands with him,--we'll fill our pipes,

brother, and then Trim shall go on.



Well,--what dost thou think of it? said my father, speaking to Corporal

Trim, as he reached his tobacco-box.



I think, answered the Corporal, that the seven watch-men upon the tower,

who, I suppose, are all centinels there,--are more, an' please your Honour,

than were necessary;--and, to go on at that rate, would harrass a regiment

all to pieces, which a commanding officer, who loves his men, will never

do, if he can help it, because two centinels, added the Corporal, are as

good as twenty.--I have been a commanding officer myself in the Corps de

Garde a hundred times, continued Trim, rising an inch higher in his figure,

as he spoke,--and all the time I had the honour to serve his Majesty King

William, in relieving the most considerable posts, I never left more than

two in my life.--Very right, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,--but you do not

consider, Trim, that the towers, in Solomon's days, were not such things as

our bastions, flanked and defended by other works;--this, Trim, was an

invention since Solomon's death; nor had they horn-works, or ravelins

before the curtin, in his time;--or such a fosse as we make with a cuvette

in the middle of it, and with covered ways and counterscarps pallisadoed

along it, to guard against a Coup de main:--So that the seven men upon the

tower were a party, I dare say, from the Corps de Garde, set there, not

only to look out, but to defend it.--They could be no more, an' please your

Honour, than a Corporal's Guard.--My father smiled inwardly, but not

outwardly--the subject being rather too serious, considering what had

happened, to make a jest of.--So putting his pipe into his mouth, which he

had just lighted,--he contented himself with ordering Trim to read on.  He

read on as follows:



'To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with

each other, to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and

wrong:--The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion;--the

second, those of morality, which are so inseparably connected together,

that you cannot divide these two tables, even in imagination, (tho' the

attempt is often made in practice) without breaking and mutually destroying

them both.



I said the attempt is often made; and so it is;--there being nothing more

common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion, and indeed

has so much honesty as to pretend to none, who would take it as the

bitterest affront, should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral

character,--or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to

the uttermost mite.



'When there is some appearance that it is so,--tho' one is unwilling even

to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty, yet were

we to look into the grounds of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we

should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive.



'Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject, it will be

found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest, his

pride, his ease, or some such little and changeable passion as will give us

but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress.



'I will illustrate this by an example.



'I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I usually call in,'--

(There is no need, cried Dr. Slop, (waking) to call in any physician in

this case)--'to be neither of them men of much religion:  I hear them make

a jest of it every day, and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn, as

to put the matter past doubt.  Well;--notwithstanding this, I put my

fortune into the hands of the one:--and what is dearer still to me, I trust

my life to the honest skill of the other.



'Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence.  Why, in

the first place, I believe there is no probability that either of them will

employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantage;--I consider

that honesty serves the purposes of this life:--I know their success in the

world depends upon the fairness of their characters.--In a word, I'm

persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more.



'But put it otherwise, namely, that interest lay, for once, on the other

side; that a case should happen, wherein the one, without stain to his

reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me naked in the world;--or

that the other could send me out of it, and enjoy an estate by my death,

without dishonour to himself or his art:--In this case, what hold have I of

either of them?--Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the

question;--Interest, the next most powerful motive in the world, is

strongly against me:--What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to

balance this temptation?--Alas! I have nothing,--nothing but what is

lighter than a bubble--I must lie at the mercy of Honour, or some such

capricious principle--Strait security for two of the most valuable

blessings!--my property and myself.



'As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon morality without religion;--

so, on the other hand, there is nothing better to be expected from religion

without morality; nevertheless, 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real

moral character stands very low, who yet entertains the highest notion of

himself in the light of a religious man.



'He shall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable,--but even wanting

in points of common honesty; yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the

infidelity of the age,--is zealous for some points of religion,--goes twice

a day to church,--attends the sacraments,--and amuses himself with a few

instrumental parts of religion,--shall cheat his conscience into a

judgment, that, for this, he is a religious man, and has discharged truly

his duty to God: And you will find that such a man, through force of this

delusion, generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man

who has less affectation of piety,--though, perhaps, ten times more real

honesty than himself.



'This likewise is a sore evil under the sun; and I believe, there is no one

mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious

mischiefs.--For a general proof of this,--examine the history of the Romish

church;'--(Well what can you make of that? cried Dr. Slop)--'see what

scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine, bloodshed,'--(They may thank their own

obstinacy, cried Dr. Slop)--have all been sanctified by a religion not

strictly governed by morality.



'In how many kingdoms of the world'--(Here Trim kept waving his right-hand

from the sermon to the extent of his arm, returning it backwards and

forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph.)



'In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this

misguided saint-errant, spared neither age or merit, or sex, or condition?-

-and, as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from

justice and humanity, he shewed none; mercilessly trampled upon both,--

heard neither the cries of the unfortunate, nor pitied their distresses.'



(I have been in many a battle, an' please your Honour, quoth Trim, sighing,

but never in so melancholy a one as this,--I would not have drawn a tricker

in it against these poor souls,--to have been made a general officer.--Why?

what do you understand of the affair? said Dr. Slop, looking towards Trim,

with something more of contempt than the Corporal's honest heart deserved.-

-What do you know, friend, about this battle you talk of?--I know, replied

Trim, that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for

it;--but to a woman or a child, continued Trim, before I would level my

musket at them, I would loose my life a thousand times.--Here's a crown for

thee, Trim, to drink with Obadiah to-night, quoth my uncle Toby, and I'll

give Obadiah another too.--God bless your Honour, replied Trim,--I had

rather these poor women and children had it.--thou art an honest fellow,

quoth my uncle Toby.--My father nodded his head, as much as to say--and so

he is.--



But prithee, Trim, said my father, make an end,--for I see thou hast but a

leaf or two left.



Corporal Trim read on.)



'If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient,--

consider at this instant, how the votaries of that religion are every day

thinking to do service and honour to God, by actions which are a dishonour

and scandal to themselves.



'To be convinced of this, go with me for a moment into the prisons of the

Inquisition.'--(God help my poor brother Tom.)--'Behold Religion, with

Mercy and Justice chained down under her feet,--there sitting ghastly upon

a black tribunal, propped up with racks and instruments of torment.  Hark!-

-hark! what a piteous groan!'--(Here Trims's face turned as pale as

ashes.)--'see the melancholy wretch who uttered it'--(Here the tears began

to trickle down)--'just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock

trial, and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has

been able to invent.'--(D..n them all, quoth Trim, his colour returning

into his face as red as blood.)--'Behold this helpless victim delivered up

to his tormentors,--his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement.'--(Oh!

'tis my brother, cried poor Trim in a most passionate exclamation, dropping

the sermon upon the ground, and clapping his hands together--I fear 'tis

poor Tom.  My father's and my uncle Toby's heart yearned with sympathy for

the poor fellow's distress; even Slop himself acknowledged pity for him.--

Why, Trim, said my father, this is not a history,--'tis a sermon thou art

reading; prithee begin the sentence again.)--'Behold this helpless victim

delivered up to his tormentors,--his body so wasted with sorrow and

confinement, you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers.



'Observe the last movement of that horrid engine!'--(I would rather face a

cannon, quoth Trim, stamping.)--'See what convulsions it has thrown him

into!--Consider the nature of the posture in which he how lies stretched,--

what exquisite tortures he endures by it!'--(I hope 'tis not in Portugal.)-

-''Tis all nature can bear!  Good God! see how it keeps his weary soul

hanging upon his trembling lips!'  (I would not read another line of it,

quoth Trim for all this world;--I fear, an' please your Honours, all this

is in Portugal, where my poor brother Tom is.  I tell thee, Trim, again,

quoth my father, 'tis not an historical account,--'tis a description.--'Tis

only a description, honest man, quoth Slop, there's not a word of truth in

it.--That's another story, replied my father.--However, as Trim reads it

with so much concern,--'tis cruelty to force him to go on with it.--Give me

hold of the sermon, Trim,--I'll finish it for thee, and thou may'st go.  I

must stay and hear it too, replied Trim, if your Honour will allow me;--

tho' I would not read it myself for a Colonel's pay.--Poor Trim! quoth my

uncle Toby.  My father went on.)



'--Consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched,--what

exquisite torture he endures by it!--'Tis all nature can bear!  Good God! 

See how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips,--willing

to take its leave,--but not suffered to depart!--Behold the unhappy wretch

led back to his cell!'--(Then, thank God, however, quoth Trim, they have

not killed him.)--'See him dragged out of it again to meet the flames, and

the insults in his last agonies, which this principle,--this principle,

that there can be religion without mercy, has prepared for him.'--(Then,

thank God,--he is dead, quoth Trim,--he is out of his pain,--and they have

done their worst at him.--O Sirs!--Hold your peace, Trim, said my father,

going on with the sermon, lest Trim should incense Dr. Slop,--we shall

never have done at this rate.)



'The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is, to trace down

the consequences such a notion has produced, and compare them with the

spirit of Christianity;--'tis the short and decisive rule which our Saviour

hath left us, for these and such like cases, and it is worth a thousand

arguments--By their fruits ye shall know them.



'I will add no farther to the length of this sermon, than by two or three

short and independent rules deducible from it.



'First, Whenever a man talks loudly against religion, always suspect that

it is not his reason, but his passions, which have got the better of his

Creed.  A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome

neighbours, and where they separate, depend upon it, 'tis for no other

cause but quietness sake.



'Secondly, When a man, thus represented, tells you in any particular

instance,--That such a thing goes against his conscience,--always believe

he means exactly the same thing, as when he tells you such a thing goes

against his stomach;--a present want of appetite being generally the true

cause of both.



'In a word,--trust that man in nothing, who has not a Conscience in every

thing.



'And, in your own case, remember this plain distinction, a mistake in which

has ruined thousands,--that your conscience is not a law;--No, God and

reason made the law, and have placed conscience within you to determine;--

not, like an Asiatic Cadi, according to the ebbs and flows of his own

passions,--but like a British judge in this land of liberty and good sense,

who makes no new law, but faithfully declares that law which he knows

already written.'



Finis.



Thou hast read the sermon extremely well, Trim, quoth my father.--If he had

spared his comments, replied Dr. Slop,--he would have read it much better. 

I should have read it ten times better, Sir, answered Trim, but that my

heart was so full.--that was the very reason, Trim, replied my father,

which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done; and if the

clergy of our church, continued my father, addressing himself to Dr. Slop,

would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow has

done,--as their compositions are fine;--(I deny it, quoth Dr. Slop)--I

maintain it,--that the eloquence of our pulpits, with such subjects to

enflame it, would be a model for the whole world:--But alas! continued my

father, and I own it, Sir, with sorrow, that, like French politicians in

this respect, what they gain in the cabinet they lose in the field.--'Twere

a pity, quoth my uncle, that has should be lost.  I like the sermon well,

replied my father,--'tis dramatick,--and there is something in that way of

writing, when skilfully managed, which catches the attention.--We preach

much in that way with us, said Dr. Slop.--I know that very well, said my

father,--but in a tone and manner which disgusted Dr. Slop, full as much as

his assent, simply, could have pleased him.--But in this, added Dr. Slop, a

little piqued,--our sermons have greatly the advantage, that we never

introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife,

or a martyr or a saint.--There are some very bad characters in this,

however, said my father, and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for

'em.--But pray, quoth my uncle Toby,--who's can this be?--How could it get

into my Stevinus?  A man must be as great a conjurer as Stevinus, said my

father, to resolve the second question:--The first, I think, is not so

difficult;--for unless my judgment greatly deceives me,--I know the author,

for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish.



The similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my father

constantly had heard preached in his parish-church, was the ground of his

conjecture,--proving it as strongly, as an argument a priori could prove

such a thing to a philosophic mind, That it was Yorick's and no one's

else:--It was proved to be so, a posteriori, the day after, when Yorick

sent a servant to my uncle Toby's house to enquire after it.



It seems that Yorick, who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge, had

borrowed Stevinus of my uncle Toby, and had carelesly popped his sermon, as

soon as he had made it, into the middle of Stevinus; and by an act of

forgetfulness, to which he was ever subject, he had sent Stevinus home, and

his sermon to keep him company.



Ill-fated sermon!  Thou wast lost, after this recovery of thee, a second

time, dropped thru' an unsuspected fissure in thy master's pocket, down

into a treacherous and a tattered lining,--trod deep into the dirt by the

left hind-foot of his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou

falledst;--buried ten days in the mire,--raised up out of it by a beggar,--

sold for a halfpenny to a parish-clerk,--transferred to his parson,--lost

for ever to thy own, the remainder of his days,--nor restored to his

restless Manes till this very moment, that I tell the world the story.



Can the reader believe, that this sermon of Yorick's was preached at an

assize, in the cathedral of York, before a thousand witnesses, ready to

give oath of it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually

printed by him when he had done,--and within so short a space as two years

and three months after Yorick's death?--Yorick indeed, was never better

served in his life;--but it was a little hard to maltreat him after, and

plunder him after he was laid in his grave.



However, as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with Yorick,--

and, in conscious justice, printed but a few copies to give away;--and that

I am told he could moreover have made as good a one himself, had he thought

fit,--I declare I would not have published this anecdote to the world;--nor

do I publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in the

church;--I leave that to others;--but I find myself impelled by two

reasons, which I cannot withstand.



The first is, That in doing justice, I may give rest to Yorick's ghost;--

which--as the country-people, and some others believe,--still walks.



The second reason is, That, by laying open this story to the world, I gain

an opportunity of informing it,--That in case the character of parson

Yorick, and this sample of his sermons, is liked,--there are now in the

possession of the Shandy family, as many as will make a handsome volume, at

the world's service,--and much good may they do it.





Chapter 1.XLIII.



Obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;--for he came in jingling,

with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of, flung across

his body, just as Corporal Trim went out of the room.



It is now proper, I think, quoth Dr. Slop, (clearing up his looks) as we

are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs. Shandy, to send up stairs

to know how she goes on.



I have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us upon

the least difficulty;--for you must know, Dr. Slop, continued my father,

with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by express

treaty, solemnly ratified between me and my wife, you are no more than an

auxiliary in this affair,--and not so much as that,--unless the lean old

mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you.--Women have their

particular fancies, and in points of this nature, continued my father,

where they bear the whole burden, and suffer so much acute pain for the

advantage of our families, and the good of the species,--they claim a right

of deciding, en Souveraines, in whose hands, and in what fashion, they

choose to undergo it.



They are in the right of it,--quoth my uncle Toby.  But Sir, replied Dr.

Slop, not taking notice of my uncle Toby's opinion, but turning to my

father,--they had better govern in other points;--and a father of a family,

who wishes its perpetuity, in my opinion, had better exchange this

prerogative with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of it.--I know

not, quoth my father, answering a letter too testily, to be quite

dispassionate in what he said,--I know not, quoth he, what we have left to

give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world, unless

that,--of who shall beget them.--One would almost give up any thing,

replied Dr. Slop.--I beg your pardon,--answered my uncle Toby.--Sir,

replied Dr. Slop, it would astonish you to know what improvements we have

made of late years in all branches of obstetrical knowledge, but

particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious

extraction of the foetus,--which has received such lights, that, for my

part (holding up his hand) I declare I wonder how the world has--I wish,

quoth my uncle Toby, you had seen what prodigious armies we had in

Flanders.





Chapter 1.XLIV.



I have dropped the curtain over this scene for a minute,--to remind you of

one thing,--and to inform you of another.



What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due course;--

for it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago, but that I

foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter, and be of more advantage here

than elsewhere.--Writers had need look before them, to keep up the spirit

and connection of what they have in hand.



When these two things are done,--the curtain shall be drawn up again, and

my uncle Toby, my father, and Dr. Slop, shall go on with their discourse,

without any more interruption.



First, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is this;--that from

the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of

Christian-names, and that other previous point thereto,--you was led, I

think, into an opinion,--(and I am sure I said as much) that my father was

a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions.  In

truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very first act of

his begetting,--down to the lean and slippered pantaloon in his second

childishness, but he had some favourite notion to himself, springing out of

it, as sceptical, and as far out of the high-way of thinking, as these two

which have been explained.



--Mr. Shandy, my father, Sir, would see nothing in the light in which

others placed it;--he placed things in his own light;--he would weigh

nothing in common scales;--no, he was too refined a researcher to lie open

to so gross an imposition.--To come at the exact weight of things in the

scientific steel-yard, the fulcrum, he would say, should be almost

invisible, to avoid all friction from popular tenets;--without this the

minutiae of philosophy, which would always turn the balance, will have no

weight at all.  Knowledge, like matter, he would affirm, was divisible in

infinitum;--that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it, as the

gravitation of the whole world.--In a word, he would say, error was error,-

-no matter where it fell,--whether in a fraction,--or a pound,--'twas alike

fatal to truth, and she was kept down at the bottom of her well, as

inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly's wing,--as in the disk

of the sun, the moon, and all the stars of heaven put together.



He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly,

and of applying it skilfully to civil matters, as well as to speculative

truths, that so many things in this world were out of joint;--that the

political arch was giving way;--and that the very foundations of our

excellent constitution in church and state, were so sapped as estimators

had reported.



You cry out, he would say, we are a ruined, undone people.  Why? he would

ask, making use of the sorites or syllogism of Zeno and Chrysippus, without

knowing it belonged to them.--Why? why are we a ruined people?--Because we

are corrupted.--Whence is it, dear Sir, that we are corrupted?--Because we

are needy;--our poverty, and not our wills, consent.--And wherefore, he

would add, are we needy?--From the neglect, he would answer, of our pence

and our halfpence:--Our bank notes, Sir, our guineas,--nay our shillings

take care of themselves.



'Tis the same, he would say, throughout the whole circle of the sciences;--

the great, the established points of them, are not to be broke in upon.--

The laws of nature will defend themselves;--but error--(he would add,

looking earnestly at my mother)--error, Sir, creeps in thro' the minute

holes and small crevices which human nature leaves unguarded.



This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you of:--The

point you are to be informed of, and which I have reserved for this place,

is as follows.



Amongst the many and excellent reasons, with which my father had urged my

mother to accept of Dr. Slop's assistance preferably to that of the old

woman,--there was one of a very singular nature; which, when he had done

arguing the matter with her as a Christian, and came to argue it over again

with her as a philosopher, he had put his whole strength to, depending

indeed upon it as his sheet-anchor.--It failed him, tho' from no defect in

the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was not able for his

soul to make her comprehend the drift of it.--Cursed luck!--said he to

himself, one afternoon, as he walked out of the room, after he had been

stating it for an hour and a half to her, to no manner of purpose;--cursed

luck! said he, biting his lip as he shut the door,--for a man to be master

of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature,--and have a wife at the

same time with such a head-piece, that he cannot hang up a single inference

within side of it, to save his soul from destruction.



This argument, though it was entirely lost upon my mother,--had more weight

with him, than all his other arguments joined together:--I will therefore

endeavour to do it justice,--and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am

master of.



My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms:



First, That an ounce of a man's own wit, was worth a ton of other people's;

and,



Secondly, (Which by the bye, was the ground-work of the first axiom,--tho'

it comes last) That every man's wit must come from every man's own soul,--

and no other body's.



Now, as it was plain to my father, that all souls were by nature equal,--

and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse

understanding--was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking

substance above or below another,--but arose merely from the lucky or

unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the soul principally

took up her residence,--he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find

out the identical place.



Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter, he was

satisfied it could not be where Des Cartes had fixed it, upon the top of

the pineal gland of the brain; which, as he philosophized, formed a cushion

for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho' to speak the truth, as so many

nerves did terminate all in that one place,--'twas no bad conjecture;--and

my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the

centre of the mistake, had it not been for my uncle Toby, who rescued him

out of it, by a story he told him of a Walloon officer at the battle of

Landen, who had one part of his brain shot away by a musket-ball,--and

another part of it taken out after by a French surgeon; and after all,

recovered, and did his duty very well without it.



If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but the

separation of the soul from the body;--and if it is true that people can

walk about and do their business without brains,--then certes the soul does

not inhabit there.  Q.E.D.



As for that certain, very thin, subtle and very fragrant juice which

Coglionissimo Borri, the great Milaneze physician affirms, in a letter to

Bartholine, to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts of

the cerebellum, and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of

the reasonable soul, (for, you must know, in these latter and more

enlightened ages, there are two souls in every man living,--the one,

according to the great Metheglingius, being called the Animus, the other,

the Anima;)--as for the opinion, I say of Borri,--my father could never

subscribe to it by any means; the very idea of so noble, so refined, so

immaterial, and so exalted a being as the Anima, or even the Animus, taking

up her residence, and sitting dabbling, like a tad-pole all day long, both

summer and winter, in a puddle,--or in a liquid of any kind, how thick or

thin soever, he would say, shocked his imagination; he would scarce give

the doctrine a hearing.



What, therefore, seemed the least liable to objections of any, was that the

chief sensorium, or head-quarters of the soul, and to which place all

intelligences were referred, and from whence all her mandates were issued,-

-was in, or near, the cerebellum,--or rather somewhere about the medulla

oblongata, wherein it was generally agreed by Dutch anatomists, that all

the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered, like

streets and winding alleys, into a square.



So far there was nothing singular in my father's opinion,--he had the best

of philosophers, of all ages and climates, to go along with him.--But here

he took a road of his own, setting up another Shandean hypothesis upon

these corner-stones they had laid for him;--and which said hypothesis

equally stood its ground; whether the subtilty and fineness of the soul

depended upon the temperature and clearness of the said liquor, or of the

finer net-work and texture in the cerebellum itself; which opinion he

favoured.



He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act of

propagation of each individual, which required all the thought in the

world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture, in

which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is usually meant by the name

of good natural parts, do consist;--that next to this and his Christian-

name, which were the two original and most efficacious causes of all;--that

the third cause, or rather what logicians call the Causa sina qua non, and

without which all that was done was of no manner of significance,--was the

preservation of this delicate and fine-spun web, from the havock which was

generally made in it by the violent compression and crush which the head

was made to undergo, by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the

world by that foremost.



--This requires explanation.



My father, who dipped into all kinds of books, upon looking into

Lithopaedus Senonesis de Portu difficili, (The author is here twice

mistaken; for Lithopaedus should be wrote thus, Lithopaedii Senonensis

Icon.  The second mistake is, that this Lithopaedus is not an author, but a

drawing of a petrified child.  The account of this, published by Athosius

1580, may be seen at the end of Cordaeus's works in Spachius.  Mr. Tristram

Shandy has been led into this error, either from seeing Lithopaedus's name

of late in a catalogue of learned writers in Dr. . ., or by mistaking

Lithopaedus for Trinecavellius,--from the too great similitude of the

names.) published by Adrianus Smelvgot, had found out, that the lax and

pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the bones of the cranium

having no sutures at that time, was such,--that by force of the woman's

efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was equal, upon an average, to the

weight of 470 pounds avoirdupois acting perpendicularly upon it;--it so

happened, that in 49 instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and

moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a

pastry-cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of.--Good God! cried

my father, what havock and destruction must this make in the infinitely

fine and tender texture of the cerebellum!--Or if there is such a juice as

Borri pretends--is it not enough to make the clearest liquid in the world

both seculent and mothery?



But how great was his apprehension, when he farther understood, that this

force acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only injured the brain

itself, or cerebrum,--but that it necessarily squeezed and propelled the

cerebrum towards the cerebellum, which was the immediate seat of the

understanding!--Angels and ministers of grace defend us! cried my father,--

can any soul withstand this shock?--No wonder the intellectual web is so

rent and tattered as we see it; and that so many of our best heads are no

better than a puzzled skein of silk,--all perplexity,--all confusion

within-side.



But when my father read on, and was let into the secret, that when a child

was turned topsy-turvy, which was easy for an operator to do, and was

extracted by the feet;--that instead of the cerebrum being propelled

towards the cerebellum, the cerebellum, on the contrary, was propelled

simply towards the cerebrum, where it could do no manner of hurt:--By

heavens! cried he, the world is in conspiracy to drive out what little wit

God has given us,--and the professors of the obstetric art are listed into

the same conspiracy.--What is it to me which end of my son comes foremost

into the world, provided all goes right after, and his cerebellum escapes

uncrushed?



It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it, that

it assimilates every thing to itself, as proper nourishment; and, from the

first moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the stronger by every

thing you see, hear, read, or understand.  This is of great use.



When my father was gone with this about a month, there was scarce a

phaenomenon of stupidity or of genius, which he could not readily solve by

it;--it accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in the

family.--Poor devil, he would say,--he made way for the capacity of his

younger brothers.--It unriddled the observations of drivellers and

monstrous heads,--shewing a priori, it could not be otherwise,--unless . .

. I don't know what.  It wonderfully explained and accounted for the acumen

of the Asiatic genius, and that sprightlier turn, and a more penetrating

intuition of minds, in warmer climates; not from the loose and common-place

solution of a clearer sky, and a more perpetual sunshine, &c.--which for

aught he knew, might as well rarefy and dilute the faculties of the soul

into nothing, by one extreme,--as they are condensed in colder climates by

the other;--but he traced the affair up to its spring-head;--shewed that,

in warmer climates, nature had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of

the creation;--their pleasures more;--the necessity of their pains less,

insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight,

that the whole organization of the cerebellum was preserved;--nay, he did

not believe, in natural births, that so much as a single thread of the net-

work was broke or displaced,--so that the soul might just act as she liked.



When my father had got so far,--what a blaze of light did the accounts of

the Caesarian section, and of the towering geniuses who had come safe into

the world by it, cast upon this hypothesis?  Here you see, he would say,

there was no injury done to the sensorium;--no pressure of the head against

the pelvis;--no propulsion of the cerebrum towards the cerebellum, either

by the os pubis on this side, or os coxygis on that;--and pray, what were

the happy consequences?  Why, Sir, your Julius Caesar, who gave the

operation a name;--and your Hermes Trismegistus, who was born so before

ever the operation had a name;--your Scipio Africanus; your Manlius

Torquatus; our Edward the Sixth,--who, had he lived, would have done the

same honour to the hypothesis:--These, and many more who figured high in

the annals of fame,--all came side-way, Sir, into the world.



The incision of the abdomen and uterus ran for six weeks together in my

father's head;--he had read, and was satisfied, that wounds in the

epigastrium, and those in the matrix, were not mortal;--so that the belly

of the mother might be opened extremely well to give a passage to the

child.--He mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother,--merely as a

matter of fact; but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of

it, as much as the operation flattered his hopes,--he thought it as well to

say no more of it,--contenting himself with admiring,--what he thought was

to no purpose to propose.



This was my father Mr. Shandy's hypothesis; concerning which I have only to

add, that my brother Bobby did as great honour to it (whatever he did to

the family) as any one of the great heroes we spoke of:  For happening not

only to be christened, as I told you, but to be born too, when my father

was at Epsom,--being moreover my mother's first child,--coming into the

world with his head foremost,--and turning out afterwards a lad of

wonderful slow parts,--my father spelt all these together into his opinion: 

and as he had failed at one end,--he was determined to try the other.



This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are not easily

to be put out of their way,--and was therefore one of my father's great

reasons in favour of a man of science, whom he could better deal with.



Of all men in the world, Dr. Slop was the fittest for my father's purpose;-

-for though this new-invented forceps was the armour he had proved, and

what he maintained to be the safest instrument of deliverance, yet, it

seems, he had scattered a word or two in his book, in favour of the very

thing which ran in my father's fancy;--tho' not with a view to the soul's

good in extracting by the feet, as was my father's system,--but for reasons

merely obstetrical.



This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr. Slop, in the

ensuing discourse, which went a little hard against my uncle Toby.--In what

manner a plain man, with nothing but common sense, could bear up against

two such allies in science,--is hard to conceive.--You may conjecture upon

it, if you please,--and whilst your imagination is in motion, you may

encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes and effects in nature it

could come to pass, that my uncle Toby got his modesty by the wound he

received upon his groin.--You may raise a system to account for the loss of

my nose by marriage-articles,--and shew the world how it could happen, that

I should have the misfortune to be called Tristram, in opposition to my

father's hypothesis, and the wish of the whole family, Godfathers and

Godmothers not excepted.--These, with fifty other points left yet

unravelled, you may endeavour to solve if you have time;--but I tell you

beforehand it will be in vain, for not the sage Alquise, the magician in

Don Belianis of Greece, nor the no less famous Urganda, the sorceress his

wife, (were they alive) could pretend to come within a league of the truth.



The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these matters

till the next year,--when a series of things will be laid open which he

little expects.





Chapter 1.XLV.



--'I wish, Dr. Slop,' quoth my uncle Toby, (repeating his wish for Dr. Slop

a second time, and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in his manner

of wishing, than he had wished at first (Vide.))--'I wish, Dr. Slop,' quoth

my uncle Toby, 'you had seen what prodigious armies we had in Flanders.'



My uncle Toby's wish did Dr. Slop a disservice which his heart never

intended any man,--Sir, it confounded him--and thereby putting his ideas

first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again for

the soul of him.



In all disputes,--male or female,--whether for honour, for profit, or for

love,--it makes no difference in the case;--nothing is more dangerous,

Madam, than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner upon a man: 

the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish, is for the

party wish'd at, instantly to get upon his legs--and wish the wisher

something in return, of pretty near the same value,--so balancing the

account upon the spot, you stand as you were--nay sometimes gain the

advantage of the attack by it.



This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of wishes.--



Dr. Slop did not understand the nature of this defence;--he was puzzled

with it, and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a

half;--five had been fatal to it:--my father saw the danger--the dispute

was one of the most interesting disputes in the world, 'Whether the child

of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or with one:'--

he waited to the last moment, to allow Dr. Slop, in whose behalf the wish

was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, I say, that he was

confounded, and continued looking with that perplexed vacuity of eye which

puzzled souls generally stare with--first in my uncle Toby's face--then in

his--then up--then down--then east--east and by east, and so on,--coasting

it along by the plinth of the wainscot till he had got to the opposite

point of the compass,--and that he had actually begun to count the brass

nails upon the arm of his chair,--my father thought there was no time to be

lost with my uncle Toby, so took up the discourse as follows.





Chapter 1.XLVI.



'--What prodigious armies you had in Flanders!'--



Brother Toby, replied my father, taking his wig from off his head with his

right hand, and with his left pulling out a striped India handkerchief from

his right coat pocket, in order to rub his head, as he argued the point

with my uncle Toby.--



--Now, in this I think my father was much to blame; and I will give you my

reasons for it.



Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than, 'Whether my

father should have taken off his wig with his right hand or with his

left,'--have divided the greatest kingdoms, and made the crowns of the

monarchs who governed them, to totter upon their heads.--But need I tell

you, Sir, that the circumstances with which every thing in this world is

begirt, give every thing in this world its size and shape!--and by

tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to be, what

it is--great--little--good--bad--indifferent or not indifferent, just as

the case happens?



As my father's India handkerchief was in his right coat pocket, he should

by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged:  on the

contrary, instead of taking off his wig with it, as he did, he ought to

have committed that entirely to the left; and then, when the natural

exigency my father was under of rubbing his head, called out for his

handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the world to have done, but to

have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken it out;--which

he might have done without any violence, or the least ungraceful twist in

any one tendon or muscle of his whole body.



In this case, (unless, indeed, my father had been resolved to make a fool

of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left hand--or by making some

nonsensical angle or other at his elbow-joint, or armpit)--his whole

attitude had been easy--natural--unforced:  Reynolds himself, as great and

gracefully as he paints, might have painted him as he sat.



Now as my father managed this matter,--consider what a devil of a figure my

father made of himself.



In the latter end of Queen Anne's reign, and in the beginning of the reign

of King George the first--'Coat pockets were cut very low down in the

skirt.'--I need say no more--the father of mischief, had he been hammering

at it a month, could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my

father's situation.





Chapter 1.XLVII.



It was not an easy matter in any king's reign (unless you were as lean a

subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your

whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat pocket.--In the

year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this happened, it was

extremely difficult; so that when my uncle Toby discovered the transverse

zig-zaggery of my father's approaches towards it, it instantly brought into

his mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of St. Nicolas;--the

idea of which drew off his attention so intirely from the subject in

debate, that he had got his right hand to the bell to ring up Trim to go

and fetch his map of Namur, and his compasses and sector along with it, to

measure the returning angles of the traverses of that attack,--but

particularly of that one, where he received his wound upon his groin.



My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in his body

seemed to rush up into his face--my uncle Toby dismounted immediately.



--I did not apprehend your uncle Toby was o'horseback.--





Chapter 1.XLVIII.



A man's body and his mind, with the utmost reverence to both I speak it,

are exactly like a jerkin, and a jerkin's lining;--rumple the one,--you

rumple the other.  There is one certain exception however in this case, and

that is, when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to have had your jerkin

made of gum-taffeta, and the body-lining to it of a sarcenet, or thin

persian.



Zeno, Cleanthes, Diogenes Babylonius, Dionysius, Heracleotes, Antipater,

Panaetius, and Possidonius amongst the Greeks;--Cato and Varro and Seneca

amongst the Romans;--Pantenus and Clemens Alexandrinus and Montaigne

amongst the Christians; and a score and a half of good, honest, unthinking

Shandean people as ever lived, whose names I can't recollect,--all

pretended that their jerkins were made after this fashion,--you might have

rumpled and crumpled, and doubled and creased, and fretted and fridged the

outside of them all to pieces;--in short, you might have played the very

devil with them, and at the same time, not one of the insides of them would

have been one button the worse, for all you had done to them.



I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after this sort:--

for never poor jerkin has been tickled off at such a rate as it has been

these last nine months together,--and yet I declare, the lining to it,--as

far as I am a judge of the matter,--is not a three-penny piece the worse;--

pell-mell, helter-skelter, ding-dong, cut and thrust, back stroke and fore

stroke, side way and long-way, have they been trimming it for me:--had

there been the least gumminess in my lining,--by heaven! it had all of it

long ago been frayed and fretted to a thread.



--You Messrs. the Monthly Reviewers!--how could you cut and slash my jerkin

as you did?--how did you know but you would cut my lining too?



Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who will injure

none of us, do I recommend you and your affairs,--so God bless you;--only

next month, if any one of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at

me, as some of you did last May (in which I remember the weather was very

hot)--don't be exasperated, if I pass it by again with good temper,--being

determined as long as I live or write) which in my case means the same

thing) never to give the honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish than

my uncle Toby gave the fly which buzz'd about his nose all dinner-time,--

'Go,--go, poor devil,' quoth he,--'get thee gone,--why should I hurt thee! 

This world is surely wide enough to hold both thee and me.'





Chapter 1.XLIX.



Any man, Madam, reasoning upwards, and observing the prodigious suffusion

of blood in my father's countenance,--by means of which (as all the blood

in his body seemed to rush into his face, as I told you) he must have

reddened, pictorically and scientifically speaking, six whole tints and a

half, if not a full octave above his natural colour:--any man, Madam, but

my uncle Toby, who had observed this, together with the violent knitting of

my father's brows, and the extravagant contortion of his body during the

whole affair,--would have concluded my father in a rage; and taking that

for granted,--had he been a lover of such kind of concord as arises from

two such instruments being put in exact tune,--he would instantly have

skrew'd up his, to the same pitch;--and then the devil and all had broke

loose--the whole piece, Madam, must have been played off like the sixth of

Avison Scarlatti--con furia,--like mad.--Grant me patience!--What has con

furia,--con strepito,--or any other hurly burly whatever to do with

harmony?



Any man, I say, Madam, but my uncle Toby, the benignity of whose heart

interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest sense the motion would

admit of, would have concluded my father angry, and blamed him too.  My

uncle Toby blamed nothing but the taylor who cut the pocket-hole;--so

sitting still till my father had got his handkerchief out of it, and

looking all the time up in his face with inexpressible good-will--my

father, at length, went on as follows.





Chapter 1.L.



'What prodigious armies you had in Flanders!'



--Brother Toby, quoth my father, I do believe thee to be as honest a man,

and with as good and as upright a heart as ever God created;--nor is it thy

fault, if all the children which have been, may, can, shall, will, or ought

to be begotten, come with their heads foremost into the world:--but believe

me, dear Toby, the accidents which unavoidably way-lay them, not only in

the article of our begetting 'em--though these, in my opinion, are well

worth considering,--but the dangers and difficulties our children are beset

with, after they are got forth into the world, are enow--little need is

there to expose them to unnecessary ones in their passage to it.--Are these

dangers, quoth my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon my father's knee, and

looking up seriously in his face for an answer,--are these dangers greater

now o'days, brother, than in times past?  Brother Toby, answered my father,

if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and healthy, and the

mother did well after it,--our forefathers never looked farther.--My uncle

Toby instantly withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his

body gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the

cornice of the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his

cheeks, and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty--he

whistled Lillabullero.





Chapter 1.LI.



Whilst my uncle Toby was whistling Lillabullero to my father,--Dr. Slop was

stamping, and cursing and damning at Obadiah at a most dreadful rate,--it

would have done your heart good, and cured you, Sir, for ever of the vile

sin of swearing, to have heard him, I am determined therefore to relate the

whole affair to you.



When Dr. Slop's maid delivered the green baize bag with her master's

instruments in it, to Obadiah, she very sensibly exhorted him to put his

head and one arm through the strings, and ride with it slung across his

body:  so undoing the bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without

any more ado, she helped him on with it.  However, as this, in some

measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in

galloping back, at the speed Obadiah threatened, they consulted to take it

off again:  and in the great care and caution of their hearts, they had

taken the two strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth of the bag

first) with half a dozen hard knots, each of which Obadiah, to make all

safe, had twitched and drawn together with all the strength of his body.



This answered all that Obadiah and the maid intended; but was no remedy

against some evils which neither he or she foresaw.  The instruments, it

seems, as tight as the bag was tied above, had so much room to play in it,

towards the bottom (the shape of the bag being conical) that Obadiah could

not make a trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with the tire

tete, forceps, and squirt, as would have been enough, had Hymen been taking

a jaunt that way, to have frightened him out of the country; but when

Obadiah accelerated his motion, and from a plain trot assayed to prick his

coach-horse into a full gallop--by Heaven! Sir, the jingle was incredible.



As Obadiah had a wife and three children--the turpitude of fornication, and

the many other political ill consequences of this jingling, never once

entered his brain,--he had however his objection, which came home to

himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with the greatest

patriots.--'The poor fellow, Sir, was not able to hear himself whistle.'





Chapter 1.LII.



As Obadiah loved wind-music preferably to all the instrumental music he

carried with him,--he very considerately set his imagination to work, to

contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition

of enjoying it.



In all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted, nothing is

so apt to enter a man's head as his hat-band:--the philosophy of this is so

near the surface--I scorn to enter into it.



As Obadiah's was a mixed case--mark, Sirs,--I say, a mixed case; for it was

obstetrical,--scrip-tical, squirtical, papistical--and as far as the coach-

horse was concerned in it,--caballistical--and only partly musical;--

Obadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the first expedient which

offered; so taking hold of the bag and instruments, and griping them hard

together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb of the other putting

the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and then slipping his hand down

to the middle of it,--he tied and cross-tied them all fast together from

one end to the other (as you would cord a trunk) with such a multiplicity

of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with a hard knot at every

intersection or point where the strings met,--that Dr. Slop must have had

three fifths of Job's patience at least to have unloosed them.--I think in

my conscience, that had Nature been in one of her nimble moods, and in

humour for such a contest--and she and Dr. Slop both fairly started

together--there is no man living which had seen the bag with all that

Obadiah had done to it,--and known likewise the great speed the Goddess can

make when she thinks proper, who would have had the least doubt remaining

in his mind--which of the two would have carried off the prize.  My mother,

Madam, had been delivered sooner than the green bag infallibly--at least by

twenty knots.--Sport of small accidents, Tristram Shandy! that thou art,

and ever will be! had that trial been for thee, and it was fifty to one but

it had,--thy affairs had not been so depress'd--(at least by the depression

of thy nose) as they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the

occasions of making them, which have so often presented themselves in the

course of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so tamely, so

irrecoverably abandoned--as thou hast been forced to leave them;--but 'tis

over,--all but the account of 'em, which cannot be given to the curious

till I am got out into the world.
