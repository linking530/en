<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Such was the house, the household, and the business Mr Verloc left
behind him on his way westward at the hour of half past ten in the morning.
It was unusually early for him; his whole person exhaled the charm of almost
dewy freshness; he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots were
shiny; his cheeks, freshly shaven, had a sort of gloss; and even his heavy-lidded
eyes, refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber, sent out glances of comparative
alertness. Through the park railings these glances beheld men and women
riding in the Row, couples cantering past harmoniously, others advancing
sedately at a walk, loitering groups of three or four, solitary horsemen
looking unsociable, and solitary women followed at a long distance by a
groom with a cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tight-fitting
coat. Carriages went bowling by, mostly two-horse broughams, with here
and there a victoria with the skin of some wild beast inside and a woman's
face and hat emerging above the folded hood. And a peculiarly London sun
- against which nothing could be said except that it looked bloodshot -
glorified all this by its stare. It hung at a moderate elevation above
Hyde Park Corner with an air of punctual and benign vigilance. The very
pavement under Mr Verloc's feet had an old-gold tinge in that diffused
light, in which neither wall, nor tree, nor beast, nor man cast a shadow.
Mr Verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere
of powdered old gold. There were red, coppery gleams on the roofs of houses,
on the corners of walls, on the panels of carriages, on the very coats
of the horses, and on the broad back of Mr Verloc's overcoat, where they
produced a dull effect of rustiness. But Mr Verloc was not in the least
conscious of having got rusty. He surveyed through the park railings the
evidences of the town's opulence and luxury with an approving eye. All
these people had to be protected. Protection is the first necessity of
opulence and luxury. They had to be protected; and their horses, carriages,
houses, servants had to be protected; and the source of their wealth had
to be protected in the heart of the city and the heart of the country;
the whole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be
protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour. It had
to - and Mr Verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he
not been constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion. His idleness
was not hygienic, but it suited him very well. He was in a manner devoted
to it with a sort of inert fanaticism, or perhaps rather with a fanatical
inertness. Born of industrious parents for a life of toil, he had embraced
indolence from an impulse as profound, as inexplicable and as imperious
as the impulse which directs a man's preference for one particular woman
in a given thousand. He was too lazy even for a mere demagogue, for a workman
orator, for a leader of labour. It was too much trouble. He required a
more perfect form of ease; or it might have been that he was the victim
of a philosophical unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort.
Such a form of indolence requires, implies, a certain amount of intelligence.
Mr Verloc was not devoid of intelligence - and at the notion of a menaced
social order he would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been
an effort to make in that sign of scepticism. His big, prominent eyes were
not well adapted to winking. They were rather of the sort that closes solemnly
in slumber with majestic effect.

<P>Undemonstrative and burly in a fat-pig style, Mr Verloc, without either
rubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking sceptically at his thoughts,
proceeded on his way. He trod the pavement heavily with his shiny boots,
and his general get-up was that of a well-to-do mechanic in business for
himself. He might have been anything from a picture-frame maker to a locksmith;
an employer of labour in a small way. But there was also about him an indescribable
air which no mechanic could have acquired in the practice of his handicraft
however dishonestly exercised: the air common to men who live on the vices,
the follies, or the baser fears of mankind; the air of moral nihilism common
to keepers of gambling hells and disorderly houses; to private detectives
and inquiry agents; to drink sellers and, I should say, to the sellers
of invigorating electric belts and to the inventors of patent medicines.
But of that last I am not sure, not having carried my investigations so
far into the depths. For all I know, the expression of these last may be
perfectly diabolic. I shouldn't be surprised. What I want to affirm is
that Mr Verloc's expression was by no means diabolic.

<P>Before reaching Knightsbridge, Mr Verloc took a turn to the left out
of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses
and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms. Under his
hat, worn with a slight backward tilt, his hair had been carefully brushed
into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an embassy. And Mr
Verloc, steady like a rock - a soft kind of rock - marched now along a
street which could with every propriety be described as private. In its
breadth, emptiness, and extent it had the majesty of inorganic nature,
of matter that never dies. The only reminder of mortality was a doctor's
brougham arrested in august solitude close to the kerbstone. The polished
knockers of the doors gleamed as far as the eye could reach, the clean
windows shone with a dark opaque lustre. And all was still. But a milk
cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective; a butcher boy, driving
with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at Olympic Games, dashed round
the corner sitting high above a pair of red wheels. A guilty-looking cat
issuing from under the stones ran for a while in front of Mr Verloc, then
dived into another basement; and a thick police constable, looking a stranger
to every emotion, as if he, too, were part of inorganic nature, surging
apparently out of a lamp-post, took not the slightest notice of Mr Verloc.
With a turn to the left Mr Verloc pursued his way along a narrow street
by the side of a yellow wall which, for some inscrutable reason, had No.
1 Chesham Square written on it in black letters. Chesham Square was at
least sixty yards away, and Mr Verloc, cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived
by London's topographical mysteries, held on steadily, without a sign of
surprise or indignation. At last, with business-like persistency, he reached
the Square, and made diagonally for the number 20. This belonged to an
imposing carriage gate in a high, clean wall between two houses, of which
one rationally enough bore the number 9 and the other was numbered 37;
but the fact that this last belonged to Porthill Street, a street well
known in the neighbourhood, was proclaimed by an inscription placed above
the ground-floor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is charged
with the duty of keeping track of London's strayed houses. Why powers are
not asked of Parliament (a short Act would do) for compelling those edifices
to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of municipal administration.
Mr Verloc did not trouble his head about it, his mission in life being
the protection of the social mechanism, not its perfectionment or even
its criticism.

<P>It was so early that the porter of the Embassy issued hurriedly out
of his lodge still struggling with the left sleeve of his livery coat.
His waistcoat was red, and he wore knee-breeches, but his aspect was flustered.
Mr Verloc, aware of the rush on his flank, drove it off by simply holding
out an envelope stamped with the arms of the Embassy, and passed on. He
produced the same talisman also to the footman who opened the door, and
stood back to let him enter the hall.

<P>A clear fire burned in a tall fireplace, and an elderly man standing
with his back to it, in evening dress and with a chain round his neck,
glanced up from the newspaper he was holding spread out in both hands before
his calm and severe face. He didn't move; but another lackey, in brown
trousers and clawhammer coat edged with thin yellow cord, approaching Mr
Verloc listened to the murmur of his name, and turning round on his heel
in silence, began to walk, without looking back once. Mr Verloc, thus led
along a ground-floor passage to the left of the great carpeted staircase,
was suddenly motioned to enter a quite small room furnished with a heavy
writing-table and a few chairs. The servant shut the door, and Mr Verloc
remained alone. He did not take a seat. With his hat and stick held in
one hand he glanced about, passing his other podgy hand over his uncovered
sleek head.

<P>Another door opened noiselessly, and Mr Verloc immobilizing his glance
in that direction saw at first only black clothes. The bald top of a head,
and a drooping dark grey whisker on each side of a pair of wrinkled hands.
The person who had entered was holding a batch of papers before his eyes
and walked up to the table with a rather mincing step, turning the papers
over the while. Privy Councillor Wurmt, Chancellor d'Ambassade, was rather
shortsighted. This meritorious official, laying the papers on the table,
disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded
by a lot of fine, long, dark grey hairs, barred heavily by thick and bushy
eyebrows. He put on a black-framed pince-nez upon a blunt and shapeless
nose, and seemed struck by Mr Verloc's appearance. Under the enormous eyebrows
his weak eyes blinked pathetically through the glasses.

<P>He made no sign of greeting; neither did Mr Verloc who certainly knew
his place; but a subtle change about the general outlines of his shoulders
and back suggested a slight bending of Mr Verloc's spine under the vast
surface of his overcoat. The effect was of unobtrusive deference.

<P>`I have here some of your reports,' said the bureaucrat in an unexpectedly
soft and weary voice, and pressing the tip of his forefinger on the papers
with force. He paused; and Mr Verloc, who had recognized his own handwriting
very well, waited in an almost breathless silence. `We are not very satisfied
with the attitude of the police here,' the other continued, with every
appearance of mental fatigue.'

<P>The shoulders of Mr Verloc, without actually moving, suggested a shrug.
And for the first time since he left his home that morning his lips opened.

<P>`Every country has its police,' he said, philosophically. But as the
official of the Embassy went on blinking at him steadily he felt constrained
to add: `Allow me to observe that I have no means of action upon the police
here.'

<P>`What is desired,' said the man of papers, `is the occurrence of something
definite which should stimulate their vigilance. That is within your province
- is it not so?'

<P>Mr Verloc made no answer except by a sigh, which escaped him involuntarily,
for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful expression. The official
blinked doubtfully, as if affected by the dim light of the room. He repeated
vaguely:

<P>`The vigilance of the police - and the severity of the magistrates.
The general leniency of the judicial procedure here, and the utter absence
of all repressive measures, are a scandal to Europe. What is wished for
just now is the accentuation of the unrest - of the fermentation which
undoubtedly exists--'

<P>`Undoubtedly, undoubtedly,' broke in Mr Verloc in a deep, deferential
bass of an oratorical quality, so utterly different from the tone in which
he had spoken before that his interlocutor remained profoundly surprised.
`It exists to a dangerous degree. My reports for the last twelve months
make it sufficiently clear.'

<P>`Your reports for the last twelve months,' State Councillor Wurmt began
in his gentle and dispassionate tone, `have been read by me. I failed to
discover why you wrote them at all.'

<P>A sad silence reigned for a time. Mr Verloc seemed to have swallowed
his tongue, and the other gazed at the papers on the table fixedly. At
last he gave them a slight push.

<P>`The state of affairs you expose there is assumed to exist as the first
condition of your employment. What is required at present is not writing,
but the bringing to light of a distinct, significant fact - I would almost
say of an alarming fact.'

<P>`I need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed to that end,'
Mr Verloc said, with convinced modulations in his conversational husky
tone. But the sense of being blinked at watchfully behind the blind glitter
of these eyeglasses on the other side of the table disconcerted him. He
stopped short with a gesture of absolute devotion. The useful hard-working,
if obscure member of the Embassy had an air of being impressed by some
newly born thought.

<P>`You are very corpulent,' he said.

<P>This observation, really of a psychological nature, and advanced with
the modest hesitation of an officeman more familiar with ink and paper
than with the requirements of active life, stung Mr Verloc in the manner
of a rude personal remark. He stepped back a pace.

<P>`Eh? What were you pleased to say?' he exclaimed, with husky resentment.

<P>The Chancellor d'Ambassade, entrusted with the conduct of this interview,
seemed to find it too much for him.

<P>`I think,' he said, `that you had better see Mr Vladimir. Yes, decidedly
I think you ought to see Mr Vladimir. Be good enough to wait here,' he
added, and went out with mincing steps.

<P>At once Mr Verloc passed his hand over his hair. A slight perspiration
had broken out of his forehead. He let the air escape from his pursed-up
lips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup. But when the servant
in brown appeared at the door silently, Mr Verloc had not moved an inch
from the place he had occupied throughout the interview. He had remained
motionless, as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls.

<P>He walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gas-jet, then up a flight
of winding stairs, and through a glazed and cheerful corridor on the first
floor. The footman threw open a door, and stood aside. The feet of Mr Verloc
felt a thick carpet. The room was large, with three windows; and a young
man with a shaven, big face, sitting in a roomy armchair before a vast
mahogany writing-table, said in French to the Chancellor d'Ambassade, who
was going out with the papers in his hand:

<P>`You are quite right, <I>mon cher</I>. He's fat - the animal.'

<P>Mr Vladimir, First Secretary, had a drawing-room reputation as an agreeable
and entertaining man. He was something of a favourite in society. His wit
consisted in discovering droll connections between incongruous ideas; and
when talking in that strain he sat well forward on his seat, with his left
hand raised, as if exhibiting his funny demonstrations between the thumb
and forefinger, while his round and clean-shaven face wore an expression
of merry perplexity.

<P>But there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way he looked
at Mr Verloc. Lying far back in the deep armchair, with squarely spread
elbows, and throwing one leg over a thick knee, he had with his smooth
and rosy countenance the air of a preternaturally thriving baby that will
not stand nonsense from anybody.

<P>`You understand French, I suppose?' he said.

<P>Mr Verloc stated huskily that he did. His whole vast bulk had a forward
inclination. He stood on the carpet in the middle of the room, clutching
his hat and stick in one hand; the other hung lifelessly by his side. He
muttered unobtrusively somewhere deep down in his throat something about
having done his military service in the French artillery. At once, with
contemptuous perversity, Mr Vladimir changed the language, and began to
speak idiomatic English without the slightest trace of a foreign accent.

<P>`Ah! Yes. Of course. Let's see. How much did you get for obtaining the
design of the improved breech-block of their new field-gun?'

<P>`Five years' rigorous confinement in a fortress,' Mr Verloc answered,
unexpectedly, but without any sign of feeling.

<P>`You got off easily,' was Mr Vladimir's comment. `And, anyhow, it served
you right for letting yourself get caught. What made you go in for that
sort of thing - eh?'

<P>Mr Verloc's husky conversational voice was heard speaking of youth,
of a fatal infatuation for an unworthy--

<P>`Aha! <I>Cherchez la femme</I>,' Mr Vladimir deigned to interrupt, unbending,
but without affability; there was, on the contrary, a touch of grimness
in his condescension. `How long have you been employed by the Embassy here?'
he asked.

<P>`Ever since the time of the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim,' Mr Verloc
answered in subdued tones, and protruding his lips sadly, in sign of sorrow
for the deceased diplomat. The First Secretary observed this play of physiognomy
steadily.

<P>`Ah! ever since... Well! What have you got to say for yourself?' he
asked, sharply.

<P>Mr Verloc answered with some surprise that he was not aware of having
anything special to say. He had been summoned by a letter - And he plunged
his hand busily into the side pocket of his overcoat, but before the mocking,
cynical watchfulness of Mr Vladimir, concluded to leave it there.

<P>`Bah!' said the latter. `What do you mean by getting out of condition
like this? You haven't got even the physique of your profession. You -
a member of a starving proletariat - never! You - a desperate socialist
or anarchist - which is it?'

<P>`Anarchist,' stated Mr Verloc in a deadened tone.

<P>`Bosh!' went on Mr Vladimir, without raising his voice. `You startled
old Wurmt himself. You wouldn't deceive an idiot. They all are that by-the-by,
but you seem to me simply impossible. So you began your connection with
us by stealing the French gun designs. And you got yourself caught. That
must have been very disagreeable to our Government. You don't seem to be
very smart.

<P>Mr Verloc tried to exculpate himself huskily.

<P>`As I've had occasion to observe before, a fatal infatuation for an
unworthy--'

<P>Mr Vladimir raised a large, white, plump hand.

<P>`Ah, yes. The unlucky attachment - of your youth. She got hold of the
money, and then sold you to the police - eh?'

<P>The doleful change in Mr Verloc's physiognomy, the momentary drooping
of his whole person, confessed that such was the regrettable case. Mr Vladimir's
hand clasped the ankle reposing on his knee. The sock was of dark blue
silk.

<P>`You see, that was not very clever of you. Perhaps you are too susceptible.'

<P>Mr Verloc intimated in a throaty, veiled murmur that he was no longer
young.

<P>`Oh! That's a failing which age does not cure,' Mr Vladimir remarked,
with sinister familiarity. `But no! You are too fat for that. You could
not have come to look' like this if you had been at all susceptible. I'll
tell you what I think is the matter: you are a lazy fellow. How long have
you been drawing pay from this Embassy?'

<P>`Eleven years,' was the answer, after a moment of sulky hesitation.
`I've been charged with several missions to London while His Excellency
Baron Stott-Wartenheim was still Ambassador in Paris. Then by his Excellency's
instructions I settled down in London. I am English.'

<P>`You are! Are you? Eh?'

<P>`A natural-born British subject,' Mr Verloc said, stolidly. `But my
father was French, and so--'

<P>`Never mind explaining,' interrupted the other. `I daresay you could
have been legally a Marshal of France and a Member of Parliament in England
- and then, indeed, you would have been of some use to our Embassy.'

<P>This flight of fancy provoked something like a faint smile on Mr Verloc's
face. Mr Vladimir retained an imperturbable gravity.

<P>`But, as I've said, you are a lazy fellow; you don't use your opportunities.
In the time of Baron Stott-Wartenheim we had a lot of soft-headed people
running this Embassy. They caused fellows of your sort to form a false
conception of the nature of a secret service fund. It is my business to
correct this misapprehension by telling you what the secret service is
not. It is not a philanthropic institution. I've had you called here on
purpose to tell you this.'

<P>Mr Vladimir observed the forced expression of bewilderment on Verloc's
face, and smiled sarcastically.

<P>`I see that you understand me perfectly. I daresay you are intelligent
enough for your work. What we want now is activity - activity.'

<P>On repeating this last word Mr Vladimir laid a long white forefinger
on the edge of the desk. Every trace of huskiness disappeared from Verloc's
voice. The nape of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar
of his overcoat. His lips quivered before they came widely open.

<P>`If you'll only be good enough to look up my record,' he boomed out
in his great, clear, oratorical bass, `you'll see I gave a warning only
three months ago on the occasion of the Grand Duke Romuald's visit to Paris,
which was telegraphed from here to the French police, and--'

<P>`Tut, tut!' broke out Mr Vladimir, with a frowning grimace. `The French
police had no use for your warning. Don't roar like this. What the devil
do you mean?'

<P>With a note of proud humility Mr Verloc apologized for forgetting himself.
His voice, famous for years at open-air meetings and at workmen's assemblies
in large halls, had contributed, he said, to his reputation of a good and
trustworthy comrade. It was, therefore, a part of his usefulness. It had
inspired confidence in his principles. `I was always put up to speak by
the leaders at a critical moment,' Mr Verloc declared, with obvious satisfaction.
There was no uproar above which he could not make himself heard, he added;
and suddenly he made a demonstration.

<P>`Allow me,' he said. With lowered forehead, without looking up, swiftly
and ponderously, he crossed the room to one of the french windows. As if
giving way to an uncontrollable impulse, he opened it a little. Mr Vladimir,
jumping up amazed from the depths of the armchair, looked over his shoulder;
and below, across the courtyard of the Embassy, well beyond the open gate,
could be seen the broad back of a policeman watching idly the gorgeous
perambulator of a wealthy baby being wheeled in state across the Square.

<P>`Constable!' said Mr Verloc, with no more effort than if he were whispering;
and Mr Vladimir burst into a laugh on seeing the policeman spin round as
if prodded by a sharp instrument. Mr Verloc shut the window quietly, and
returned to the middle of the room.

<P>`With a voice like that,' he said, putting on the husky conversational
pedal, `I was naturally trusted. And I knew what to say, too.'

<P>Mr Vladimir, arranging his cravat, observed him in the glass over the
mantelpiece.

<P>`I daresay you have the social revolutionary jargon by heart well enough,'
he said, contemptuously. `<I>Vox et</I>... You haven't ever studied Latin
- have you?'

<P>`No', growled Mr Verloc. `You did not expect me to know it. I belong
to the million. Who knows Latin? Only a few hundred imbeciles who aren't
fit to take care of themselves.'

<P>For some thirty seconds longer Mr Vladimir studied in the mirror the
fleshy profile, the gross bulk, of the man behind him. And at the same
time he had the advantage of seeing his own face, clean-shaved and round,
rosy about the gills, and with the thin, sensitive lips formed exactly
for the utterance of those delicate witticisms which had made him such
a favourite in the very highest society. Then he turned, and advanced into
the room with such determination that the very ends of his quaintly old-fashioned
bow necktie seemed to bristle with unspeakable menaces. The movement was
so swift and fierce that Mr Verloc, casting an oblique glance, quailed
inwardly. `Aha! You dare be impudent,' Mr Vladimir began, with an amazingly
guttural intonation not only utterly un-English, but absolutely un-European,
and startling even to Mr Verloc's experience of cosmopolitan slums. `You
dare! Well, I am going to speak English to you. Voice won't do. We have
no use for your voice. We don't want a voice. We want facts - startling
facts - damn you,' he added, with a sort of ferocious discretion, right
into Mr Verloc's face.

<P>`Don't you try to come over me with your Hyperborean manners.' Mr Verloc
defended himself, huskily, looking at the carpet. At this his interlocutor,
smiling mockingly above the bristling bow of his necktie, switched the
conversation into French.

<P>`You give yourself for an <I>agent provocateur</I>. The proper business
of an <I>agent provocateur</I> is to provoke. As far as I can judge from
your record kept here, you have done nothing to earn your money for the
last three years.'

<P>`Nothing!' exclaimed Verloc, stirring not a limb, and not raising his
eyes, bat with the note of sincere feeling in his tone. `I have several
times prevented what might have been--'

<P>`There is a proverb in this country which says prevention is better
than cure,' interrupted Mr Vladimir, throwing himself into the armchair.
`It is stupid in a general way. There is no end to prevention. But it is
characteristic. They dislike finality in this country. Don't you be too
English. And in this particular instance, don't be absurd. The evil is
already here. We don't want prevention - we want cure.'

<P>He paused, turned to the desk, and turning over some papers lying there,
spoke in a changed, business-like tone, without looking at Mr Verloc.

<P>`You know, of course, of the International Conference assembled in Milan?'

<P>Mr Verloc intimated hoarsely that he was in the habit of reading the
daily papers. To a further question his answer was that, of course, he
understood what he read. At this Mr Vladimir, smiling faintly at the documents
he was still scanning one after another, murmured `As long as it is not
written in Latin, I suppose.

<P>`Or Chinese,' added Mr Verloc, stolidly.

<P>`H'm. Some of your revolutionary friends' effusions are written in a
<I>charabia</I> every bit as incomprehensible as Chinese - `Mr Vladimir
let fall disdainfully a grey sheet of printed matter. `What are all these
leaflets headed F.P., with a hammer, pen, and torch crossed? What does
it mean, this F.P.?' Mr Verloc approached the imposing writing-table.

<P>`The Future of the Proletariat. It's a society,' he explained, standing
ponderously by the side of the armchair, `not anarchist in principle, but
open to all shades of revolutionary opinion.'

<P>`Are you in it?'

<P>`One of the Vice-Presidents,' Mr Verloc breathed out heavily; and the
First Secretary of the Embassy raised his head to look at him.

<P>`Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself,' he said, incisively. `Isn't
your society capable of anything else but printing this prophetic bosh
in blunt type on this filthy paper - eh? Why don't you do something? Look
here. I've this matter in hand now, and I tell you plainly that you will
have to earn your money. The good old Stott-Wartenheim times are over.
No work, no pay.'

<P>Mr Verloc felt a queer sensation of faintness in his stout legs. He
stepped back one pace, and blew his nose loudly.

<P>He was, in truth, startled and alarmed. The rusty London sunshine struggling
clear of the London mist shed a lukewarm brightness into the First Secretary's
private room: and in the silence Mr Verloc heard against a window-pane
the faint buzzing of a fly - his first fly of the year - heralding better
than any number of swallows the approach of spring. The useless fussing
of that tiny, energetic organism affected unpleasantly this big man threatened
in his indolence.

<P>In the pause Mr Vladimir formulated in his mind a series of disparaging
remarks concerning Mr Verloc's face and figure. The

<P>fellow was unexpectedly vulgar, heavy, and impudently unintelligent.
He looked uncommonly like a master plumber come to present his bill. The
First Secretary of the Embassy, from his occasional excursions into the
field of American humour, had formed a special notion of that class of
mechanic as the embodiment of fraudulent laziness and incompetency.

<P>This was then the famous and trusty secret agent, so secret that he
was never designated otherwise but by the symbol <A HREF="notes.html">D</A>
in the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim's official, semi-official, and confidential
correspondence; the celebrated agent <A HREF="notes.html">D</A> whose warnings
had the power to change the schemes and the dates of royal, imperial, grand-ducal
journeys, and sometimes cause them to be put off altogether! This fellow!
And Mr Vladimir indulged mentally in an enormous and derisive fit of merriment,
partly at his own astonishment, which he judged naive, but mostly at the
expense of the universally regretted Baron Stott-Wartenheim. His late Excellency,
whom the august favour of his Imperial master had imposed as Ambassador
upon several reluctant Ministers of Foreign Affairs, had enjoyed in his
lifetime a fame for an owlish, pessimistic gullibility. His Excellency
had the social revolution on the brain. He imagined himself to be a diplomatist
set apart by a special dispensation to watch the end of diplomacy, and
pretty nearly the end of the world, in a horrid, democratic upheaval. His
prophetic and doleful dispatches had been for years the joke of Foreign
Offices. He was said to have exclaimed on his death-bed (visited by his
Imperial friend and master): `Unhappy Europe! Thou shalt perish by the
moral insanity of thy children!' He was fated to be the victim of the first
humbugging rascal that came along, thought Mr Vladimir, smiling vaguely
at Mr Verloc.

<P>`You ought to venerate the memory of Baron Stott-Wartenheim,' he exclaimed,
suddenly.

<P>The lowered physiognomy of Mr Verloc expressed a sombre and weary annoyance.

<P>`Permit me to observe to you,' he said, `that I came here because I
was summoned by a peremptory letter. I have been here only twice before
in the last eleven years, and certainly never at eleven in the morning.
It isn't very wise to call me up like this. There is just a chance of being
seen. And that would be no joke for me.'

<P>Mr Vladimir shrugged his shoulders.

<P>`It would destroy my usefulness,' continued the other hotly.

<P>`That's your affair,' murmured Mr Vladimir, with soft brutality. `When
you cease to be useful you shall cease to be employed. Yes. Right off.
Cut short. You shall--' Mr Vladimir, frowning, paused, at a loss for a
sufficiently idiomatic expression, and instantly brightened up, with a
grin of beautifully white teeth. `You shall be chucked,' he brought out,
ferociously.

<P>Once more Mr Verloc had to react with all the force of his will against
that sensation of faintness running down one's legs which once upon a time
had inspired some poor devil with the felicitous expression: `My heart
went down into my boots.' Mr Verloc, aware of the sensation, raised his
head bravely.

<P>Mr Vladimir bore the look of heavy inquiry with perfect serenity.

<P>`What we want is to administer a tonic to the Conference in Milan, he
said, airily. `Its deliberations upon international action for the suppression
of political crime don't seem to get anywhere. England lags. This country
is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual liberty. It's intolerable
to think that all your friends have got only to come over to--'

<P>`In that way I have them all under my eye,' Mr Verloc interrupted, huskily.

<P>`It would be much more to the point to have them all under lock and
key. England must be brought into line. The imbecile bourgeoisie of this
country make themselves the accomplices of the very people whose aim is
to drive them out of their houses to starve in ditches. And they have the
political power still, if they only had the sense to use it for their preservation.
I suppose you agree that the middle classes are stupid?'

<P>Mr Verloc agreed hoarsely. `They are.'

<P>`They have no imagination. They are blinded by an idiotic vanity. What
they want just now is a jolly good scare. This is the psychological moment
to set your friends to work. I have had you called here to develop to you
my idea.'

<P>And Mr Vladimir developed his idea from on high, with scorn and condescension,
displaying at the same time an amount of ignorance as to the real aims,
thoughts, and methods of the revolutionary world which filled the silent
Mr Verloc with inward consternation. He confounded causes with effects
more than was excusable; the most distinguished propagandists with impulsive
bomb throwers; assumed organization where in the nature of things it could
not exist; spoke of the social revolutionary party one moment as of a perfectly
disciplined army, where the word of chiefs was supreme, and at another
as if it had been the loosest association of desperate brigands that ever
camped in a mountain gorge. Once Mr Verloc had opened his mouth for a protest,
but the raising of a shapely, large white hand arrested him. Very soon
he became too appalled to even try to protest. He listened in a stillness
of dread which resembled the immobility of profound attention.

<P>`A series of outrages,' Mr Vladimir continued, calmly, `executed here
in this country; not only <I>planned</I> here - that would not do - they
would not mind. Your friends could set half the Continent on fire without
influencing the public opinion here in favour of a universal repressive
legislation. They will not look outside their backyard here.'

<P>Mr Verloc cleared his throat, but his heart failed him, and he said
nothing.

<P>`These outrages need not be especially sanguinary,' Mr Vladimir went
on, as if delivering a scientific lecture, `but they must sufficiently
startling - effective. Let them be directed against buildings, for instance.
What is the fetish of the hour that all the bourgeoisie recognize - eh,
Mr Verloc?'

<P>Mr Verloc opened his hands and shrugged his shoulders slightly.

<P>`You are too lazy to think,' was Mr Vladimir's comment upon that gesture.
`Pay attention to what I say. The fetish of today is neither royalty nor
religion. Therefore the palace and the church should be left alone. You
understand what I mean, Mr Verloc?'

<P>The dismay and the scorn of Mr Verloc found vent in an attempt at levity.

<P>`Perfectly. But what of the Embassies? A series of attacks on the various
Embassies,' he began; but he could not withstand the cold, watchful stare
of the First Secretary.

<P>`You can be facetious, I see,' the latter observed, carelessly. `That's
all right. It may enliven your oratory at socialistic congresses. But this
room is no place for it. It would be infinitely safer for you to follow
carefully what I am saying. As you are being called upon to furnish facts
instead of cock-and-bull stories, you had better try to make your profit
off what I am taking the trouble to explain to you. The sacrosanct fetish
of today is science. Why don't you get some of your friends to go for that
wooden-faced panjandrum - eh? Is it not part of these institutions which
must be swept away before the F.P. comes along?'

<P>Mr Verloc said nothing. He was afraid to open his lips lest a groan
should escape him.

<P>`This is what you should try for. An attempt upon a crowned head or
on a president is sensational enough in a way, but not so much as it used
to be. It has entered into the general conception of the existence of all
chiefs of state. It's almost conventional - especially since so many presidents
have been assassinated. Now let us take an outrage upon - say, a church.
Horrible enough at first sight, no doubt, and yet not so effective as a
person of an ordinary mind might think. No matter how revolutionary and
anarchist in inception, there would be fools enough to give such an outrage
the character of a religious manifestation. And that would detract from
the especial alarming significance we wish to give to the act. A murderous
attempt on a restaurant or a theatre would suffer in the same way from
the suggestion of non-political passion; the exasperation of a hungry man,
an act of social revenge. All this is used up; it is no longer instructive
as an object lesson in revolutionary anarchism. Every newspaper has ready-made
phrases to explain such manifestations away. I am about to give you the
philosophy of bomb throwing from my point of view; from the point of view
you pretend to have been serving for the last eleven years. I will try
not to talk above your head. The sensibilities of the class you are attacking
are soon blunted. Property seems to them an indestructible thing. You can't
count upon their emotions either of pity or fear for very long. A bomb
outrage to have any influence on public opinion now must go beyond the
intention of vengeance or terrorism. It must be purely destructive. It
must be that, and only that, beyond the faintest suspicion of any other
object. You anarchists should make it clear that you are perfectly determined
to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation. But how to get that
appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle classes so that
there should be no mistake? That's the question. By directing your blows
at something outside the ordinary passions of humanity is the answer. Of
course, there is art. A bomb in the National Gallery would make some noise.
But it would not be serious enough. Art has never been their fetish. It's
like breaking a few back windows in a man's house; whereas, if you want
to make him really sit up, you must try at least to raise the roof. There
would be some screaming of course, but from whom? Artists - art critics
and such like - people of no account. Nobody minds what they say. But there
is learning - science. Any imbecile that has got an income believes in
that. He does not know why, but he believes it matters somehow. It is the
sacrosanct fetish. All the damned professors are radicals at heart. Let
them know that their great panjandrum has got to go, too, to make room
for the Future of the Proletariat. A howl from all these intellectual idiots
is bound to help forward the labours of the Milan Conference. They will
be writing to the papers. Their indignation would be above suspicion, no
material interests being openly at stake, and it will alarm every selfishness
of the class which should be impressed. They believe that in some mysterious
way science is at the source of their material prosperity. They do. And
the absurd ferocity of such a demonstration will affect them more profoundly
than the mangling of a whole street - or theatre - full of their own kind.
To that last they can always say: "Oh! it's mere class hate." But what
is one to say to an act of destructive ferocity so absurd as to be incomprehensible,
inexplicable, almost unthinkable; in fact, mad? Madness alone is truly
terrifying, inasmuch as you cannot placate it either by threats, persuasion,
or bribes. Moreover, I am a civilized man. I would never dream of directing
you to organize a mere butchery, even if I expected the best results from
it. But I wouldn't expect from a butchery the result I want. Murder is
always with us. It is almost an institution. The demonstration must be
against learning - science. But not every science will do. The attack must
have all the shocking senselessness of gratuitous blasphemy. Since bombs
are your means of expression, it would be really telling if one could throw
a bomb into pure mathematics. But that is impossible. I have been trying
to educate you; I have expounded to you the higher philosophy of your usefulness,
and suggested to you some serviceable arguments. The practical application
of my teaching interests <I>you</I> mostly. But from the moment I have
undertaken to interview you I have also given some attention to the practical
aspect of the question. What do you think of having a go at astronomy?'

<P>For some time already Mr Verloc's immobility by the side of the armchair
resembled a state of collapsed coma - a sort of passive insensibility interrupted
by slight convulsive starts, such as may be observed in the domestic dog
having a nightmare on the hearthrug. And it was in an uneasy, doglike growl
that he repeated the word:

<P>`Astronomy.'

<P>He had not recovered thoroughly as yet from the state of bewilderment
brought about by the effort to follow Mr Vladimir's rapid, incisive utterance.
It had overcome his power of assimilation. It had made him angry. This
anger was complicated by incredulity. And suddenly it dawned upon him that
all this was an elaborate joke. Mr Vladimir exhibited his white teeth in
a smile, with dimples on his round, full face posed with a complacent inclination
above the bristling bow of his necktie. The favourite of intelligent society
women had assumed his drawing-room attitude accompanying the delivery of
delicate witticisms. Sitting well forward, his white hand upraised, he
seemed to hold delicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety
of his suggestion.

<P>`There could be nothing better. Such an outrage combines the greatest
possible regard for humanity with the most alarming display of ferocious
imbecility. I defy the ingenuity of journalists to persuade their public
that any given member of the proletariat can have a personal grievance
against astronomy. Starvation itself could hardly be dragged in there -
eh? And there are other advantages. The whole civilized world has heard
of Greenwich. The very bootblacks in the basement of Charing Cross Station
know something of it. See?'

<P>The features of Mr Vladimir, so well known in the best society by their
humorous urbanity, beamed with cynical self-satisfaction, which would have
astonished the intelligent women his wit entertained so exquisitely. `Yes,'
he continued, with a contemptuous smile, `the blowing up of the first meridian
is bound to raise a howl of execration.'

<P>`A difficult business,' Mr Verloc mumbled, feeling that this was the
only safe thing to say.

<P>`What is the matter? Haven't you the whole gang under your hand? The
very pick of the basket? That old terrorist Yundt is here. I see him walking
about Piccadilly in his green havelock almost every day. And Michaelis,
the ticket-of-leave apostle - you don't mean to say you don't know where
he is? Because if you don't, I can tell you,' Mr Vladimir went on menacingly.
`If you imagine that you are the only one in the secret fund list, you
are mistaken.'

<P>This perfectly gratuitous suggestion caused Mr Verloc to shuffle his
feet slightly.

<P>`And the whole Lausanne lot - eh? Haven't they been flocking over here
at the first hint of the Milan Conference? This is an absurd country.'

<P>`It will cost money,' Mr Verloc said, by a sort of instinct.

<P>`That cock won't fight,' Mr Vladimir retorted, with an amazingly genuine
English accent. `You'll get your screw every month, and no more till something
happens. And if nothing happens very soon you won't get even that. What's
your ostensible occupation? What are you supposed to live by?'

<P>`I keep a shop,' answered Mr Verloc. `A shop! What sort of shop?' `Stationery,
newspapers. My wife--'

<P>`Your what?' interrupted Mr Vladimir in his guttural Central Asian tones.

<P>`My wife.' Mr Verloc raised his husky voice slightly. `I am married.'

<P>`That be damned for a yarn,' exclaimed the other in unfeigned astonishment.
`Married! And you a professed anarchist, too! What is this confounded nonsense?
But I suppose it's merely a manner of speaking. Anarchists don't marry.
It's well known. They can't. It would be apostasy.

<P>`My wife isn't one,' Mr Verloc mumbled, sulkily. `Moreover, it's no
concern of yours.'

<P>`Oh, yes, it is,' snapped Mr Vladimir. `I am beginning to be convinced
that you are not at all the man for the work you've been employed on. Why,
you must have discredited yourself completely in your own world by your
marriage. Couldn't you have managed without? This is your virtuous attachment
- eh? What with one sort of attachment and another you are doing away with
your usefulness.'

<P>Mr Verloc, puffing out his cheeks, let the air escape violently, and
that was all. He had armed himself with patience. It was not to be tried
much longer. The First Secretary became suddenly very curt, detached, final.

<P>`You may go now,' he said. `A dynamite outrage must be provoked. I give
you a month. The sittings of the Conference are suspended. Before it reassembles
again something must have happened here, or your connection with us ceases.'

<P>He changed the note once more with an unprincipled versatility.

<P>`Think over my philosophy, Mr - Mr - Verloc,' he said, with a sort of
chaffing condescension, waving his hand towards the door. `Go for the first
meridian. You don't know the middle classes as well as I do. Their sensibilities
are jaded. The first meridian. Nothing better, and nothing easier, I should
think.'

<P>He had got up, and with his thin sensitive lips twitching humorously,
watched in the glass over the mantelpiece Mr Verloc backing out of the
room heavily, hat and stick in hand. The door closed.

<P>The footman in trousers, appearing suddenly in the corridor, led Mr
Verloc another way out and through a small door in the corner of the courtyard.
The porter standing at the gate ignored his exit completely; and Mr Verloc
retraced the path of his morning's pilgrimage as if in a dream - an angry
dream. This detachment from the material world was so complete that, though
the mortal envelope of Mr Verloc had not hastened unduly along the streets,
that part of him to which it would be unwarrantably rude to refuse immortality,
found itself at the shop door all at once, as borne from west to east on
the wings of a great wind. He walked straight behind the counter, and sat
down on a wooden chair that stood there. No one appeared to disturb his
solitude. Stevie, put into a green baize apron, was now sweeping and dusting
upstairs, intent and conscientious, as though he were playing at it; and
Mrs Verloc, warned in the kitchen by the clatter of the cracked bell, had
merely come to the glazed door of the parlour, and putting the curtain
aside a little, had peered into the dim shop. Seeing her husband sitting
there shadowy and bulky, with his hat tilted far back on his head, she
had at once returned to her stove.

<P>An hour or more later she took the green baize apron off her brother
Stevie, and instructed him to wash his hands and face in the peremptory
tone she had used in that connection for fifteen years or so - ever since
she had, in fact, ceased to attend to the boy's hands and face herself.
She spared presently a glance away from her dishing-up for the inspection
of that face and those hands which Stevie, approaching the kitchen table,
offered for her approval with an air of self-assurance hiding a perpetual
residue of anxiety. Formerly the anger of the father was the supremely
effective sanction of these rites, but Mr Verloc's placidity in domestic
life would have made all mention of anger incredible - even to poor Stevie's
nervousness. The theory was that Mr Verloc would have been inexpressibly
pained and shocked by any deficiency of cleanliness at meal times. Winnie
after the death of her father found considerable consolation in the feeling
that she need no longer tremble for poor Stevie. She could not bear to
see the boy hurt. It maddened her. As a little girl she had often faced
with blazing eyes the irascible licensed victualler in defence of her brother.
Nothing now in Mrs Verloc's appearance could lead one to suppose that she
was capable of a passionate demonstration.

<P>She finished her dishing-up. The table was laid in the parlour. Going
to the foot of the stairs she screamed out `Mother!' Then opening the glazed
door leading to the shop, `Adolf!' Mr Verloc had not changed his position;
he had not apparently stirred a limb for an hour and a half. He got up
heavily, and came to his dinner in his overcoat and with his hat on, without
uttering a word. His silence in itself had nothing startlingly unusual
in this household, hidden in the shades of the sordid street seldom touched
by the sun, behind the dim shop with its wares of disreputable rubbish.
Only that day Mr Verloc's taciturnity was so obviously thoughtful that
the two women were impressed by it. They sat silent themselves, keeping
a watchful eye on poor Stevie, lest he should break out into one of his
fits of loquacity. He faced Mr Verloc across the table, and remained very
good and quiet, staring vacantly. The endeavour to keep him from making
himself objectionable in any way to the master of the house put no inconsiderable
anxiety into these two women's lives. `The boy,' as they alluded to him
softly between themselves, had been a source of that sort of anxiety almost
from the very day of his birth. The late licensed victualler's humiliation
at having such a very peculiar boy for a son manifested itself by a propensity
to brutal treatment; for he was a person of fine sensibilities, and his
sufferings as a man and a father were perfectly genuine. Afterwards Stevie
had to be kept from making himself a nuisance to the single gentlemen lodgers,
who are themselves a queer lot, and are easily aggrieved. And there was
always the anxiety of his mere existence to face. Visions of a workhouse
infirmary for her child had haunted the old woman in the basement breakfast-room
of the decayed Belgravian house. `If you had net found such a good husband,
my dear,' she used to say to her daughter, `I don't know what would have
become of that poor boy.

<P>Mr Verloc extended as much recognition to Stevie as a man not particularly
fond of animals may give to his wife's beloved cat; and this recognition,
benevolent and perfunctory, was essentially of the same quality. Both women
admitted to themselves that not much more could be reasonably expected.
It was enough to earn for Mr Verloc the old woman's reverential gratitude.
In the early days, made sceptical by the trials of friendless life, she
used sometimes to ask anxiously: `You don't think, my dear, that Mr Verloc
is getting tired of seeing Stevie about?' To this Winnie replied habitually
by a slight toss of her head. Once, however, she retorted, with a rather
grim pertness: `He'll have to get tired of me first.' A long silence ensued.
The mother, with her feet propped up on a stool, seemed to be trying to
get to the bottom of that answer, whose feminine profundity had struck
her all of a heap. She had never really understood why Winnie had married
Mr Verloc. It was very sensible of her, and evidently had turned out for
the best, but the girl might have naturally hoped to find somebody of a
more suitable age. There had been a steady young fellow, only son of a
butcher in the next street, helping his father in business, with whom Winnie
had been walking out with obvious gusto. He was dependent on his father,
it is true; but the business was good, and his prospects excellent. He
took her girl to the theatre on several evenings. Then just as she began
to dread to hear of their engagement (for what could she have done with
that big house alone, with Stevie on her hands), that romance came to an
abrupt end, and Winnie went about looking very dull. But Mr Verloc, turning
up providentially to occupy the first-floor front bedroom, there had been
no more question of the young butcher. It was clearly providential.
