Directly the cargo boat had slipped away from the wharf and got lost in
the darkness of the harbour the Europeans of Sulaco separated, to prepare
for the coming of the Monterist regime, which was approaching Sulaco from
the mountains, as well as from the sea.

<P>This bit of manual work in loading the silver was their last concerted
action. It ended the three days of danger, during which, according to the
newspaper press of Europe, their energy had preserved the town from the
calamities of popular disorder. At the shore end of the jetty, Captain
Mitchell said good night and turned back. His intention was to walk the
planks of the wharf till the steamer from Esmeralda turned up. The engineers
of the railway staff, collecting their Basque and Italian workmen, marched
them away to the railway yards, leaving the Custom House, so well defended
on the first day of the riot, standing open to the four winds of heaven.
Their men had conducted themselves bravely and faithfully during the famous
`three days' of Sulaco. In a great part this faithfulness and that courage
had been exercised in self-defence rather than in the cause of those material
interests to which Charles Gould had pinned his faith. Amongst the cries
of the mob not the least loud had been the cry of death to foreigners.
It was, indeed, a lucky circumstance for Sulaco that the relations of those
imported workmen with the people of the country had been uniformly bad
from the first.

<P>Dr Monygham, going to the door of Viola's kitchen, observed this retreat
marking the end of the foreign interference, this withdrawal of the army
of material progress from the field of Costaguana revolutions.

<P>Algarroba torches carried on the outskirts of the moving body sent their
penetrating aroma into his nostrils. Their light, sweeping along the front
of the house, made the letters of the inscription, `Albergo d'Italia Una',
leap out black from end to end of the long wall. His eyes blinked in the
clear blaze. Several young men, mostly fair and tall, shepherding this
mob of dark bronzed heads, surmounted by the glint of slanting rifle barrels,
nodded to him familiarly as they went by. The doctor was a well-known character.
Some of them wondered what he was doing there. Then, on the flank of their
workmen they tramped on, following the line of rails.

<P>`Withdrawing your people from the harbour?' said the doctor, addressing
himself to the chief engineer of the railway, who had accompanied Charles
Gould so far on his way to the town, walking by the side of the horse,
with his hand on the saddle-bow. They had stopped just outside the open
door to let the workmen cross the road.

<P>`As quick as I can. We are not a political faction,' answered the engineer,
meaningly. `And we are not going to give our new rulers a handle against
the railway. You approve me, Gould?'

<P>`Absolutely,' said Charles Gould's impassive voice, high up and outside
the dim parallelogram of light falling on the road through the open door.

<P>With Sotillo expected from one side, and Pedro Montero from the other,
the engineer-in-chief's only anxiety now was to avoid a collision with
either. Sulaco, for him, was a railway station, a terminus, workshops,
a great accumulation of stores. As against the mob the railway defended
its property, but politically the railway was neutral. He was a brave man;
and in that spirit of neutrality he had carried proposals of truce to the
self-appointed chiefs of the popular party, the deputies Fuentes and Gamacho.
Bullets were still flying about when he had crossed the Plaza on that mission,
waving above his head a white napkin belonging to the table linen of the
Amarilla Club.

<P>He was rather proud of this exploit; and reflecting that the doctor,
busy all day with the wounded in the <I>patio</I> of the Casa Gould, had
not had time to hear the news, he began a succinct narrative. He had communicated
to them the intelligence from the Construction Camp as to Pedro Montero.
The brother of the victorious general, he had assured them, could be expected
at Sulaco at any time now. This news (as he anticipated), when shouted
out of the window by Senor Gamacho, induced a rush of the mob along the
Campo Road towards Rincon. The two deputies also, after shaking hands with
him effusively, mounted and galloped off to meet the great man. `I have
misled them a little as to the time,' the chief engineer confessed. `However
hard he rides, he can scarcely get here before the morning. But my object
is attained. I've secured several hours' peace for the losing party. But
I did not tell them anything about Sotillo, for fear they would take it
into their heads to try to get hold of the harbour again, either to oppose
him or welcome him -- there's no saying which. There was Gould's silver,
on which rests the remnant of our hopes. Decoud's retreat had to be thought
of, too. I think the railway has done pretty well by its friends without
compromising itself hopelessly. Now the parties must be left to themselves.'

<P>`Costaguana for the Costaguaneros,' interjected the doctor, sardonically.
`It is a fine country, and they have raised a fine crop of hates, vengeance,
murder, and rapine -- those sons of the country.'

<P>`Well, I am one of them,' Charles Gould's voice sounded, calmly, `and
I must be going on to see to my own crop of trouble. My wife has driven
straight on, doctor?'

<P>`Yes. All was quiet on this side. Mrs Gould has taken the two girls
with her.'

<P>Charles Gould rode on, and the engineer-in-chief followed the doctor
indoors.

<P>`That man is calmness personified,' he said, appreciatively, dropping
on a bench, and stretching his well-shaped legs in cycling stockings nearly
across the doorway. `He must be extremely sure of himself.'

<P>`If that's all he is sure of, then he is sure of nothing,' said the
doctor. He had perched himself again on the end of the table. He nursed
his cheek in the palm of one hand, while the other sustained the elbow.
`It is the last thing a man ought to be sure of.' The candle, half-consumed
and burning dimly with a long wick, lighted up from below his inclined
face, whose expression affected by the drawn-in cicatrices in the cheeks,
had something vaguely unnatural, an exaggerated remorseful bitterness.
As he sat there he had the air of meditating upon sinister things. The
engineer-in-chief gazed at him for a time before he protested.

<P>`I really don't see that. For me there seems to be nothing else. However--'

<P>He was a wise man, but he could not quite conceal his contempt for that
sort of paradox; in fact, Dr Monygham was not liked by the Europeans of
Sulaco. His outward aspect of an outcast, which he preserved even in Mrs
Gould's drawing-room, provoked unfavourable criticism. There could be no
doubt of his intelligence; and as he had lived for over twenty years in
the country, the pessimism of his outlook could not be altogether ignored.
But instinctively, in self-defence of their activities and hopes, his hearers
put it to the account of some hidden imperfection in the man's character.
It was known that many years before, when quite young, he had been made
by Guzman Bento chief medical officer of the army. Not one of the Europeans
then in the service of Costaguana had been so much liked and trusted by
the fierce old Dictator.

<P>Afterwards his story was not so clear. It lost itself amongst the innumerable
tales of conspiracies and plots against the tyrant as a stream is lost
in an arid belt of sandy country before it emerges, diminished and troubled,
perhaps, on the other side. The doctor made no secret of it that he had
lived for years in the wildest parts of the Republic, wandering with almost
unknown Indian tribes in the great forests of the far interior where the
great rivers have their sources. But it was mere aimless wandering; he
had written nothing, collected nothing, brought nothing for science out
of the twilight of the forests, which seemed to cling to his battered personality
limping about Sulaco, where it had drifted in casually, only to get stranded
on the shores of the sea.

<P>It was also known that he had lived in a state of destitution till the
arrival of the Goulds from Europe. Don Carlos and Dona Emilia had taken
up the mad English doctor, when it became apparent that for all his savage
independence he could be tamed by kindness. Perhaps it was only hunger
that had tamed him. In years gone by he had certainly been acquainted with
Charles Gould's father in Sta Marta; and now, no matter what were the dark
passages of his history, as the medical officer of the San Tome mine he
became a recognized personality. He was recognized, but not unreservedly
accepted. So much defiant eccentricity and such an outspoken scorn for
mankind seemed to point to mere recklessness of judgement, the bravado
of guilt. Besides, since he had become again of some account, vague whispers
had been heard that years ago, when fallen into disgrace and thrown into
prison by Guzman Bento at the time of the so-called Great Conspiracy, he
had betrayed some of his best friends amongst the conspirators. Nobody
pretended to believe that whisper; the whole story of the Great Conspiracy
was hopelessly involved and obscure; it is admitted in Costaguana that
there never had been a conspiracy except in the diseased imagination of
the Tyrant; and, therefore, nothing and no one to betray; though the most
distinguished Costaguaneros had been imprisoned and executed upon that
accusation. The procedure had dragged on for years, decimating the better
class like a pestilence. The mere expression of sorrow for the fate of
executed kinsmen had been punished with death. Don Jose Avellanos was perhaps
the only one living who knew the whole story of those unspeakable cruelties.
He had suffered from them himself, and he, with a shrug of the shoulders
and a nervous, jerky gesture of the arm, was wont to put away from him,
as it were, every allusion to it. But whatever the reason, Dr Monygham,
a personage in the administration of the Gould Concession, treated with
reverent awe by the miners, and indulged in his peculiarities by Mrs Gould,
remained somehow outside the pale.

<P>It was not from any liking for the doctor that the engineer-in-chief
had lingered in the inn upon the plain. He liked old Viola much better.
He had come to look upon the Albergo d'Italia Una as a dependence of the
railway. Many of his subordinates had their quarters there. Mrs Gould's
interest in the family conferred upon it a sort of distinction. The engineer-in-chief,
with an army of workers under his orders, appreciated the moral influence
of the old Garibaldino upon his countrymen. His austere, old-world Republicanism
had a severe, soldier-like standard of faithfulness and duty, as if the
world were a battlefield where men had to fight for the sake of universal
love and brotherhood, instead of a more or less large share of booty.

<P>`Poor old chap!' he said, after he had heard the doctor's account of
Teresa. `He'll never be able to keep the place going by himself. I shall
be sorry.'

<P>`He's quite alone up there,' grunted Dr Monygham, with a toss of his
heavy head towards the narrow staircase. `Every living soul has cleared
out, and Mrs Gould took the girls away just now. It might not be over-safe
for them out here before very long. Of course, as a doctor I can do nothing
more here; but she has asked me to stay with old Viola, and as I have no
horse to get back to the mine, where I ought to be, I made no difficulty
to stay. They can do without me in the town.'

<P>`I have a good mind to remain with you, doctor, till we see whether
anything happens tonight at the harbour,' declared the engineer-in-chief.
`He must not be molested by Sotillo's soldiery, who may push on as far
as this at once. Sotillo used to be very cordial to me at the Goulds' and
at the club. How that man'll ever dare to look any of his friends here
in the face I can't imagine.'

<P>`He'll no doubt begin by shooting some of them to get over the first
awkwardness,' said the doctor. `Nothing in this country serves better your
military man who has changed sides than a few summary executions.' He spoke
with a gloomy positiveness that left no room for protest. The engineer-in-chief
did not attempt any. He simply nodded several times regretfully, then said:

<P>`He took a slightly different view,' the doctor said. `I heard him declare
in this very room that it would be the most desperate affair of his life.
He made a sort of verbal will here in my hearing, appointing old Viola
his executor; and, by Jove! do you know, he -- he's not grown rich by his
fidelity to you good people of the railway and the harbour. I suppose he
obtains some -- how do you say that? -- some spiritual value for his labours,
or else I don't know why the devil he should be faithful to you, Gould,
Mitchell, or anybody else. He knows this country well. He knows, for instance,
that Gamacho, the Deputy from javira, has been nothing else but a <I>tramposo</I>
of the commonest sort, a petty pedlar of the Campo, till he managed to
get enough goods on credit from Anzani to open a little store in the wilds,
and got himself elected by the drunken <I>mozos</I> that hang about the
<I>estancias</I> and the poorest sort of <I>rancheros</I> who were in his
debt. And Gamacho, who tomorrow will be probably one of our high officials,
is a stranger, too -- an <I>isleno</I>. He might have been a <I>cargador</I>
on the O.S.N. wharf had he not (the <I>posadero</I> of Rincon is ready
to swear it) murdered a pedlar in the woods and stolen his pack to begin
life on. And do you think that Gamacho, then, would have ever become a
hero with the democracy of this place, like our Capataz? Of course not.
He isn't half the man. No; decidedly, I think that Nostromo is a fool.'

<P>The doctor's talk was distasteful to the builder of railways. `It is
impossible to argue that point,' he said, philosophically. `Each man has
his gifts. You should have heard Gamacho haranguing his friends in the
street. He has a howling voice, and he shouted like mad, lifting his clenched
fist right above his head, and throwing his body half out of the window.
At every pause the rabble below yelled, "Down with the Oligarchs! <I>Viva
la libertad</I>!" Fuentes inside looked extremely miserable. You know,
he is the brother of Jorge Fuentes, who has been Minister of the Interior
for six months or so, some few years back. Of course, he has no conscience;
but he is a man of birth and education -- at one time the director of the
Customs of Cayta. That idiot-brute Gamacho fastened himself upon him with
his following of the lowest rabble. His sickly fear of that ruffian was
the most rejoicing sight imaginable.'

<P>He got up and went to the door to look out towards the harbour. `All
quiet,' he said; `I wonder if Sotillo really means to turn up here?'
