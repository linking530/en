All the morning Nostromo had kept his eye from afar on the Casa Viola,
even in the thick of the hottest scrimmage near the Custom House. `If I
see smoke rising over there,' he thought to himself, `they are lost.' Directly
the mob had broken he pressed with a small band of Italian workmen in that
direction, which, indeed, was the shortest line towards the town. That
part of the rabble he was pursuing seemed to think of making a stand under
the house; a volley fired by his followers from behind an aloe hedge made
the rascals fly. In a gap chopped out for the rails of the harbour branch-line
Nostromo appeared, mounted on his silver-grey mare. He shouted, sent after
them one shot from his revolver, and galloped up to the cafe window. He
had an idea that old Giorgio would choose that part of the house for a
refuge.

<P>His voice had penetrated to them, sounding breathlessly hurried: `<I>Hola!
vecchio! O, vecchio!</I> Is it all well with you in there?'

<P>`You see--' murmured old Viola to his wife.

<P>Signora Teresa was silent now. Outside Nostromo laughed.

<P>`I can hear the <I>padrona</I> is not dead.'

<P>`You have done your best to kill me with fear,' cried Signora Teresa.
She wanted to say something more, but her voice failed her.

<P>Linda raised her eyes to her face for a moment, but old Giorgio shouted
apologetically:

<P>`She is a little upset.'

<P>Outside Nostromo shouted back with another laugh:

<P>`She cannot upset me.'

<P>Signora Teresa found her voice.

<P>`It is what I say. You have no heart -- and you have no conscience,
Gian' Battista--'

<P>They heard him wheel his horse away from the shutters. The party he
led were babbling excitedly in Italian and Spanish, inciting each other
to the pursuit. He put himself at their head, crying, `<I>Avanti!</I>'

<P>`He has not stopped very long with us. There is no praise from strangers
to be got here,' Signora Teresa said, tragically. `<I>Avanti!</I> Yes!
That is all he cares for. To be first somewhere -- somehow -- to be first
with these English. They will be showing him to everybody. "This is our
Nostromo!"' She laughed ominously. `What a name! What is that? Nostromo?
He would take a name that is properly no word from them.'

<P>Meantime Giorgio, with tranquil movements, had been unfastening the
door; the flood of light fell on Signora Teresa, with her two girls gathered
to her side, a picturesque woman in a pose of maternal exaltation. Behind
her the wall was dazzlingly white, and the crude colours of the Garibaldi
lithograph paled in the sunshine.

<P>Old Viola, at the door, moved his arm upwards as if referring all his
quick, fleeting thoughts to the picture of his old chief on the wall. Even
when he was cooking for the `<I>signori inglesi</I>' -- the engineers (he
was a famous cook, though the kitchen was a dark place) -- he was, as it
were, under the eye of the great man who had led him in a glorious struggle
where, under the walls of Gaeta, tyranny would have expired for ever had
it not been for that accursed Piedmontese race of kings and ministers.
When sometimes a frying-pan caught fire during a delicate operation with
some shredded onions, and the old man was seen backing out of the doorway,
swearing and coughing violently in an acrid cloud of smoke, the name of
Cavour -- the arch intriguer sold to kings and tyrants -- could be heard
involved in imprecations against the China girls, cooking in general, and
the brute of a country where he was reduced to live for the lover of liberty
that traitor had strangled.

<P>Then Signora Teresa, all in black, issuing from another door, advanced,
portly and anxious, inclining her fine, black-browed head, opening her
arms, and crying in a profound tone --

<P>`Giorgio! thou passionate man! <I>Misericordia divina!</I> In the sun
like this! He will make himself ill.'

<P>At her feet the hens made off in all directions, with immense strides;
if there were any engineers from up the line staying in Sulaco, a young
English face or two would appear at the billiard-room occupying one end
of the house; but at the other end, in the cafe, Luis, the mulatto, took
good care not to show himself. The Indian girls, with hair like flowing
black manes, and dressed only in a shift and short petticoat, stared dully
from under the square-cut fringes on their foreheads; the noisy frizzling
of fat had stopped, the fumes floated upwards in sunshine, a strong smell
of burnt onions hung in the drowsy heat, enveloping the house; and the
eye lost itself in a vast flat expanse of grass to the west, as if the
plain between the Sierra overtopping Sulaco and the coast range away there
towards Esmeralda had been as big as half the world.

<P>Signora Teresa, after an impressive pause, remonstrated:

<P>`Eh, Giorgio! Leave Cavour alone and take care of yourself now we are
lost in this country all alone with the two children, because you cannot
live under a king.'

<P>And while she looked at him she would sometimes put her hand hastily
to her side with a short twitch of her fine lips and a knitting of her
black, straight eyebrows like a flicker of angry pain or an angry thought
on her handsome, regular features.

<P>It was pain; she suppressed the twinge. It had come to her first a few
years after they had left Italy to emigrate to America and settle at last
in Sulaco after wandering from town to town, trying shopkeeping in a small
way here and there; and once an organized enterprise of fishing -- in Maldonado
-- for Giorgio, like the great Garibaldi, had been a sailor in his time.

<P>Sometimes she had no patience with pain. For years its gnawing had been
part of the landscape embracing the glitter of the harbour under the wooded
spurs of the range; and the sunshine itself was heavy and dull -- heavy
with pain -- not like the sunshine of her girlhood, in which middle-aged
Giorgio had wooed her gravely and passionately on the shores of the gulf
of Spezzia.

<P>`You go in at once, Giorgio,' she directed. `One would think you do
not wish to have any pity on me -- with four Signori Inglesi staying in
the house.'

<P>`<I>Va bene, va bene</I>,' Giorgio would mutter.

<P>He obeyed. The Signori Inglesi would require their midday meal presently.
He had been one of the immortal and invincible band of liberators who had
made the mercenaries of tyranny fly like chaff before a hurricane, `<I>un
uragano terribile</I>'. But that was before he was married and had children;
and before tyranny had reared its head again amongst the traitors who had
imprisoned Garibaldi, his hero.

<P>There were three doors in the front of the house, and each afternoon
the Garibaldino could be seen at one or another of them with his big bush
of white hair, his arms folded, his legs crossed, leaning back his leonine
head against the lintel, and looking up the wooded slopes of the foothills
at the snowy dome of Higuerota. The front of his house threw off a black
long rectangle of shade, broadening slowly over the soft ox-cart track.
Through the gaps, chopped out in the oleander hedges, the harbour branch
railway, laid out temporarily on the level of the plain, curved away its
shining parallel ribbons on a belt of scorched and withered grass within
sixty yards of the end of the house. In the evening the empty material
trains of flat cars circled round the dark green grove of Sulaco, and ran,
undulating slightly with white jets of steam, over the plain towards the
Casa Viola, on their way to the railway yards by the harbour The Italian
drivers saluted him from the footplate with raised hand, while the Negro
brakesmen sat carelessly on the brakes, looking straight forward, with
the rims of their big hats flapping in the wind. In return Giorgio would
give a slight sideways jerk of the head, without unfolding his arms.

<P>On this memorable day of the riot his arms were not folded on his chest.
His hand grasped the barrel of the gun grounded on the threshold; he did
not look up once at the white dome of Higuerota, whose cool purity seemed
to hold itself aloof from a hot earth. His eyes examined the plain curiously.
Tall trails of dust subsided here and there. In a speckless sky the sun
hung clear and blinding. Knots of men ran headlong; others made a stand;
and the irregular rattle of firearms came rippling to his ears in the fiery,
still air. Single figures on foot raced desperately. Horsemen galloped
towards each other, wheeled round together, separated at speed. Giorgio
saw one fall, rider and horse disappearing as if they had galloped into
a chasm, and the movements of the animated scene were like the passages
of a violent game played upon the plain by dwarfs mounted and on foot,
yelling with tiny throats, under the mountain that seemed a colossal embodiment
of silence. Never before had Giorgio seen this bit of plain so full of
active life; his gaze could not take in all its details at once; he shaded
his eyes with his hand, till suddenly the thundering of many hoofs near
by startled him.

<P>A troop of horses had broken out of the fenced paddock of the Railway
Company. They came on like a whirlwind, and dashed over the line snorting,
kicking, squealing in a compact, piebald, tossing mob of bay, brown, grey
backs, eyes staring, necks extended, nostrils red, long tails streaming.
As soon as they had leaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from
under their hoofs, and within six yards of Giorgio only a brown cloud with
vague forms of necks and cruppers rolled by, making the soil tremble on
its passage.

<P>Viola coughed, turning his face away from the dust, and shaking his
head slightly.

<P>`There will be some horse-catching to be done before tonight,' he muttered.

<P>In the square of sunlight falling through the door Signora Teresa, kneeling
before the chair, had bowed her head, heavy with a twisted mass of ebony
hair streaked with silver, into the palm of her hands. The black lace shawl
she used to drape about her face dropped to the ground by her side. The
two girls had got up, hand-in-hand, in short skirts, their loose hair falling
in disorder. The younger had thrown her arm across her eyes, as if afraid
to face the light. Linda, with her hand on the other's shoulder, stared
fearlessly. Viola looked at his children.

<P>The sun brought out the deep lines on his face, and, energetic in expression,
it had the immobility of a carving. It was impossible to discover what
he thought. Bushy grey eyebrows shaded his dark glance.

<P>`Well! And do you not pray like your mother?'

<P>Linda pouted, advancing her red lips, which were almost too red; but
she had admirable eyes, brown, with a sparkle of gold in the irises, full
of intelligence and meaning, and so clear that they seemed to throw a glow
upon her thin, colourless face. There were bronze glints in the sombre
clusters of her hair, and the eyelashes, long and coal black, made her
complexion appear still more pale.

<P>`Mother is going to offer up a lot of candles in the church. She always
does when Nostromo has been away fighting. I shall have some to carry up
to the Chapel of the Madonna in the Cathedral.'

<P>She said all this quickly, with great assurance, in an animated, penetrating
voice. Then, giving her sister's shoulder a slight shake, she added:

<P>`And she will be made to carry one, too!'

<P>`Why made?' inquired Giorgio, gravely. `Does she not want to?'

<P>`She is timid,' said Linda, with a little burst of laughter. `People
notice her fair hair as she goes along with us. They call out after her,
"Look at the <I>rubia</I>! Look at the <I>rubiacita</I>!" They call out
in the streets. She is timid.'

<P>`And you? You are not timid -- eh?' the father pronounced, slowly.

<P>She tossed back all her dark hair.

<P>`Nobody calls out after me.'

<P>Old Giorgio contemplated his children thoughtfully. There was two years
difference between them. They had been born to him late, years after the
boy had died. Had he lived he would have been nearly as old as Gian' Battista
-- he whom the English called Nostromo; but as to his daughters, the severity
of his temper, his advancing age, his absorption in his memories, had prevented
his taking much notice of them. He loved his children, but girls belong
more to the mother, and much of his affection had been expended in the
worship and service of liberty.

<P>When quite a youth he had deserted from a ship trading to La Plata,
to enlist in the navy of Montevideo, then under the command of Garibaldi.
Afterwards, in the Italian legion of the Republic struggling against the
encroaching tyranny of Rosas, he had taken part, on great plains, on the
banks of immense rivers, in the fiercest fighting perhaps the world had
ever known. He had lived amongst men who had declaimed about liberty, suffered
for liberty, died for liberty, with a desperate exaltation, and with their
eyes turned towards an oppressed Italy. His own enthusiasm had been fed
on scenes of carnage, on the examples of lofty devotion, on the din of
armed struggle, on the inflamed language of proclamations. He had never
parted from the chief of his choice -- the fiery apostle of independence
-- keeping by his side in America and in Italy till after the fatal day
of Aspromonte, when the treachery of kings, emperors, and ministers had
been revealed to the world in the wounding and imprisonment of his hero
-- a catastrophe that had instilled into him a gloomy doubt of ever being
able to understand the ways of divine justice.

<P>He did not deny it, however. It required patience, he would say. Though
he disliked priests, and would not put his foot inside a church for anything,
he believed in God. Were not the proclamations against tyrants addressed
to the peoples in the name of God and liberty? `God for men -- religions
for women,' he muttered sometimes. In Sicily, an Englishman who had turned
up in Palermo after its evacuation by the army of the king, had given him
a Bible in Italian -- the publication of the British and Foreign Bible
Society, bound in a dark leather cover. In periods of political adversity,
in the pauses of silence when the revolutionists issued no proclamations,
Giorgio earned his living with the first work that came to hand -- as sailor,
as dock labourer on the quays of Genoa, once as a hand on a farm in the
hills above Spezzia -- and in his spare time he studied the thick volume.
He carried it with him into battles. Now it was his only reading, and in
order not to be deprived of it (the print was small) he had consented to
accept the present of a pair of silver-mounted spectacles from Senora Emilia
Gould, the wife of the Englishman who managed the silver mine in the mountains
three leagues from the town. She was the only Englishwoman in Sulaco.

<P>Giorgio Viola had a great consideration for the English. This feeling,
born on the battlefields of Uruguay, was forty years old at the very least.
Several of them had poured their blood for the cause of freedom in America,
and the first he had ever known he remembered by the name of Samuel; he
commanded a Negro company under Garibaldi, during the famous siege of Montevideo,
and died heroically with his Negroes at the fording of the Boyana. He,
Giorgio, had reached the rank of ensign -- <I>alferez</I> -- and cooked
for the general. Later, in Italy, he, with the rank of lieutenant, rode
with the staff and still cooked for the general. He had cooked for him
in Lombardy through the whole campaign; on the march to Rome he had lassoed
his beef in the Campagna after the American manner; he had been wounded
in the defence of the Roman Republic; he was one of the four fugitives
who, with the general, carried out of the woods the inanimate body of the
general's wife into the farm-house where she died, exhausted by the hardships
of that terrible retreat. He had survived that disastrous time to attend
his general in Palermo when the Neapolitan shells from the castle crashed
upon the town. He had cooked for him on the field of Volturno after fighting
all day. And everywhere he had seen Englishmen in the front rank of the
army of freedom. He respected their nation because they loved Garibaldi.
Their very countesses and princesses had kissed the general's hands in
London, it was said. He could well believe it; for the nation was noble,
and the man was a saint. It was enough to look once at his face to see
the divine force of faith in him and his great pity for all that was poor,
suffering, and oppressed in this world.

<P>The spirit of self-forgetfulness, the simple devotion to a vast humanitarian
idea which inspired the thought and stress of that revolutionary time,
had left its mark upon Giorgio in a sort of austere contempt for all personal
advantage. This man, whom the lowest class in Sulaco suspected of having
a buried hoard in his kitchen, had all his life despised money. The leaders
of his youth had lived poor, had died poor. It had been a habit of his
mind to disregard tomorrow. It was engendered partly by an existence of
excitement, adventure, and wild warfare. But mostly it was a matter of
principle. It did not resemble the carelessness of a <I>condottiere</I>,
it was a puritanism of conduct, born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism
of religion.

<P>This stern devotion to a cause had cast a gloom upon Giorgio's old age.
It cast a gloom because the cause seemed lost. Too many kings and emperors
flourished yet in the world which God had meant for the people. He was
sad because of his simplicity. Though always ready to help his countrymen,
and greatly respected by the Italian emigrants wherever he lived (in his
exile he called it), he could not conceal from himself that they cared
nothing for the wrongs of down-trodden nations. They listened to his tales
of war readily, but seemed to ask themselves what he had got out of it
after all. There was nothing that they could see. `We wanted nothing, we
suffered for the love of all humanity!' he cried out furiously sometimes,
and the powerful voice, the blazing eyes, the shaking of the white mane,
the brown, sinewy hand pointing upwards as if to call heaven to witness,
impressed his hearers. After the old man had broken off abruptly with a
jerk of the head and a movement of the arm, meaning clearly, `But what's
the good of talking to you?' they nudged each other. There was in old Giorgio
an energy of feeling, a personal quality of conviction, something they
called `<I>terribilita</I>' -- `an old lion', they used to say of him.
Some slight incident, a chance word would set him off talking on the beach
to the Italian fishermen of Maldonado, in the little shop he kept afterwards
(in Valparaiso) to his countrymen customers; of an evening, suddenly, in
the cafe at one end of the Casa Viola (the other was reserved for the English
engineers) to the select clientele of engine-drivers and foremen of the
railway shops.

<P>With their handsome, bronzed, lean faces, shiny black ringlets, glistening
eyes, broad-chested, bearded, sometimes a tiny gold ring in the lobe of
the ear, the aristocracy of the railway works listened to him, turning
away from their cards or dominoes. Here and there a fair-haired Basque
studied his hand meantime, waiting without protest. No native of Costaguana
intruded there. This was the Italian stronghold. Even the Sulaco policemen
on a night patrol let their horses pace softly by, bending low in the saddle
to glance through the window at the heads in a fog of smoke; and the drone
of old Giorgio's declamatory narrative seemed to sink behind them into
the plain. Only now and then the assistant of the chief of police, some
broad-faced, brown little gentleman, with a great deal of Indian in him,
would put in an appearance. Leaving his man outside with the horses he
advanced with a confident, sly smile, and without a word up to the long
trestle table. He pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf; Giorgio,
thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly, served him in person. Nothing
would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs. His glass emptied, he
would take a leisurely, scrutinizing look all round the room, go out, and
ride away slowly, circling towards the town.
