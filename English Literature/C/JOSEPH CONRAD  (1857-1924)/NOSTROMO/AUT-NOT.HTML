<I>Nostromo</I> is the most anxiously meditated of the longer novels which
belong to the period following upon the publication of the <I>Typhoon</I>
volume of short stories.

<P>I don't mean to say that I became then conscious of any impending change
in my mentality and in my attitude towards the tasks of my writing life.
And perhaps there was never any change, except in that mysterious, extraneous
thing which has nothing to do with the theories of art; a subtle change
in the nature of the inspiration; a phenomenon for which I can not in any
way be held responsible. What, however, did cause me some concern was that
after finishing the last story of the <I>Typhoon</I> volume it seemed somehow
that there was nothing more in the world to write about.

<P>This so strangely negative but disturbing mood lasted some little time;
and then, as with many of my longer stories, the first hint for <I>Nostromo</I>
came to me in the shape of a vagrant anecdote completely destitute of valuable
details.

<P>As a matter of fact in 1875 or `76, when very young, in the West Indies
or rather in the Gulf of Mexico, for my contacts with land were short,
few, and fleeting, I heard the story of some man who was supposed to have
stolen single-handed a whole lighterful of silver, somewhere on the Tierra
Firme seaboard during the troubles of a revolution.

<P>On the face of it this was something of a feat. But I heard no details,
and having no particular interest in crime <I>qua</I> crime I was not likely
to keep that one in my mind. And I forgot it till twenty-six or -seven
years afterwards I came upon the very thing in a shabby volume picked up
outside a second-hand bookshop. It was the life story of an American seaman
written by himself with the assistance of a journalist. In the course of
his wanderings that American sailor worked for some months on board a schooner,
the master and owner of which was the thief of whom I had heard in my very
young days. I have no doubt of that because there could hardly have been
two exploits of that peculiar kind in the same part of the world and both
connected with a South American revolution.

<P>The fellow had actually managed to steal a lighter with silver, and
this, it seems, only because he was implicitly trusted by his employers,
who must have been singularly poor judges of character. In the sailor's
story he is represented as an unmitigated rascal, a small cheat, stupidly
ferocious, morose, of mean appearance, and altogether unworthy of the greatness
this opportunity had thrust upon him. What was interesting was that he
would boast of it openly.

<P>He used to say: `People think I make a lot of money in this schooner
of mine. But that is nothing. I don't care for that. Now and then I go
away quietly and lift a bar of silver. I must get rich slowly -- you understand.'

<P>There was also another curious point about the man. Once in the course
of some quarrel the sailor threatened him: `What's to prevent me reporting
ashore what you have told me about that silver?'

<P>The cynical ruffian was not alarmed in the least. He actually laughed.
`You fool, if you dare talk like that on shore about me you will get a
knife stuck in your back. Every man, woman, and child in that port is my
friend. And who's to prove the lighter wasn't sunk? I didn't show you where
the silver is hidden. Did I? So you know nothing. And suppose I lied? Eh?'

<P>Ultimately the sailor, disgusted with the sordid meanness of that impenitent
thief, deserted from the schooner. The whole episode takes about three
pages of his autobiography. Nothing to speak of; but as I looked them over,
the curious confirmation of the few casual words heard in my early youth
evoked the memories of that distant time when everything was so fresh,
so surprising, so venturesome, so interesting; bits of strange coasts under
the stars, shadows of hills in the sunshine, men's passions in the dusk,
gossip half-forgotten, faces grown dim. . . . Perhaps, perhaps, there still
was in the world something to write about. Yet I did not see anything at
first in the mere story. A rascal steals a large parcel of a valuable commodity
-- so people say. It's either true or untrue; and in any case it has no
value in itself. To invent a circumstantial account of the robbery did
not appeal to me, because my talents not running that way I did not think
that the game was worth the candle. It was only when it dawned upon me
that the purloiner of the treasure need not necessarily be a confirmed
rogue, that he could be even a man of character, an actor, and possibly
a victim in the changing scenes of a revolution, it was only then that
I had the first vision of a twilight country which was to become the province
of Sulaco, with its high shadowy Sierra and its misty Campo for mute witnesses
of events flowing from the passions of men short-sighted in good and evil.

<P>Such are in very truth the obscure origins of <I>Nostromo</I> -- the
book. From that moment, I suppose, it had to be. Yet even then I hesitated,
as if warned by the instinct of self-preservation from venturing on a distant
and toilsome journey into a land full of intrigues and revolutions. But
it had to be done.

<P>It took the best part of the years 1903-4 to do; with many intervals
of renewed hesitation, lest I should lose myself in the ever-enlarging
vistas opening before me as I progressed deeper in my knowledge of the
country. Often, also, when I had thought myself to a standstill over the
tangled-up affairs of the Republic, I would, figuratively speaking, pack
my bag, rush away from Sulaco for a change of air, and write a few pages
of <I>The Mirror of the Sea.</I> But generally, as I've said before, my
sojourn on the continent of Latin America, famed for its hospitality, lasted
for about two years. On my return I found (speaking somewhat in the style
of Captain Gulliver) my family all well, my wife heartily glad to learn
that the fuss was all over, and our small boy considerably grown during
my absence.

<P>My principal authority for the history of Costaguana is, of course,
my venerated friend, the late Don Jose Avellanos, Minister to the Courts
of England and Spain, etc., etc., in his impartial and eloquent <I>History
of Fifty Years of Misrule.</I> That work was never published -- the reader
will discover why -- and I am in fact the only person in the world possessed
of its contents. I have mastered them in not a few hours of earnest meditation,
I hope that my accuracy will be trusted. In justice to myself, and to allay
the fears of prospective readers, I beg to point out that the few historical
allusions are never dragged in for the sake of parading my unique erudition,
but that each of them is closely related to actuality; either throwing
a light on the nature of current events or affecting directly the fortunes
of the people of whom I speak.

<P>As to their own histories I have tried to set them down, Aristocracy
and People, men and women, Latin and Anglo-Saxon, bandit and politician,
with as cool a hand as was possible in the heat and clash of my own conflicting
emotions. And after all this is also the story of their conflicts. It is
for the reader to say how far they are deserving of interest in their actions
and in the secret purposes of their hearts revealed in the bitter necessities
of the time. I confess that, for me, that time is the time of firm friendships
and unforgotten hospitalities. And in my gratitude I must mention here
Mrs Gould, `the first lady of Sulaco', whom we may safely leave to the
secret devotion of Dr Monygham, and Charles Gould, the Idealist-creator
of Material Interests whom we must leave to his Mine--from which there
is no escape in this world.

<P>About Nostromo, the second of the two racially and socially contrasted
men, both captured by the silver of the San Tome Mine, I feel bound to
say something more.

<P>I did not hesitate to make that central figure an Italian. First of
all the thing is perfectly credible: Italians were swarming into the Occidental
Province at the time, as anybody who will read further can see; and secondly,
there was no one who could stand so well by the side of Giorgio Viola,
the Garibaldino, the Idealist of the old, humanitarian revolutions. For
myself I needed there a man of the People as free as possible from his
class-conventions and all settled modes of thinking. This is not a side-snarl
at conventions. My reasons were not moral but artistic. Had he been an
Anglo-Saxon he would have tried to get into local politics. But Nostromo
does not aspire to be a leader in a personal game. He does not want to
raise himself above the mass. He is content to feel himself a power--within
the People.

<P>But mainly Nostromo is what he is because I received the inspiration
for him in my early days from a Mediterranean sailor. Those who have read
certain pages of mine will see at once what I mean when I say that Dominic,
the <I>padrone</I> of the <I>Tremolino</I>, might under given circumstances
have been a Nostromo. At any rate Dominic would have understood the younger
man perfectly--if scornfully. He and I were engaged together in a rather
absurd adventure, but the absurdity does not matter. It is a real satisfaction
to think that in my very young days there must, after all, have been something
in me worthy to command that man's half-bitter fidelity, his half-ironic
devotion. Many of Nostromo's speeches I have heard first in Dominic's voice.
His hand on the tiller and his fearless eyes roaming the horizon from within
the monkish hood shadowing his face, he would utter the usual exordium
of his remorseless wisdom: `<I>Vous autres gentilhommes!'</I> in a caustic
tone that hangs on my ear yet. Like Nostromo! `You <I>hombres finos</I>!'
Very much like Nostromo. But Dominic the Corsican nursed a certain pride
of ancestry from which my Nostromo is free; for Nostromo's lineage had
to be more ancient still. He is a man with the weight of countless generations
behind him and no parentage to boast of. . . . Like the People.

<P>In his firm grip on the earth he inherits, in his improvidence and generosity,
in his lavishness with his gifts, in his manly vanity, in the obscure sense
of his greatness, and in his faithful devotion with something despairing
as well as desperate in its impulses, he is a Man of the People, their
very own unenvious force, disdaining to lead but ruling from within. Years
afterwards, grown older as the famous Captain Fidanza, with a stake in
the country, going about his many affairs followed by respectful glances
in the modernized streets of Sulaco, calling on the widow of the <I>cargador</I>,
attending the Lodge, listening in unmoved silence to anarchist speeches
at the meeting, the enigmatical patron of the new revolutionary agitation,
the trusted, the wealthy comrade Fidanza with the knowledge of his moral
ruin locked up in his breast, he remains essentially a man of the People.
In his mingled, love and scorn of life and in the bewildered conviction
of having been betrayed, of dying betrayed he hardly knows by what or by
whom, he is still of the People, their undoubted Great Man--with a private
history of his own.

<P>One more figure of those stirring times I would like to mention: and
that is Antonia Avellanos--the `beautiful Antonia'. Whether she is a possible
variation of Latin-American girlhood I wouldn't dare to affirm. But, for
me, she <I>is</I>. Always a little in the background by the side of her
father (my venerated friend) I hope she has yet relief enough to make intelligible
what I am going to say. Of all the people who had seen with me the birth
of the Occidental Republic, she is the only one who has kept in my memory
the aspect of continued life. Antonia the Aristocrat and Nostromo the Man
of the People are the artisans of the New Era, the true creators of the
New State; he by his legendary and daring feat, she, like a woman, simply
by the force of what she is: the only being capable of inspiring a sincere
passion in the heart of a trifler.

<P>If anything could induce me to revisit Sulaco (I should hate to see
all these changes) it would be Antonia. And the true reason for that--why
not be frank about it?--the true reason is that I have modelled her on
my first love. How we, a band of tallish schoolboys, the chums of her two
brothers, how we used to look up to that girl just out of the schoolroom
herself, as the standard-bearer of a faith to which we all were born but
which she alone knew how to hold aloft with an unflinching hope! She had
perhaps more glow and less serenity in her soul than Antonia, but she was
an uncompromising Puritan of patriotism with no taint of the slightest
worldliness in her thoughts. I was not the only one in love with her; but
it was I who had to hear oftenest her scathing criticism of my levities--very
much like poor Decoud--or stand the brunt of her austere, unanswerable
invective. She did not quite understand--but never mind. That afternoon
when I came in, a shrinking yet defiant sinner, to say the final good-bye
I received a hand-squeeze that made my heart leap and saw a tear that took
my breath away. She was softened at the last as though she had suddenly
perceived (we were such children still!) that I was really going away for
good, going very far away--even as far as Sulaco, lying unknown, hidden
from our eyes in the darkness of the Placid Gulf.

<P>That's why I long sometimes for another glimpse of the `beautiful Antonia'
(or can it be the Other?) moving in the dimness of the great cathedral,
saying a short prayer at the tomb of the first and last Cardinal-Archbishop
of Sulaco, standing absorbed in filial devotion before the monument of
Don Jose Avellanos, and, with a lingering, tender, faithful glance at the
medallion-memorial to Martin Decoud, going out serenely into the sunshine
of the Plaza with her upright carriage and her white head; a relic of the
past disregarded by men awaiting impatiently the Dawns of other New Eras,
the coming of more Revolutions.

<P>But this is the idlest of dreams; for I did understand perfectly well
at the time that the moment the breath left the body of the Magnificent
Capataz, the Man of the People, freed at last from the toils of love and
wealth, there was nothing more for me to do in Sulaco.
