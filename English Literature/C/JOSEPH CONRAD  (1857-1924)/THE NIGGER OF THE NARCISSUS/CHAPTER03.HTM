<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime the <I>Narcissus</I>, with square yards, ran out
of the fair monsoon. She drifted slowly, swinging round and round the compass,
through a few days of baffling light airs. Under the patter of short warm
showers, grumbling men whirled the heavy yards from side to sine; they
caught hold of the soaked ropes with groans and sighs, while their officers,
sulky and dripping with rain water, unceasingly ordered them about in wearied
voices. During the short respites they looked with disgust into the smarting
palms of their stiff hands, and asked one another bitterly: -- &amp;lsquo;Who
would be a sailor if he could be a farmer?&amp;rsquo; All the tempers were
spoilt, and no man cared what he said. One black night, when the watch,
panting in the heat and half-drowned with the rain, had been through four
mortal hours hunted from brace to brace, Belfast declared that he would
&amp;lsquo;chuck going to sea for ever and go in a steamer.&amp;rsquo;
This was excessive, no doubt. Captain Allistoun, with great self-control,
would mutter sadly to Mr. Baker: -- &amp;lsquo;It is not so bad -- not
so bad.&amp;rsquo; when he had managed to shove, and dodge, and manoeuvre
his smart ship through sixty miles in twenty-four hours. From the doorstep
of the little cabin, Jimmy, chin in hand, watched our distasteful labours
with insolent and melancholy eyes. We spoke to him gently -- and out of
his sight exchanged sour smiles.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, again, with a fair wind and under a clear sky, the
ship went on piling up the South Latitude. She passed outside Madagascar
and Mauritius without a glimpse ot the land. Extra lashings were put on
the spare spars. Hatches were looked to. The steward in his leisure moments
and with a worried air tried to fit washboards to the cabin doors. Stout
canvas was bent with care. Anxious eyes looked to the westward, towards
the cape of storms. The ship began to dip into a south-west swell, and
the softly luminous sky of low latitudes took on a harder sheen from day
to day above our heads: it arched high above the ship, vibrating and pale,
like an immense dome of steel, resonant with the deep voice of freshening
gales. The sunshine gleamed cold on the white curls of black waves. Before
the strong breath of westerly squalls the ship, with reduced sail, lay
slowly over, obstinate and yielding. She drove to and fro in the unceasing
endeavour to fight her way through the invisible violence of the winds:
she pitched headlong into the dark smooth hollows; she struggled upwards
over the snowy ridges of great running seas; she rolled, restless, from
side to side, like a thing in pain. Enduring and valiant, she answered
to the call of men; and her slim spars waving for ever in abrupt semicircles,
seemed to beckon in vain for help towards the stormy sky.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a bad winter off the Cape that year. The relieved
helmsmen came off flapping their arms, or ran stamping hard and blowing
into swollen, red fingers. The watch on deck dodged the sting of cold sprays
or, crouching in sheltered corners, watched dismally the high and merciless
seas boarding the ship time after time in unappeasable fury. Water tumbled
in cataracts over the forecastle doors. You had to dash through a waterfall
to get into your damp bed. The men turned in wet and turned out stiff to
face the redeeming and ruthless extractions of their glorious and obscure
fate. Far aft, and peering watchfully to windward, the officers could be
seen through the mist of squalls. They stood by the weather-rail, holding
on grimly, straight and glistening in their long coats; then, at times,
in the disordered plunges of the hard-driven ship, they appeared high up,
attentive, tossing violently above the grey line of a clouded horizon,
and in motionless attitudes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They watched the weather and the ship as men on shore watch
the momentous chances of fortune. Captain Allistoun never left the deck,
as though he had been part of the ship's fittings. Now

<P>and then the steward, shivering, but always in shirt sleeves, would
struggle towards him with some hot coffee, half of which the gale blew
out of each cup before it reached the master's lips. He drank what was
left gravely in one long gulp, while heavy sprays pattered loudly on his
oilskin coat, the seas swishing broke about his high boots; and he never
took his eyes off the ship. He watched her every motion; he kept his gaze
riveted upon here as a loving man who watches the unselfish toil of a delicate
woman upon the slender thread of whose existence is hung the whole meaning
and joy of the world. We all watched her. She was beautiful and had a weakness.
We loved her no less for that. We admired her qualities aloud, we boasted
of them to one another, as though they had been our own, and the consciousness
of her only fault we kept buried in the silence of our profound affection.
She was born in the thundering peal of hammers beating upon iron, in black
eddies of smoke, under a gray sky, on the banks of the Clyde. The clamorous
and sombre stream gives birth to things of beauty that float away into
the sunshine of the world to be loved by men. The <I>Narcissus</I> was
one of that perfect brood. Less perfect than many perhaps, but she was
ours, and consequently, incomparable. We were proud of her. In Bombay,
ignorant landlubbers alluded to her as that &amp;lsquo;pretty grey ship.&amp;rsquo;
Pretty! A scurvy meed of commendation! We knew she was the most magnificent
sea-boat ever launched. We tried to forget that, like many good sea-boats,
she was at times rather crank. She was exacting. She wanted care in loading
and handling, and no one knew exactly how much care would be enough. Such
are the imperfections of mere men! The ship knew, and sometimes would correct
the presumptuous human ignorance by the wholesome discipline of fear. We
had heard ominous stories about past voyages. The cook (technically a seaman,
but in reality no sailor) -- the cook, when unstrung by some misfortune,
such as the rolling over of a saucepan, would mutter gloomily while he
wiped the floor: -- &amp;lsquo;There! Look at what she has done! Some voy'ge
she will drown all hands! You'll see if she won't.&amp;rsquo; To which
the steward, snatching in the galley a moment to draw breath in the hurry
of his worried life, would remark philosophically: -- &amp;lsquo;Those
that see won't tell, anyhow. I don't want to see it.&amp;rsquo; We derided
those fears. Our hearts went out to the old man when he pressed her hard
so

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 38</TT>

<P>as to make her hold her own, hold to every inch gained to windward;
when he made her under reefed sails, leap obliquely at enormous waves.
The men, knitted together aft into a ready group by the first sharp order
of an officer coming to take charge of the deck in bad weather: -- &amp;lsquo;Keep
handy the watch,&amp;rsquo; stood admiring her valiance. Their eyes blinked
in the wind; their dark faces were wet with drops of water more salt and
bitter than human tears; beards and moustaches, soaked, hung straight and
dripping like fine seaweed. They were fantastically misshapen; in high
boots, in hats like helmets, and swaying clumsily, stiff and bulky in glistening
oilskins, they resembled men strangely equipped for some fabulous adventure.
Whenever she rose easily to a towering green sea, elbows dug ribs, faces
brightened, lips murmured: -- &amp;lsquo;Didn't she do it cleverly,&amp;rsquo;
and all the heads turning like one watched with sardonic grins the foiled
wave go roaring to leeward, white with the foam of a monstrous rage. But
when she had not been quick enough and, stuck heavily, lay over trembling
under the blow, we clutched at the ropes, and looking up at the narrow
bands of drenched and strained sails waving desperately aloft, we thought
in our hearts -- &amp;lsquo;No wonder. Poor thing!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The thirty-second day out of Bombay began inauspiciously.
In the morning a sea smashed one of the galley doors. We dashed in through
lots of steam and found the cook very wet and indignant with the ship:
-- &amp;lsquo;She's getting worse every day. She's trying to drown me in
front of my own stove!&amp;rsquo; He was very angry. We pacified him, and
the carpenter, though washed away twice from there, managed to repair the
door. Through that accident our dinner was not ready till late, but it
didn't matter in the end because Knowles, who went to fetch it, got knocked
down by a sea and the dinner went over the side. Captain Allistoun, looking
more hard and thin-lipped than ever, hung on to full topsails and foresail,
and would not notice that the ship, asked to do too much, appeared to lose
heart altogether for the first time since we knew her. She refused to rise,
and bored her way sullenly through the seas. Twice running, as though she
had been blind or weary of life, she put her nose deliberately into a big
wave and swept the decks from end to end. As the boatswain observed with
marked annoyance, while we were splashing about in a body to try and save
a worthless

<P>wash-tub: -- &amp;lsquo;Every blooming thing in the ship is going overboard
this afternoon.&amp;rsquo; Venerable Singleton broke his habitual silence
and said with a glance aloft: -- &amp;lsquo;The old man's in a temper with
the weather, but it's no good bein' angry with the winds of heaven.&amp;rsquo;
Jimmy had shut his door, of course. We knew he was dry and comfortable
within his little cabin, and in our absurd say were pleased one moment,
exasperated the next, by that certitude. Donkin skulked shamelessly, uneasy
and miserable. He grumbled: -- &amp;lsquo;I'm perishin' with cold houtside
in bloomin' wet rags, an' that 'ere black sojer sits dry on a blamed chest
full of bloomin' clothes; blank his black soul!&amp;rsquo; We took no notice
of him; we hardly gave a thought to Jimmy and his bosom friend. There was
no leisure for idle probing of hearts. Sails blew adrift. Things broke
loose. Cold and wet, we were washed about the deck while trying to repair
damages. The ship tossed about, shaken furiously, like a toy in the hand
of a lunatic. Just at sunset there was a rush to shorten sail before the
menace of a sombre hail cloud. The hard gust of wind came brutal like the
blow of a fist. The ship relieved of her canvas in time received it pluckily:
she yielded reluctantly to the violent onset; then, coming up with a stately
and irresistible motion, brought her spars to windward in the teeth of
the screeching squall. Out of the abysmal darkness of the black cloud overhead
white hail streamed on her, rattled on the rigging, leaped in handfuls
off the yards, rebounded on the deck -- round and gleaming in the murky
turmoil like a shower of pearls. It passed away. For a moment a livid sun
shot horizontally the last rays of a sinister light between the hills of
steep, rolling waves. Then a wild night rushed in -- stamped out in a great
howl that dismal remnant of a stormy day.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no sleep on board that night. Most seamen remember
in their life one or two such nights of a culminating gale. Nothing seems
left of the whole universe but darkness, clamour, fury -- and the ship.
And like the last vestige of a shattered creation she drifts, bearing an
anguished remnant of sinful mankind, through the distress, tumult, and
pain of an avenging terror. No one slept in the forecastle. The tin oil-lamp
suspended on a long string, smoking, described wide circles; wet clothing
made dark heaps on the glistening floor; a thin layer of water rushed to
and fro. In the

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 40</TT>

<P>bed-places men lay booted, resting on elbows and with open eyes. Hung-up
suits of oilskin swung out and in, lively and disquieting like reckless
ghosts of decapitated seamen dancing in a tempest. No one spoke and all
listened. Outside the night moaned and sobbed to the accompaniment of a
continuous loud tremor as of innumerable drums beating far off. Shrieks
passed through the air. Tremendous dull blows made the ship tremble while
she rolled under the weight of the seas toppling on her deck. At times
she soared up swiftly as if to leave this earth for ever, than during interminable
moments fell through a void with all the hearts on board of her standing
still, till a frightful shock, expected and sudden, started them off again
with a big thump. After every dislocating jerk of the ship, Wamibo, stretched
full length, his face on the pillow, groaned slightly with the pain of
his tormented universe. Now and then, for the fraction of an intolerable
second, the ship, in the fiercer burst of a terrible uproar, remained on
her side, vibrating and still, with a stillness more appalling than the
wildest motion. Then upon all those prone bodies a stir would pass, a shiver
of suspense. A man would protrude his anxious head and a pair of eyes glistened
in the sway of light, glaring wildly. Some moved their legs a little as
if making ready to jump out. But several, motionless on their backs and
with one hand gripping hard the edge of the bunk, smoked nervously with
quick puffs, staring upwards; immobilised in a great craving for peace.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At midnight, orders were given to furl the fore and mizen
topsails. With immense efforts men crawled aloft through a merciless buffeting,
saved the canvas, and crawled down almost exhausted, to bear in panting
silence the cruel battering of the seas. Perhaps for the first time in
the history of the merchant service the watch, told to go below, did not
leave the deck, as if compelled to remain there by the fascination of a
venomous violence. At every heavy gust men, huddled together, whispered
to one another: -- &amp;lsquo;It can blow no harder&amp;rsquo; -- and presently
the gale would give them the lie with a piercing shriek, and drive their
breath back into their throats. A fierce squall seemed to burst asunder
the thick mass of sooty vapours; and above the wrack of torn clouds glimpses
could be caught of the high moon rushing backwards with frightful speed
over the sky, right into the wind's eye. Many hung their

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 41</TT>

<P>heads, muttering that it &amp;lsquo;turned their inwards out&amp;rsquo;
to look at it. Soon the clouds closed up, and the world again became a
raging, blind darkness that howled, flinging at the lonely ship salt sprays
and sleet.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About half-past seven the pitchy obscurity round us turned
a ghastly grey, and we knew that the sun had risen. This unnatural and
threatening daylight, in which we could see one another's wild eyes and
drawn faces, was only an added tax on our endurance. The horizon seemed
to have come on all sides within arm's length of the s hip. Into that narrowed
circle furious seas leaped in, stuck, and leaped out. A rain of salt, heavy
drops flew aslant like mist. The main-topsail had to be goose-winged, and
with stolid resignation every one prepared to go aloft once more; but the
officers yelled, pushed back, and at last we understood that no more men
would be allowed to go on the yard than were absolutely necessary for the
work. As at any moment the masts were likely to be jumped out or blown
overboard, we concluded that the captain didn't want to see all his crowd
go over the side at once. That was reasonable. The watch then on duty,
led by Mr. Creighton, began to struggle up the rigging. The wind flattened
them against the ratlines; then, easing a little, would let them ascent
a couple of steps; and again, with a sudden gust, pin all up the shrouds
the whole drawling line in attitudes of crucifixion. The other watch plunged
down on the main deck to haul up the sail. Men's heads bobbed up as the
water flung them irresistibly from side to side. Mr. Baker grunted encouragingly
in our midst, spluttering and blowing amongst the tangled ropes like an
energetic porpoise. Favoured by an ominous and untrustworthy lull, the
work was done without any one being lost either off the deck or from the
yard. For the moment the gale seemed to take off, and the ship, as if grateful
for our efforts, plucked up heart and made better weather of it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At eight the men off duty, watching their chance, ran forward
over the flooded deck to get some rest. The other half of the crew remained
aft for their turn of &amp;lsquo;seeing her through her trouble,&amp;rsquo;
as they expressed if. The two mates urged the master to go below. Mr. Baker
grunted in his ear: -- &amp;lsquo;Ough! surely now....Ough!....confidence
in us....nothing more to do....she must lay it out or go. Ough! Ough!&amp;rsquo;
Tall young Mr. Creighton smiled down at him cheerfully: -- &amp;lsquo;....She's
right as a trivet! Take a spell, sir.&amp;rsquo; He looked at them stonily
with bloodshot, sleepless eyes. The rims of his eyelids were scarlet, and
he moved his jaw unceasingly with a slow effort, as though he had been
masticating a lump of india-rubber. He shook his head. He repeated: --
&amp;lsquo;Never mind me. I must see it out -- I must see it out,&amp;rsquo;
but he consented to sit down for a moment on the skylight, with his hard
face turned unflinchingly to windward. The sea spat at it -- and stoical,
it streamed with water as though he had been weeping. On the weather side
of the poop the watch, hanging on to the mizen rigging and to one another,
tried to exchange encouraging words. Singleton, at the wheel, yelled out:
-- &amp;lsquo;Look out for yourselves!&amp;rsquo; His voice reached them
in a warning whisper. They were startled.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A big, foaming sea came out of the mist; it made for the
ship, roaring wildly, and in its rush it looked as mischievous and discomposing
as a madman with an axe. One or two, shouting, scrambled up the rigging;
most, with a convulsive catch of the breath, held on where they stood.
Singleton dug his knees under the wheel-box, and carefully eased the helm
to the headlong pitch of the ship, but without taking his eyes off the
coming wave. It towered close-to and high, like a wall of green glass topped
with snow. The ship rose to it as though she had soared on wings, and for
a moment rested poised upon the foaming crest, as if she had been a great
sea-bird. Before we could draw breath a heavy gust struck her, another
roller took her unfairly under the weather bow, she gave a toppling lurch,
and filled her decks. Captain Allistoun leaped up, and fell; Archie rolled
over him, screaming: -- &amp;lsquo;She will rise!&amp;rsquo; She gave another
lurch to leeward; the lower deadeyes dipped heavily; the men's feet flew
from under them, and they hung kicking above the slanting poop. They could
see the ship putting her side in the water, and shouted all together: --
&amp;lsquo;She's going!&amp;rsquo; Forward the forecastle doors flew open,
and the watch below were seen leaping out one after another, throwing their
arms up; and, falling on hands and knees, scrambled aft on all fours along
the high side of the deck, sloping more than the roof of a house. From
leeward the seas rose, pursuing them; they looked wretched in a hopeless
struggle, like vermin fleeing before a flood;

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 43</TT>

<P>they fought up the weather ladder of the poop one after another, half
naked and staring wildly; and as soon as they got up they shot to leeward
in clusters, with closed eyes, till they brought up heavily with their
ribs against the iron stanchions of the rail; then, groaning, they rolled
in a confused mass. The immense volume of water thrown forward by the last
scend of the ship had burst the lee door of the forecastle. They could
see their chests, pillows, blankets, clothing, come out floating upon the
sea. While they struggled back to windward they looked in dismay. The straw
beds swam high, the blankets, spread out, undulated; while the chests,
waterlogged and with a heavy list, pitched heavily, like dismasted hulks,
before they sank; Archie's big coat passed with outspread arms, resembling
a drowned seaman floating with his head under water. Men were slipping
down while trying to dig their fingers into the planks; others, jammed
in corners, rolled enormous eyes. They all yelled unceasingly; -- &amp;lsquo;The
masts! Cut! Cut!....&amp;rsquo; A black squall howled over the ship, that
lay on her side with the weather yard-arms pointing to the clouds; while
the tall masts, inclined nearly to the horizon, seemed to be of an unmeasurable
length. The carpenter let go his hold, rolled against the skylight, and
began to crawl to the cabin entrance, where a big axe was kept ready for
just such an emergency. At that moment the topsail sheet parted, the end
of the heavy chain racketed aloft, and sparks of red fire streamed down
through the flying sprays. The sail flapped once with a jerk that seemed
to tear our hearts out through our teeth, and instantly changed into a
bunch of fluttering narrow ribbons that tied themselves into knots and
became quiet along the yard. Captain Allistoun struggled, managed to stand
up with his face near the deck, upon which men swung on the ends of ropes,
like nest robbers upon a cliff. One of his feet was on somebody's chest;
his face was purple; his lips moved. He yelled also; he yelled, bending
down: -- &amp;lsquo;No! No!&amp;rsquo; Mr. Baker, one leg over the binnacle-stand,
roared out: -- &amp;lsquo;Did you say no? Not cut?&amp;rsquo; He shook
his head madly. &amp;lsquo;No! No!&amp;rsquo; Between his legs the crawling
carpenter heard, collapsed at once, and lay full length in the angle of
the skylight. Voices took up the shout -- &amp;lsquo;No! No!&amp;rsquo;
Then all became still. They waited for the ship to turn over altogether,
and shake them out into the sea; and upon the terrific noise of wind and
sea not a

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 44</TT>

<P>murmur of remonstrance came out from those men, who each would have
given ever so many years of life to see &amp;lsquo;them damned sticks go
overboard!&amp;rsquo; They all believed it their only chance, but a little
hard-faced man shook his grey head and shouted &amp;lsquo;No!&amp;rsquo;
without giving them as much as a glance. They were silent, and gasped.
They gripped rails, they had wound ropes'-ends under their arms; they clutched
ring-bolts, they crawled in heaps where there was foothold; they held on
with both arms, hooked themselves to any thing to windward with elbows,
with chins, almost with their teeth: and some, unable to crawl away from
where they had been flung, felt the sea leap up striking against their
backs as they struggled upwards. Singleton had stuck to the wheel. His
hair flew out in the wind; the gale seemed to take its life-long adversary
by the beard and shake his old head. He wouldn't let go, and, with his
knees forced between the spokes, flew up and down like a man on a bough.
As Death appeared unready, they began to look about. Donkin, caught by
one foot in a loop of some rope, hung, head down, below us and yelled,
with his face to the deck: -- &amp;lsquo;Cut! Don't mind that murderin'
fool! Cut, some of you!&amp;rsquo; One of his rescuers struck him a back-handed
blow over the mouth; his head banged on the deck and he became suddenly
very quiet, with a white face, breathing hard, and with a few drops of
blood trickling from his cut lip. On the lee side another man could be
seen stretched out as if stunned; only the washboard prevented him from
going over the side. It was the steward. We had to sling him up like a
bale, for he was paralysed with fright. he had rushed up out of the pantry
when he felt the ship go over, and had rolled down helplessly, clutching
a china mug. It was not broken. With difficulty we tore it from him, and
when he saw it in our hands he was amazed. &amp;lsquo;Where did you get
that thing?&amp;rsquo; he kept on asking, in a trembling voice. His shirt
was blown to shreds; the ripped sleeves flapped like wings. Two men made
him fast, and, doubled over the rope that held him, he resembled a bundle
of wet rags. Mr. Baker crawled along the line of men, asking: -- &amp;lsquo;Are
you all there?&amp;rsquo; and looking

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 45</TT>

<P>them over. Some blinked vacantly, others shook convulsively; Wamibo's
head hung over his breast; and in painful attitudes, cut by lashings, exhausted
with clutching, screwed up in corners, they breathed heavily. Their lips
twitched, and at every sickening heave of the overturned ship they opened
them wide as if to shout. The cook, embracing a wooden stanchion, unconsciously
repeated a prayer. In every short interval of the fiendish noises around
he could be heard there without cap or slippers, imploring in that storm
the Master of our lives not to lead him into temptation. Soon he also became
silent. In all that crowd of cold and hungry men, waiting wearily for a
violent death, not a voice was heard; they were mute, and in sombre thoughtfulness
listened to the horrible imprecations of the gale.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hours passed. They were sheltered by the heavy inclination
of the ship from the wind that rushed in one long unbroken moan above their
heads, but cold rain showers fell at times into the uneasy calm of their
refuge. Under the torment of that new infliction a pair of shoulders would
writhe a little. Teeth chattered. The sky was clearing, and bright sunshine
gleamed over the ship. After every burst of battering seas, vivid and fleeting
rainbows arched over the drifting hull in the flick of sprays. the gale
was ending in a clear blow, which gleamed and cut like a knife. Between
two bearded shellbacks Charley, fastened with somebody's long muffler to
a deck ring-bolt, wept quietly, with rare tears wrung out by bewilderment,
cold, hunger, and general misery. One of his neighbours punched him in
the ribs, asking roughly : -- &amp;lsquo;What's the matter with your cheek?
In fine weather there's no holding you, youngster.&amp;rsquo; Turning about
with prudence he worked himself out of his coat and threw it over the boy.
The other man closed up, muttering: -- &amp;lsquo;Twill make a bloomin'
man of you, sonny.&amp;rsquo; They flung their arms over and pressed against
him. Charley drew his feet up and his eyelids dropped. Sighs were heard,
as men, perceiving that they were not to be &amp;lsquo;drowned in a hurry,&amp;rsquo;
tried easier positions. Mr. Creighton, who had hurt his leg, lay amongst
us with compressed lips. Some fellows belonging to his watch set about
securing him better. Without a word or a glance he lifted his arms one
after the other to facilitate the operation, and not a muscle moved in
his stern, young face. They asked him with solicitude: --

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 46</TT>

<P>&amp;lsquo;Easier now, sir?&amp;rsquo; He answered with a curt: -- &amp;lsquo;That'll
do.&amp;rsquo; He was a hard young officer, but many of his watch used
to say they liked him well enough because he had &amp;lsquo;such a gentlemanly
way of damning us up and down the deck.&amp;rsquo; Others, unable to discern
such fine shades of refinement, respected him for his smartness. For the
first time since the ship had gone on her beam ends Captain Allistoun gave
a short glance down at his men. He was almost upright -- one foot against
the side of the skylight, one knee on the deck; and with the end of the
vang round his waist swung back and forth with his gaze fixed ahead watchful,
like a man looking out for a sign. Before his eyes the ship, with half
her deck below water, rose and fell on heavy seas that rushed from under
her flashing in the cold sunshine. We began to think she was wonderfully
buoyant -- considering. confident voices were heard shouting: -- &amp;lsquo;She'll
do, boys!&amp;rsquo; Belfast exclaimed with fervour: -- &amp;lsquo;I would
give a month's pay for a draw at a pipe!&amp;rsquo; One or two, passing
dry tongues on their salt lips, muttered something about a &amp;lsquo;drink
of waterl.&amp;rsquo; The cook, as if inspired, scrambled up with his breast
against the poop water-cask and looked in. There was a little at the bottom.
He yelled, waved his arms, and two men began to crawl backwards and forwards
with the mug. We had a good mouthful all round. The master shook his head
impatiently, refusing. When it came to Charley one of his neighbours shouted:
-- &amp;lsquo;That bloomin' boy's asleep.&amp;rsquo; He slept as though
he had been dosed with narcotics. They let him be. Singleton held to the
wheel with one hand while he drank, bending down to shelter his lips from
the wind. Wamibo had to be poked and yelled at before he saw the mug held
before his eyes . Knowles said sagaciously: -- &amp;lsquo;It's better'n
a tot o' rum.&amp;rsquo; Mr. Baker grunted: -- &amp;lsquo;Thank ye.&amp;rsquo;
Mr. Creighton drank and nodded. Donkin gulped greedily, glaring over the
rim. Belfast made us laugh when with grimacing mouth he shouted: -- &amp;lsquo;Pass
it this way. We're all taytottlers here.&amp;rsquo; The master, presented
with the mug again by a crouching man, who screamed up at him: -- &amp;lsquo;We
all had a drink, captain,&amp;rsquo; groped for it without ceasing to look
ahead, and handed it back stiffly as though he could not spare half a glance
away from the ship. Faces brightened. We shouted to the cook: -- &amp;lsquo;Well
done, doctor!&amp;rsquo; He sat to leeward, propped by the water-cask and
yelled back abundantly, but the seas were breaking in thunder

<P>

<P><TT>Page 47</TT>

<P>just then, and we only caught snatches that sounded like: &amp;lsquo;Providence&amp;rsquo;
and &amp;lsquo;born again.&amp;rsquo; He was at his old game of preaching.
We made friendly but derisive gestures at him, and from below he lifted
one arm, holding on with the other, moved his lips, he beamed up to us,
straining his voice -- earnest, and ducking his head before the sprays.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly some one cried: -- &amp;lsquo;Where's Jimmy?&amp;rsquo;
and we were appalled once more. On the end of the row the boatswain shouted
hoarsely: -- &amp;lsquo;Has anyone seed him come out?&amp;rsquo; Voices
exclaimed dismally: -- &amp;lsquo;Drowned -- is he?.... No! In his cabin!....Good
Lord!....Caught like a bloomin' rat in a trap.....Couldn't open his door....
....Aye! She went over too quick and the water jammed it....Poor beggar!....No
help for 'im.....Let's go and see....&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Damn him, who
could go?&amp;rsquo; screamed Donkin. -- &amp;lsquo;Nobody expects you
to,&amp;rsquo; growled the man next to him; &amp;lsquo;you're only a thing.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Is there half a chance to get at 'im?&amp;rsquo; inquired
two or three men together. Belfast untied himself with blind impetuosity,
and all at once shot down to leeward quicker than a flash of lightning.
We shouted all together with dismay; but with his legs overboard he held
and yelled for a rope. In our extremity nothing could be terrible; so we
judged him funny kicking there, and with his scared face. some one began
to laugh, and, as if hysterically infected with screaming merriment, all
those haggard men went off laughing, wild-eyed, like a lot of maniacs tied
up on a wall. Mr. Baker swung off the binnacle-stand and tendered him one
leg. He scrambled up rather scared, and consigning us with abominable words
to the &amp;lsquo;divvle.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;You are....Ough! You're
a foul-mouthed beggar, Craik,&amp;rsquo; grunted Mr. Baker. He answered,
stuttering with indignation: -- &amp;lsquo;Look at 'em, sorr. The bloomin'
dirty images! laughing at a chum gone overboard. Call themselves men, too.&amp;rsquo;
But from the poop the boatswain called out: -- &amp;lsquo;Come along.&amp;rsquo;
and Belfast crawled away in a hurry to join him. the five men, poised and
gazing over the edge of the poop, looked for the best way to get forward.
They seemed to hesitate. The others, twisting in their lashings, turning
painfully, stared with open lips. Captain Allistoun saw nothing; he seemed
with his eyes to hold the ship up in a superhuman concentration of effort.
The wind screamed loud in the sunshine; columns of spray rose straight
up; and in the glitter of

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 48</TT>

<P>rainbows bursting over the trembling hull the men went cautiously, disappearing
from sight with deliberate movements.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They went swinging from belaying-pin to cleat above the
seas that beat the half-submerged deck. Their toes scraped the the planks.
Lumps of cold green water toppled over the bulwark and on their heads.
They hung for a moment on strained arms, with the breath knocked out of
them, and with closed eyes -- then, letting go with one hand, balanced
with lolling heads, trying to grab some rope or stanchion further forward.
The long-armed and athletic boatswain swung quickly, gripping things with
a fist hard as iron, and remembering suddenly snatches of the last letter
from his &amp;lsquo;old woman.&amp;rsquo; Little Belfast scrambled rageously,
muttering &amp;lsquo;cursed nigger.&amp;rsquo; Wamibo's tongue hung out
with excitement; and Archie, intrepid and calm, watched his chance to move
with intelligent coolness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When above the side of the house, they let go one after
another, and falling heavily , sprawled, pressing their palms to the smooth
teak wood. Round them the backwash of waves seethed white and hissing.
All the doors had become trap-doors, of course. The first was the galley
door. The galley extended from side to side, and they could hear the sea
splashing with hollow noises in there. The next door was that of the carpenter's
shop. They lifted it, and looked down. The room seemed to have been devastated
by an earthquake. Everything in it had tumbled on the bulkhead facing the
door, and on the other side of that bulkhead there was Jimmy, dead or alive.
The bench, a half-finished meat-safe, saws, chisels, wire rods, axes, crowbars,
lay in a heap besprinkled with loose nails. A sharp adze stuck up with
a shining edge that gleamed dangerously down there like a wicked smile.
The men clung to one another peering. A sickening, sly lurch of the ship
nearly sent them overboard in a body. Belfast howled &amp;lsquo;Here goes!&amp;rsquo;
and leaped down. Archie followed cannily, catching at shelves that gave
way with him, and eased himself in a great crash of ripped wood. There
was hardly room for three men to move. And in the sunshiny blue square
of the door, the boatswain's face, bearded and dark, Wamibo's face, wild
and pale, hung over -- watching.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Together they shouted: &amp;lsquo;Jimmy! Jim!&amp;rsquo;
From above the boatswain contributed a deep growl: &amp;lsquo;You....Wait!&amp;rsquo;
In a pause, Belfast

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 49</TT>

<P>entreated: &amp;lsquo;Jimmy, darlin' are ye aloive?&amp;rsquo; The boatswain
said: &amp;lsquo;Again! All together boys!&amp;rsquo; All yelled excitedly.
Wamibo made noises resembling loud barks. Belfast drummed on the side of
the bulkhead with a piece of iron. All ceased suddenly. The sound of screaming
and hammering went on thin and distinct -- like a solo after a chorus.
He was alive. He was screaming and knocking below us with the hurry of
a man prematurely shut up in a coffin. We went to work. We attacked with
desperation the abominable heap of things heavy, of things sharp, of things
clumsy to handle. The boatswain crawled away to find somewhere a flying
end of a rope; and Wamibo, held back by shouts: -- &amp;lsquo;Don't jump!....
Don't come in here, muddle-head!&amp;rsquo; -- remained glaring above us
-- all shining eyes, gleaming fangs, tumbled hair; resembling an amazed
and half-witted fiend gloating over the extraordinary agitation of the
damned. The boatswain adjured us to &amp;lsquo;bear a hand,&amp;rsquo;
and a rope descended. We made things fast to it and they went up spinning,
never to be seen by man again. A rage to fling things overboard possessed
us. We worked fiercely, cutting our hands, and speaking brutally to one
another. Jimmy kept up a distracting row; he screamed piercingly, without
drawing breath, like a tortured woman; he banged with hands and feet. The
agony of his fear wrung our hearts so terribly that we longed to abandon
him, to get out of that place deep as a well and swaying like a tree, to
get out of his hearing, back on the poop where we could wait passively
for death in incomparable repose. We shouted to him to &amp;lsquo;shut
up, for God's sake.&amp;rsquo; He redoubled his cries. He must have fancied
we could not hear him. Probably he heard his own clamour but faintly. We
could picture him crouching on the edge of the upper berth, letting out
with both fists at the wood, in the dark, and with his mouth wide open
for that unceasing cry. Those were loathsome moments. A cloud driving across
the sun would darken the doorway menacingly. Every movement of the ship
was pain. We scrambled about with no room to breathe, and felt frightfully
sick. The boatswain yelled down at us: -- &amp;lsquo;Bear a hand! Bear
a hand! We two will be washed away from here directly if you ain't quick!&amp;rsquo;
Three times a sea leaped over the high side and flung bucketfuls of water
on our heads. Then Jimmy, startled by the shock, would stop his noise for
a moment -- waiting for the ship to sink,

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 50</TT>

<P>perhaps -- and began again, distressingly loud, as if invigorated by
the gust of fear. At the bottom the nails lay in a layer several inches
thick. It was ghastly. Every nail in the world, not driven in firmly somewhere,
seemed to have found its way into that carpenter's shop. There they were,
of all kinds, the remnants of stores from seven voyages. Tin-tacks, copper
tacks (sharp as needles), pump nails, with big heads, like tiny iron mushrooms;
nails without any heads (horrible); French nails polished and slim. They
lay in a solid mass more inabordable than a hedgehog. We hesitated yearning
for a shovel, while Jimmy below us yelled as though he had been flayed.
Groaning, we dug our fingers in, and very much hurt, shook our hands, scattering
nails and drops of blood. We passed up our hats full of assorted nails
to the boatswain, who, as if performing a mysterious and appeasing rite,
cast them wide upon a raging sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We got to the bulkhead at last. Those were stout planks.
She was a ship, well finished in every detail -- the <I>Narcissus</I> was.
They were the stoutest planks ever put into a ship's bulkhead -- we thought
-- and then we perceived that, in our hurry, we had sent all the tools
overboard. Absurd little Belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight,
and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok, cursing the Clyde
shipwrights for not scamping their work. Incidentally he reviled all North
Britain, the rest of the earth, the sea -- and all his companions. He swore,
as he alighted heavily on his heels, that he would never, never any more
associate with any fool that &amp;lsquo;hadn't savee enough to know his
knee from him elbow.&amp;rsquo; He managed by his thumping to scare the
last remnant of wits out of Jimmy. We could hear the object of our exasperated
solicitude darting to and fro under the planks, now here, now there, in
a puzzling manner. He squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows. It was
more heartrending even than his yells. Suddenly Archie produced a crowbar.
He had kept it back; also a small hatchet. We howled with satisfaction.
He struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes. The boatswain
above shouted: -- &amp;lsquo;Look out! Look out there. Don't kill the man.
Easy does it!&amp;rsquo; Wamibo, maddened with the excitement hung head
down and insanely urged us: -- &amp;lsquo;Hoo! Strook

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 51</TT>

<P>'im! Hoo! Hoo!&amp;rsquo; We were afraid he would fall in and kill one
of us and, hurriedly, we entreated the boatswain to &amp;lsquo;shove the
blamed Finn overboard.&amp;rsquo; Then, all together, we yelled down at
the planks: -- &amp;lsquo;Stand from under! Get forward.&amp;rsquo; and
listened. We only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us, the
mingled roar and hiss of the seas. The ship, as if overcome with despair,
wallowed lifelessly, and our heads swam with that unnatural motion. Belfast
clamoured: -- &amp;lsquo;For the love of God, Jimmy, where are ye?....Knock!
Jimmy darlint!....Knock! You bloody black beast! Knock!&amp;rsquo; He was
as quiet as a dead man inside a grave; and, like men standing above a grave,
we were on the verge of tears -- but with vexation, the strain, the fatigue;
with the great longing to be done with it, to get away, and lay down to
rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe, Archie shouted:
-- &amp;lsquo;Gi'e me room!&amp;rsquo; We crouched behind him, guarding
our heads, and he struck time after time in the joint of the planks. They
cracked. Suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered oblong
hole. It must have missed Jimmy's head by less than an inch. Archie withdrew
it quickly, and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole, put his lips to
it, and whispered &amp;lsquo;Help&amp;rsquo; in an almost extinct voice;
he pressed his head to it, trying madly to get out through that opening
one inch wide and three inches long. In our disturbed state we were absolutely
paralysed by his incredible action. It seemed impossible to drive him away.
Even Archie at last lost his composure. &amp;lsquo;If ye don't clear oot
I'll drive the crowbar thro' your head.&amp;rsquo; he shouted in a determined
voice. He meant what he said, and his earnestness seemed to make an impression
on Jimmy. He disappeared suddenly, and we set to prising and tearing at
the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy, and
spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb. The wood split, cracked,
gave way. Belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously. &amp;lsquo;I've
got 'im! Got 'im,&amp;rsquo; he shouted. &amp;lsquo;Oh! There!....He's
gone; ;I've got 'im!....Pull at my legs!....Pull!&amp;rsquo; Wamibo hooted
unceasingly. The boatswain shouted directions: -- &amp;lsquo;Catch hold
of his hair, Belfast; pull straight up, you two!.... Pull fair!&amp;rsquo;
We pulled fair. We pulled Belfast out with a jerk, and dropped him with
disgust. In a sitting posture, purple-faced, he sobbed despairingly: --
&amp;lsquo;How can I hold on to 'is blooming short wool?&amp;rsquo;

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 52</TT>

<P>Suddenly Jimmy's head and shoulders appeared. He stuck half-way, and
with rolling eyes foamed at our feet. We flew at him with brutal impatience,
we tore the shirt off his back, we tugged at his ears, we panted over him;
and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go
his legs. With the same movement, without a pause, we swung him up. His
breath whistled, he kicked our upturned faces, he grasped two pairs of
arms above his head, and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he
seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas.
Streaming with perspiration, we swarmed up the rope, and, coming into the
blast of cold wind, gasped like men plunged into icy water. With burning
faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones. Never before had the
gale seemed to us more furious, the sea more mad, the sunshine more merciless
and mocking, and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling.
Every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning
of ours. We staggered away from the door, and, alarmed by a sudden roll,
fell down in a bunch. it appeared to us that the side of the house was
more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice. There was nothing to
hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door.
Wamibo held on to it and we held on to Wamibo, clutching our Jimmy. He
had completely collapsed now. He did not seem to have the strength to close
his hand. We stuck to him blindly in our fear. We were not afraid of Wamibo
letting go (we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men
in the ship), but we were afraid of the hook giving way, and we also believed
that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last. But she didn't.
A sea swept over us. The boatswain spluttered: -- &amp;lsquo;Up and away.
There's a lull. Away aft with you, or we will all go to the devil here.&amp;rsquo;
We stood up surrounding Jimmy. We begged him to h old up, to hold on, at
least. He glared with his bulging eyes, mute as a fish, and with all the
stiffness knocked out of him. He wouldn't stand; he wouldn't even as much
as clutch at our necks; he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with
soft cotton wool; his arms and legs swung jointless and pliable; his head
rolled about; the lower lip hung down, enormous and heavy. We pressed round
him, bothered

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 53</TT>

<P>and dismayed; sheltering him we swung here and there in a body; and
on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing
and absurd gestures, like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen
corpse.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something had to be done. We had to get him aft. A rope
was tied slack under his armpits, and, reaching up at the risk of our lives,
we hung him on the foresheet cleet. He emitted no sound; he looked as ridiculously
lamentable as a doll that had lost half its sawdust, and we started on
our perilous journey over the main deck, dragging along with care that
pitiful, that limp, that hateful burden. He was not very heavy, but had
he weighed a ton he could not have been more awkward to handle. We literally
passed him from hand to hand. Now and then we had to hang him up on a handy
belaying-pin, to draw a breath and reform the line. Had the pin broken
he would have irretrievably gone into the Southern Ocean, but he had to
take his chance of that; and after a little while, becoming apparently
aware of it, he groaned slightly, and with a great effort whispered a few
words. We listened eagerly. He was reproaching us with our carelessness
in letting him run such risks: &amp;lsquo;Now, after I got myself from
there,&amp;rsquo; he breathed out weakly. &amp;lsquo;There&amp;rsquo; was
his cabin. And he got himself out. We had nothing to do with it apparently!....No
matter.....We went on and let him take his chances, simply because we could
not help it; for though at that time we hated him more than ever -- more
than anything under heaven -- we did not want to lose him. We had so far
saved him; and it had become a personal matter between us and the sea.
We meant to stick to him. Had we (by an incredible hypothesis) undergone
similar toil and trouble for an empty cask, that cask would have become
as precious to us as Jimmy was. More precious, in fact, because we would
have had no reason to hate the cask. And we hated James Wait. We could
not get rid of the monstrous suspicion that this astounding black-man was
shamming sick, had been malingering heartlessly in the face of our toil,
of our scorn, of our patience -- and now was malingering in the face of
our devotion -- in the face of death. Our vague and imperfect morality
rose with disgust at his unmanly lie. But he stuck to it manfully -- amazingly.
No! It couldn't be. He was at all extremity. His cantankerous temper was
only the result of the

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 54</TT>

<P>provoking invincibleness of that death he felt by his side. Any man
may be angry with such a masterful chum. 'But, then, what kind of men were
we -- with our thoughts! Indignation and doubt grappled within us in a
scuffle that trampled upon the finest of our feelings. And we hated him
because of the suspicion; we detested him because of the doubt. We could
not scorn him safely -- neither could we pity him without risk to our dignity.
So we hated him, and passed him carefully from hand to hand. We cried,
&amp;lsquo;Got him? -- &amp;lsquo;Yes, all right. Let go.&amp;rsquo; and
he swung from one enemy to another, showing about as much life as an old
bolster would do. His eyes made two narrow white slits in the black face.
He breathed slowly, and the air escaped through his lips with a noise like
the sound of bellows. We reached the poop ladder at last, and it being
a comparatively safe place, we lay for a moment in an exhausted heap to
rest a little. He began to mutter. We were always incurably anxious to
hear what he had to say. This time he mumbled peevishly. &amp;lsquo;It
took you some time to come. I began to think the whole smart lot of you
had been washed overboard. What kept you back? Hey? Funk?&amp;rsquo; We
said nothing. With sighs we started again to drag him up. The secret and
ardent desire of our hearts was to beat him viciously with our fists about
the head and we handled him as tenderly as though he had been made of glass.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The return on the poop was like the return of wanderers
after many years amongst people marked by the desolation of time. Eyes
were turned slowly in their sockets glancing at us. Faint murmurs were
heard. &amp;lsquo;Have you got 'im after all?&amp;rsquo; The well-known
faces looked strange and familiar; they seemed faded and grimy; they had
a mingled expression of fatigue and eagerness. They seemed to have become
much thinner during our absence, as if all these men had been starving
for a long time in their abandoned attitudes. The captain, with a round
turn of a rope on his wrist, and kneeling on one knee, swung with a face
cold and stiff but with living eyes he was still holding the ship up heeding
no one, as if lost in the unearthly effort of that endeavour. We fastened
up James Wait in a safe place. Mr. Baker scrambled along to lend a hand.
Mr. Creighton, on his back, and very pale, muttered, &amp;lsquo;Well done,&amp;rsquo;
and gave us, Jimmy and the sky, a scornful glance, then closed his eyes
slowly. Here and there a man stirred a little, but most remained

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 55</TT>

<P>apathetic, in cramped positions, muttering between shivers. The sun
was setting. A sun enormous, unclouded and red, declining low as if bending
down to look in their faces. The wind whistled across long sunbeams that,
resplendent and cold, struck full on the dilated pupils of staring eyes
without making them wink. The wisps of hair and the tangled beards were
grey with the salt of the sea. The faces were earthy, and the dark patches
under the eyes extended to the ears, smudged into the hollows of sunken
cheeks. The lips were livid and thin, and when they moved it was difficulty,
as though they had been glued to the teeth. Some grinned sadly in the sunlight,
shaking with cold. Others were sad and still. Charley, subdued by the sudden
disclosure of the insignificance of his youth, darted fearful glances.
The two smooth-faced Norwegians resembled decrepid children, staring stupidly.
To leeward, on the edge of the horizon, black seas leaped up towards the
glowing sun. It sank slowly, round and blazing, and the crests of waves
splashed on the edge of the luminous circle. One of the Norwegians appeared
to catch sight of it, and, after giving a violent start, began to speak.
His voice, startling the others, made them stir. They moved their heads
stiffly, or turning with difficulty, looked at him with surprise, with
fear, or in grave silence. He chattered at the setting sun, nodding his
head, while the big seas began to roll across the crimson disc; and over
miles of turbulent waters the shadows of high waves swept with a running
darkness the faces of men. A crested roller broke with a loud hissing roar,
and the sun, as if put out disappeared. The chattering voice faltered,
went out together with the light. There were sighs. In the sudden lull
that follows the crash of a broken sea a man said wearily, &amp;lsquo;Here's
that bloomin' Dutchman gone off his chump.&amp;rsquo; A seaman, lashed
by the middle, tapped the deck with his open hand with unceasing quick
flaps. In the gathering greyness of twilight a bulky form was seen rising
aft, and began marching on all fours with the movements of some big cautious
beast. It was Mr. Baker passing along the line of men. He grunted encouragingly
over every one, felt their fastenings. Some, with half-open eyes, puffed
like men oppressed by heat; others, mechanically and in dreamy voices answered
him, &amp;lsquo;Aye! aye! sir!&amp;rsquo; He went from one to another grunting,
&amp;lsquo; Ough!....See her through it yet;&amp;rsquo; and unexpectedly,

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 56</TT>

<P>with loud angry outbursts, blew up Knowles for cutting off a long piece
from the fall of the relieving tackle. &amp;lsquo;Ough! -- Ashamed of yourself
-- Relieving tackle -- Don't you know better! -- Ough! -- Able seaman!
Ough!&amp;rsquo; The lame man was crushed. He muttered, &amp;lsquo;Get
som'think for a lashing for myself, sir.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Ough!Lashing
-- yourself. Are you a tinker or a sailor -- What?Ough! -- May want that
tackle directly -- Ough!More use to the ship than your lame carcass. Ough!
-- Keep it!Keep it, now you've done it.&amp;rsquo; He crawled away slowly,
muttering to himself about some men being &amp;lsquo;worse than children.&amp;rsquo;
It had been a comforting row. Low exclamations were heard: &amp;lsquo;Hallo....Hallo....&amp;rsquo;
Those who had been painfully dozing asked with convulsive starts, &amp;lsquo;What's
up?....What is it?&amp;rsquo; The answers came with unexpected cheerfulness:&amp;lsquo;The
mate is going bald-headed for lame Jack about something or other.&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;No!....&amp;rsquo;&amp;lsquo;What 'as he done?&amp;rsquo; Some
even chuckled. It was like a whiff of hope, like a reminder of safe days.
Donkin, who had been stupefied with fear, revived suddenly and began to
shout: -- &amp;lsquo;'Ear 'im; that's the way they tawlk to hus. Vy donch
'ee 'it 'im -- one ov yer? 'It 'im. 'It 'im! Comin' the mate hover hus.
We are as good men as 'ee! We're hall goin' to 'ell now. We 'ave been starved
in this rotten ship, an' now we're goin' to be drowned for them black-'earted
bullies! 'it 'im!&amp;rsquo; He shrieked in the deepening gloom, he blubbered
and sobbed, screaming: -- &amp;lsquo;'It 'im! 'It 'im!&amp;rsquo; The rage
and fear of his disregarded right to live tried the steadfastness of hearts
more than the menacing shadows of the night that advanced through the unceasing
clamor of the gale. From aft Mr. Baker was heard: -- &amp;lsquo;Is one
of you men going to stop him -- must I come along?cq. &amp;lsquo;Shut up!....&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Keep quiet!&amp;rsquo; cried various voices, exasperated, trembling
with cold. -- &amp;lsquo;You'll get one across the mug from me directly.&amp;rsquo;
said an invisible seaman, in a weary tone, &amp;lsquo;I won't let the mate
have the trouble.&amp;rsquo; He ceased and lay still with the silence of
despair. On the black sky the stars, coming out, gleamed over an inky sea
that, speckled with foam, flashed back at them the evanescent and pale
light of a dazzling whiteness born from the black turmoil of the waves.
Remote in the eternal calm they glittered hard and cold above the uproar
of the earth; they surrounded the vanquished and tormented ship on all
sides: more pitiless than the eyes of a triumphant mob and as unapproachable
as the hearts of men.

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 57</TT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The icy south wind howled exultingly under the sombre splendour
of the sky. The cold shook the men with a restless violence as though it
had tried to shake them to pieces. Short moans were swept unheard off the
stiff lips. Some complained in mutters of &amp;lsquo;not feeling themselves
below the waist&amp;rsquo;; while those who had closed their eyes, imagined
they had a block of ice on their chests. Others, alarmed at not feeling
any pain in their fingers, beat the deck feebly with their hands -- obstinate
and exhausted. Wamibo stared vacant and dreamy. The Scandinavians kept
on a meaningless mutter through chattering teeth. The spare Scotchmen,
with determined efforts, kept their lower jaws still. The West-country
men lay big and stolid in an invulnerable surliness. A man yawned and swore
in turns. Another breathed with a rattle in his throat. Two elderly hard-weather
shellbacks, fast side by side, whispered dismally to one another about
the landlady of a boarding-house in Sunderland, whom they both knew. They
extolled her motherliness and her liberality; they tried to talk about
the joint of beef and the big fire in the downstairs kitchen. The words
dying faintly on their lips, ended in light sighs. A sudden voice cried
into the cold night, &amp;lsquo;Oh Lord!&amp;rsquo; No one changed his
position or took any notice of the cry. One or two passed, with a repeated
and vague gesture, their hand over their faces, but most of them kept very
still. In the benumbed immobility of their bodies they were excessively
wearied by their thoughts, that rushed with the rapidity and vividness
of dreams. Now and then, by an abrupt and startling exclamation, they answered
the weird hail of some illusion; then, again, in silence contemplated the
vision of known faces and familiar things. They recalled the aspect of
forgotten shipmates and heard the voice of dead and gone skippers. They
remembered the noise of gaslit streets, the steamy heat of tap-rooms, or
the scorching sunshine of calm days at sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker left his insecure place, and crawled, with stoppages,
along the poop. In the dark and on all fours he resembled some carnivorous
animal prowling amongst corpses. At the break, propped to windward of a
stanchion, he looked down on the main deck. It seemed to him that the ship
had a tendency to stand up a little more. The wind had eased a little,
he thought, but the sea ran as high as ever. The waves foamed viciously,
and the lee side of the

<P>deck disappeared under a hissing whiteness as of boiling milk, while
the rigging sang steadily with a deep vibrating note, and, at every upward
swing of the ship, the wind rushed with a long-drawn clamour amongst the
spars. Mr. Baker watched very still. A man near him began to make a blabbing
noise with his lips, all at once and very loud, as though the cold had
broken brutally through him. He went on:&amp;lsquo;Ba -- ba -- ba -- brrr
-- brr -- ba -- ba -- &amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Stop that!&amp;rsquo; cried
Mr. Baker, groping in the dark. &amp;lsquo;Stop it!&amp;rsquo; He went
on shaking the leg he found under his hand. -- &amp;lsquo;What is it, sir?&amp;rsquo;
called out Belfast, in the tone of a man awakened suddenly:&amp;lsquo;we
are looking after that 'ere Jimmy.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Are you? Ough!
Don't make that row then. Who's that near you?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;It's
me -- the boatswain, sir,&amp;rsquo; growled the West-country man; &amp;lsquo;we
are trying to keep life in that poor devil.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Aye,
aye!&amp;rsquo; said Mr. Baker, &amp;lsquo;Do it quietly, can't you.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;He wants us to hold him up above the rail,&amp;rsquo; went
on the boatswain, with irritation, &amp;lsquo;says he can't breathe here
under our jackets.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;If we lift 'im, we drop 'im
overboard,&amp;rsquo; said another voice, &amp;lsquo;we can't feel our
hands with cold.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I don't care. I am choking!&amp;rsquo;
exclaimed James Wait in a clear tone. -- &amp;lsquo;Oh, no, my son,&amp;rsquo;
said the boatswain, desperately, &amp;lsquo;you don't go till we all go
on this fine night.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;You will see yete many a worse,&amp;rsquo;
said Mr. Baker, cheerfully. -- &amp;lsquo;It's no child's play, sir!&amp;rsquo;
answered the boatswain. &amp;lsquo;Some of us further aft, here, are in
a pretty bad way.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;If the blamed sticks had been
cut out of her she would be running along on her bottom now like any decent
ship, an' giv' us all a chance,&amp;rsquo; said some one, with a sigh.
-- &amp;lsquo;The old man wouldn't have it.... much he cares for us,&amp;rsquo;
whispered another. -- &amp;lsquo;Care for you!&amp;rsquo; exclaimed Mr.
Baker, angrily. &amp;lsquo;Why should he care for you? Are you a lot of
women passengers to be taken care of? We are here to take care of the ship
-- and some of you ain't up to that. Ough!.... What have you done so very
smart to be taken care of? Ough!....Some of you can't stand a bit of a
breeze without crying over it.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Come, sorr. We
ain't so bad,&amp;rsquo; protested Belfast, in a voice shaken by shivers;
&amp;lsquo;we ain't....brrr....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Again,&amp;rsquo;
shouted the mate, grabbing at the shadowy form; &amp;lsquo;again!....Why,
you're in your shirt! What have you done?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I've
put my oilskin and jacket over that half-dead nayggur -- and he says he
chokes,&amp;rsquo; said Belfast, complainingly. -- &amp;lsquo;You wouldn't
call me nigger if I wasn't half dead

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 59</TT>

<P>you Irish beggar!&amp;rsquo; boomed James Wait, vigorously. -- &amp;lsquo;You....brrr....You
wouldn't be white if you were ever so well....I will fight you....brrr....
in fine weather....brrr....with one hand tied behind my back....brrr....&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;I don't want your rags -- I want air,&amp;rsquo; gasped out
the other faintly, as if suddenly exhausted.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sprays swept over the whistling and pattering. Men
disturbed in their peaceful torpor by the pain of quarrelsome shouts, moaned,
muttering curses. Mr. Baker crawled off a little way to leeward where a
water-cask loomed up big, with something white against it. &amp;lsquo;Is
it you, Podmore?&amp;rsquo; asked Mr. Baker. He had to repeat the question
twice before the cook turned, coughing feebly. -- &amp;lsquo;Yes, sir.
I've been praying in my mind for a quick deliverance; for I am prepared
for any call.....I -- &amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Look here, cook,&amp;rsquo;
interrupted Mr. baker, &amp;lsquo;the men are perishing with cold.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Cold!&amp;rsquo; said the cook, mournfully; &amp;lsquo;they
will be warm enough before long.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;What?&amp;rsquo;
asked Mr. Baker, looking along the deck into the faint sheen of frothing
water. -- &amp;lsquo;They are a wicked lot,&amp;rsquo; continued the cook
solemnly, but in an unsteady voice, &amp;lsquo;about as wicked as any ship's
company in this sinful world! Now, I&amp;rsquo; -- he trembled so that
he could hardly speak; his was an exposed place, and in a cotton shirt,
a thin pair of trousers, and with his knees under his nose, he received,
quaking, the flicks of stinging, salt drops; his voice sounded exhausted
-- &amp;lsquo;now, I -- any time....My eldest youngster, Mr. Baker....a
clever boy....last Sunday on shore before this voyage he wouldn't go to
church, sir. Says I, "You go and clean yourself or I'll know the reason
why!" What does he do?....Pond, Mr. Baker -- fell into the pond in his
best rig, sir!.... Accident?...."Nothing will save you, fine scholar though
you are!" says I.....Accident!....I whopped 'im!&amp;rsquo; he repeated,
rattling his teeth; then, after a while, let out a mournful sound that
was half a groan, half a snore. Mr. Baker shook him by the shoulders. &amp;lsquo;Hey!
Cook! Hold up, Podmore! Tell me -- is there any fresh water in the galley
tank? The ship is lying along less, I think; I would try to get forward.
A little water would do them good. Hallo! Look out! Look out!&amp;rsquo;
The cook struggled. -- &amp;lsquo;Not you, sir -- not you!&amp;rsquo; He
began to scramble to windward. &amp;lsquo;Galley!....my business!&amp;rsquo;
he shouted. --

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 60</TT>

<P>&amp;lsquo;Cook's going crazy now,&amp;rsquo; said several voices. He
yelled: -- &amp;lsquo;Crazy, am I? I am more ready to die than any of you,
officers incloosive -- there! As long as she swims I will cook! I will
get you coffee.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Cook, ye are a gentleman!&amp;rsquo;
cried Belfast. But the cook was already going over the weather ladder.
He stopped for a minute to shout back on the poop: -- &amp;lsquo;'as long
as she swims I will cook!&amp;rsquo; and disappeared as though he had gone
overboard. The men who had heard sent after him a cheer that sounded like
a wail of sick children. An hour or more afterwards some one said distinctly:
&amp;lsquo;He's gone for good.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Very likely,&amp;rsquo;
assented the boatswain; &amp;lsquo;even in fine weather he was as smart
about the deck as a milch-cow on her first voyage. We ought to go and see.&amp;rsquo;
Nobody moved. As the hours dragged slowly through the darkness Mr. Baker
crawled back and forth along the poop several times. Some men fancied they
had heard him exchange murmurs with the master, but at that time the memories
were incomparably more vivid than anything actual, and they were not certain
whether the murmurs were heard now or many years ago. They did not try
to find out. A mutter more or less did not matter. It was too cold for
curiosity, and almost for hope. They could not spare a moment or a thought
from the great mental occupation of wishing to live. And the desire of
life kept them alive, apathetic, and enduring, under the cruel persistence
of wind and cold; while the bestarred black dome of the sky revolved slowly
above the ship, that drifted, bearing their patience and their suffering,
through the stormy solitude of the sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Huddled close to one another, they fancied themselves utterly
alone. They heard sustained loud noises and again bore the pain of existence
through long hours of profound silence. In the night they saw sunshine,
felt warmth, and suddenly, with a start, thought that the sun would never
rise upon a freezing world. Some heard laughter, listened to songs; others,
near the end of the poop, could hear loud human shrieks, and, opening their
eyes, were surprised to hear them still, though very faint, and far away.
The boatswain said: -- &amp;lsquo;Why, it's the cook, hailing &amp;rsquo;
from forward I think.&amp;rsquo; He hardly believed his own words or recognised
his own voice. It was a long time before the man next to him gave a sign
of life. He punched hard his other neighbour and said: -- &amp;lsquo;The
cook's

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 61</TT>

<P>shouting!&amp;rsquo; Many did not understand, others did not care; the
majority further aft did not believe. But the boatswain and another men
had the pluck to crawl away forward to see. They seemed to have been gone
for hours, and were soon forgotten. Then suddenly men that had been plunged
in a hopeless resignation became as if possessed with a desire to hurt.
They belaboured one another with fists. In the darkness they struck persistently
anything soft they could feel near, and, with a greater effort than for
a shout, whispered excitedly: -- &amp;lsquo;They've got some hot coffee.....
Bosun got it.....&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;No!....Where?&amp;rsquo;.... &amp;lsquo;It's
coming! Cook made it.&amp;rsquo; James Wait moaned. Donkin scrambled viciously,
caring not where he kicked, and anxious that the officers should have none
of it. It came in a pot, and they drank in turns. It was hot, and while
it blistered the greedy palates, it seemed incredible. The men sighed out
parting with the mug: -- &amp;lsquo;'How 'as he done it?&amp;rsquo; Some
cried weakly -- &amp;lsquo;Bully for you, doctor!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had done it somehow. Afterwards Archie declared that
the thing was &amp;lsquo;meeraculous.&amp;rsquo; For many days we wondered,
and it was the one ever-interesting subject of conversation to the end
of the voyage. We asked the cook, in fine weather, how he felt when he
saw his stove &amp;lsquo;reared up on end.&amp;rsquo; We inquired, in the
north-east trade and on serene evenings, whether he had to stand on his
head to put things right somewhat. We suggested he had used his bread-board
for a raft, and from there comfortably had stoked his grate; and we did
our best to conceal our admiration under the wit of fine irony. He affirmed
not to know anything about it, rebuked our levity, declared himself, with
solemn animation, to have been the object of special mercy for the saving
of our unholy lives. Fundamentally he was right, no doubt; but he need
not have been so offensively positive about it -- he need not have hinted
so often that it would have gone hard with us had he not been there, meritorious
and pure, to receive the inspiration and the strength for the work of grace.
Had we been saved by his recklessness or his agility, we could have at
length become reconciled to the fact; but to admit our obligation to anybody's
virtue and holiness alone was as difficult for us as for any other handful
of mankind. Like many benefactors of humanity, the cook took himself too
seriously, and reaped the reward of irreverence. We were not ungrateful,

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 62</TT>

<P>however. He remained heroic. His saying -- <I>the</I> saying of his
life -- became proverbial in the mouths of men as are the sayings of conquerors
or sages. Later on, whenever one of us was puzzled by a task and advised
to relinquish it, he would express his determination to persevere and to
succeed by the words: -- &amp;lsquo;As long as she swims I will cook!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hot drink helped us through the bleak hours that precede
the dawn. The sky low by the horizon took on the delicate tints of pink
and yellow like the inside of a rare shell. And higher, where it glowed
with a pearly sheen, a small black cloud appeared, like a forgotten fragment
of the night set in a border of dazzling gold. The beams of light skipped
on the crests of waves. The eyes of men turned to the eastward. The sunlight
flooded their weary faces. They were giving themselves up to fatigue as
though they had done for ever with their work. On Singleton's black oilskin
coat the dried salt glistened like hoar frost. He hung on by the wheel,
with open and lifeless eyes. Captain Allistoun, unblinking, faced the rising
sun. His lips stirred, opened for the first time in twenty-four hours,
and with a fresh firm voice he cried, &amp;lsquo;Wear ship!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The commanding sharp tones made all these torpid men start
like a sudden flick of a whip. Then again, motionless where they lay, the
force of habit made some of them repeat the order in hardly audible murmurs.
Captain Allistoun glanced down at his crew, and several, with fumbling
fingers and hopeless movements, tried to cast themselves adrift. He repeated
impatiently, &amp;lsquo;Wear ship. Now then, Mr. Baker, get the men along.
What's the matter with them?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Wear ship. Do you
hear there? -- Wear ship!&amp;rsquo;thundered out the boatswain suddenly.
His voice seemed to break through the deadly spell. Men began to stir and
crawl, -- &amp;lsquo;I want the fore-top-mast stay-sail run up smartly,&amp;rsquo;
said the master, very loudly; &amp;lsquo;if you can't manage it standing
up you must do it lying down -- that's all. Bear a hand!&amp;rsquo; --
&amp;lsquo;Come along! Let's give the old girl a chance.&amp;rsquo; urged
the boatswain. -- &amp;lsquo;Aye! aye! Wear ship!&amp;rsquo; exclaimed
quavering voices. The forecastle men, with reluctant faces, prepared to
go forward. Mr. Baker pushed ahead grunting on all fours to show the way,
and they followed him over the break. The others lay still with a vile
hope in their hearts of not being required to move till they got saved
or drowned in peace.

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 63</TT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After some time they could be seen forward appearing on
the forecastle head, one by one in unsafe attitudes; hanging on to the
rails; clambering over the anchors; embracing the cross-head of the windlass
or hugging the fore-capstan. They were restless with strange exertions,
waved their arms, knelt, lay flat down, staggered up, seemed to strive
their hardest to go overboard. Suddenly a small white piece of canvas fluttered
amongst them, grew larger, beating. Its narrow head rose in jerks -- and
at last it stood distended and triangular in the sunshine. -- &amp;lsquo;They
have done it!&amp;rsquo; cried the voices aft. Captain Allistoun let go
the rope he had round his wrist and rolled to leeward headlong. He could
be seen casting the lee main braces off the pins while the backwash of
waves splashed over him. -- &amp;lsquo;Square the main yard!&amp;rsquo;
he shouted up to us -- who stared at him in wonder. We hesitated to stir.
&amp;lsquo;The main brace, men. Haul! haul anyhow! Lay on your backs and
haul!&amp;rsquo;he screeched, half drowned down there. We did not believe
we could move the main yard, but the strongest and the less discouraged
tried to execute the order. Others assisted half-heartedly. Singleton's
eyes blazed suddenly as he took a fresh grip of the spokes. Captain Allistoun
fought his way up to the windward. -- &amp;lsquo;Haul men! Try to move
it! Haul, and help the ship.&amp;rsquo; His hard face worked suffused and
furious. &amp;lsquo;Is she going off, Singleton?&amp;rsquo; He cried. --
&amp;lsquo;Not a move yet, sir,&amp;rsquo; croaked the old seaman in a
horribly hoarse voice. -- &amp;lsquo;Watch the helm, Singleton.&amp;rsquo;
spluttered the master. &amp;lsquo;Haul men! Have you no more strength than
rats? Haul, and earn your salt.&amp;rsquo; Mr. Creighton, on his back,
with a swollen leg and a face as white as a piece of paper, blinked his
eyes, his bluish lips twitched. In the wild scramble men grabbed at him,
crawled over his hurt leg, knelt on his chest. He kept perfectly still,
setting his teeth without a moan, without a sigh. The master's ardour,
the cries of that silent man inspired us. We hauled and hung in bunches
on the rope. We heard him say with violence to Donkin, who sprawled abjectly
on his stomach, -- &amp;lsquo;I will brain you with this belaying pin if
you don't catch hold of the brace,&amp;rsquo; and that victim of men's
injustice, cowardly and cheeky, whimpered; -- &amp;lsquo;Are you going
ter murder hus now?&amp;rsquo; While, with sudden desperation he grabbed
the rope. Men sighed, shouted, hissed meaningless words, groaned. The yards
moved, came slowly square against the wind, that hummed loudly

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 64</TT>

<P>on the yard-arms. -- &amp;lsquo;Going off, sir,&amp;rsquo; shouted Singleton,
&amp;lsquo;she's just started.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Catch a turn with
that brace. Catch a turn!&amp;rsquo; clamoured the master. Mr. Creighton,
nearly suffocated and unable to move, made a mighty effort, and with his
left hand managed to nip the rope. -- &amp;lsquo;All fast!&amp;rsquo; cried
someone. He closed his eyes as if going off into a swoon, while huddled
together about the brace we watched with scared looks what the ship would
do now.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She went off slowly as though she had been weary and disheartened
like the men she carried. She paid off very gradually, making us hold our
breath till we choked, and as soon as she had brought the wind abaft the
beam she started to move, and fluttered our hearts. It was awful to see
her, nearly overturned, begin to gather way and drag her submerged side
through the water. The dead-eyes of the rigging churned the breaking seas.
The lower half of the deck was full of mad whirlpools and eddies; and the
long line of the ice rail could be seen showing black now and then in the
swirls of a field of foam as dazzling and white as a field of snow. The
wind sang shrilly amongst the spars; and at every slight lurch we expected
her to slip to the bottom sideways from under our backs. When dead before
it she made the first distinct attempt to stand up, and we encouraged her
with a feeble and discordant howl. A great sea came running up aft and
hung for a moment over us with a curling top; then crashed down under the
counter and spread out on both sides into a great sheet of bursting froth.
Above its fierce hiss we heard Singleton's croak: -- &amp;lsquo;She is
steering!&amp;rsquo; He had both his feet now planted firmly on the grating,
and the wheel spun fast as he eased the helm. -- &amp;lsquo;Bring the wind
on the port quarter and steady her!&amp;rsquo; called out the master, staggering
to his feet, the first man up from amongst our prostrate heap. One or two
screamed with excitement: -- &amp;lsquo;She rises!&amp;rsquo; Far away
forward, Mr. Baker and three others were seen erect and and black on the
clear sky, lifting their arms, and with open mouths as though they had
been shouting all together. The ship trembled, trying to lift her side,
lurched back, seemed to give up with a nerveless dip, and suddenly with
an unexpected jerk swung violently to windward, as though she had torn
herself out from a deadly grasp. The whole immense volume of water, lifted
by her deck, was thrown bodily across to starboard. Loud cracks were heard.
Iron ports breaking

<P>

<P><TT>Page 65</TT>

<P>open thundered with ringing blows. The water topped over the starboard
rail with the rush of a river falling over a dam. The sea on deck, and
the seas on every side of her, mingled together in a deafening roar. She
rolled violently. We got up and were helplessly run or flung about from
side to side. Men, rolling over and over, yelled. -- &amp;lsquo;The house
will go!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;She clears herself!&amp;rsquo; Lifted
by a towering sea she ran along with it for a moment, spouting thick streams
of water through every opening of her wounded sides. The ice braces having
been carried away or washed off the pins, all the ponderous yards on the
fore swung from side to side and with appalling rapidity at every roll.
The men forward were seen crouching here and there with fearful glances
upwards at the enormous spars that whirled about over their heads. The
torn canvas and the ends of broken gear streamed in the wind like wisps
of hair. Through the clear sunshine, over the flashing turmoil and uproar
of the seas, the ship ran blindly, dishevelled and headlong, as if fleeing
for her life; and on the poop we spun, we tottered about, distracted and
noisy. We all spoke at once in a thin babble; we had the aspect of invalids
and the gestures of maniacs. Eyes shone, large and haggard, in smiling,
meaagre faces that seemed to have been dusted over with powdered chalk.
We stamped, clapped our hands, feeling ready to jump and do anything, but
in reality hardly able to keep on our feet. Captain Allistoun, hard and
slim, gesticulated madly from the poop at Mr. Baker; &amp;lsquo;Steady
these fore-yards! Steady them the best you can!&amp;rsquo; On the main
deck, men excited by his cries, splashed, dashing aimlessly here and there
with the foam swirling up to their waists. Apart, far aft, and alone by
the helm, old Singleton had deliberately tucked his white beard under the
top button of his glistening coat. Swaying upon the din and tumult of the
seas, with the whole battered length of the ship launched forward in a
rolling rush before his steady old eyes, he stood rigidly still, forgotten
by all, and with an attentive face. In front of his erect figure only the
two arms moved crosswise with a swift and sudden readiness, to check or
urge again the rapid stir of circling spokes. He steered with care.
