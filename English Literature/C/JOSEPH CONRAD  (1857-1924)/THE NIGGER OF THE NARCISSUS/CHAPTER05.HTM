&nbsp;&nbsp; A heavy atmosphere of oppressive quietude pervaded the ship.
In the afternoon men went about washing clothes and hanging them out to
dry in the unprosperous breeze with the meditative language of disenchanted
philosophers. Very little was said. The problem of life seemed too voluminous
for the narrow limits of human speech, and by common consent it was abandoned
to the great sea that had from the beginning enfolded it in its immense
grip; to the sea that knew all, and would in time infallibly unveil to
each the wisdom hidden in all the errors, the certitude that lurks in doubts,
the realm of safety and peace beyond the frontiers of sorrow and fear.
And in the confused current of impotent thoughts that set unceasingly this
way and that through bodies of men, Jimmy bobbed up upon the surface, compelling
attention, like a black buoy chained to the bottom of a muddy stream. Falsehood
triumphed. It triumphed through doubt, through stupidity through pity,
through sentimentalism. We set ourselves to bolster it up, from compassion
from recklessness, from a sense of fun. Jimmy's steadfastness to his untruthful
attitude in the face of the inevitable truth had the proportions of a colossal
enigma -- of a manifestation grand and incomprehensible that at times inspired
a wondering awe; and there was also, to many, something exquisitely droll
in fooling him thus to the top of his bent. The latent egoism of tenderness
to suffering appeared in the developing anxiety not to see

<P>him die. His obstinate non-recognition of the only certitude whose approach
we could watch from day to day was as disquieting as the failure of some
law of nature. He was so utterly wrong about himself that one could not
but suspect him of having access to some source of supernatural knowledge.
He was absurd to the point of inspiration. He was unique, and as fascinating
as only something inhuman could be; he seemed to shout his denials already
from beyond the awful border. He was becoming immaterial like an apparition;
his cheekbones rose, the forehead slanted more; the face was all hollows,
patches of shade; and the fleshless head resembled a disinterred black
skull, fitted with two restless globes of silver in the sockets of eyes.
He was demoralising. Through him we were becoming highly humanised, tender,
complex, excessively decadent: we understood the subtlety of his fear,
sympathised with all his repulsions, shrinkings evasions, delusions --
as though we had been over-civilised, and rotten, and without any knowledge
of the meaning of life. We had the air of being initiated in some infamous
mysteries; we had the profound grimaces of conspirators, exchanged meaning
glances, significant short words. We were inexpressibly vile and very much
pleased with ourselves. We lied to him with gravity, with emotion, with
unction, as if performing some moral trick with a view to an eternal reward.
We made a chorus of affirmation to his wildest assertions, as though he
had been a millionaire, a politician, or a reformer -- and we a crowd of
ambitious lubbers. When we ventured to question his statements we did it
after the manner of obsequious sycophants. to the end that his glory should
be augmented by the flattery of our dissent. He influenced the moral tone
of our world as though he had it in his power to distribute honours, treasures,
or pain; and he could give ua nothing but his contempt. It was immense;
it seemed to grow gradually larger, as his body day by day shrank a little
more, while we looked. It was the only thing about him -- of him -- that
gave the impression of durability and vigour. It lived within him with
an unquenchable life. It spoke through the eternal pout of his black lips;
it looked at us through the profound impertinence of his large eyes, that
stood far out of his head like the eyes of crabs. We watched them intently.
Nothing else of him stirred. He seemed unwilling to move, as if distrustful
of his own solidity. The slightest gesture must have disclosed to him (it
could not surely be otherwise) his bodily weakness, and caused a pang of
mental suffering. He was chary of movements. He lay stretched out, chin
on blanket, in a kind of sly, cautious immobility. Only his eyes roamed
over faces: his eyes disdainful, penetrating and sad.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at that time that Belfast's devotion -- and also
his pugnacity -- secured universal respect. He spent every moment of his
spare time in Jimmy 's cabin. He tended him, talked to him; was as gentle
as a woman, as tenderly gay as an old philanthropist, as sentimentally
careful of his nigger as a model slave-owner. But outside he was irritable,
explosive as gunpowder, sombre, suspicious, and never more brutal than
when most sorrowful. With him it was a tear and a blow: a tear for Jimmy,
a blow for any one who did not seem to take a scrupulously orthodox view
of Jimmy's case. We talked about nothing else. The two Scandinavians, even,
discussed the situation -- but it was impossible to know in what spirit,
because they quarreled in their own language. Belfast suspected them of
irreverence, and in this incertitude thought that there was no option but
to fight them both. They became very much terrified by his truculence,
and henceforth lived amongst us, dejected, like a pair of mutes. Wamibo
never spoke intelligibly, but he was as smileless as an animal -- seemed
to know much less about it all than the cat -- and consequently was safe.
Moreover he had belonged to the chosen band of Jimmy's rescuers, and was
above suspicion. Archie was silent generally, but often spent an hour or
so talking to Jimmy quietly with an air of proprietorship. At any time
of the day and often through the night some man could be seen sitting on
Jimmy's box. In the evening, between six and eight, the cabin was crowded,
and there was an interested group at the door. Every one stared at the
nigger.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He basked in the warmth of our interest. His eyes gleamed
ironically, and in a weak voice he reproached us with our cowardice. He
would say, &amp;lsquo;If you fellows had stuck out for me I would be now
on deck.&amp;rsquo; We hung our heads. &amp;lsquo;Yes, but if you think
I am going to let them put me in irons just to show you sport....Well,
no....It ruins my health, this lying up, it does. You don't care.&amp;rsquo;
We were as

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 105</TT>

<P>abashed as if it had been true. His superb impudence carried all before
it. We would not have dared to revolt. We didn't want to really. We wanted
to keep him alive till home -- to the end of the voyage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singleton as usual held aloof, appearing to scorn the insignificant
events of an ended life. Once only he came along, and unexpectedly stopped
in the doorway. He peered at Jimmy in profound silence, as if desirous
to add that black image to the crowd of Shades that peopled his old memory.
We kept very quiet and for a long time Singleton stood there as though
he had come by appointment to call for some one, or to see some important
event. James Wait lay perfectly still and apparently not aware of the gaze
scrutinising him with a steadiness full of expectation. There was a sense
of tussle in the air. We felt the inward strain of men watching a wrestling
bout. At last Jimmy with perceptible apprehension turned his head on the
pillow. -- &amp;lsquo;Good evening,&amp;rsquo; he said in a conciliating
tone. -- &amp;lsquo;H'm,&amp;rsquo; answered the old seaman, grumpily.
For a moment longer he looked at Jimmy with severe fixity, then suddenly
went away. It was a long time before any one spoke in the little cabin,
though we all breathed more freely as men do after an escape from some
dangerous situation. We all knew the old man's ideas about Jimmy, and nobody
dared to combat them. They were unsettling they caused pain; and, what
was worse, they might have been true for all we knew. Only once did he
condescend to explain them fully, but the impression was lasting. He said
that Jimmy was the cause of head winds. Mortally sick men -- he maintained
-- linger till the first sight of land, and then die; and Jimmy knew that
the land would draw his life from him. It is so in every shi. Didn't we
know it? He asked us with austere contempt: what did we know? What would
we doubt next? Jimmy's desire encouraged by us and aided by Wamibo's spells
delayed the ship in the open sea. Only lubberly fools couldn't see it.
Whoever heard of such a run of calms and head winds? It wasn't natural....
We could not deny that it was strange. We felt uneasy. The common saying,
&amp;lsquo;more days, more dollars,&amp;rsquo; did not give the usual comfort
because the stores were running short. Much had been spoiled off the Cape,
and we were on half allowance of biscuit. Peas, sugar and tea had been
finished

<P>long ago. Salt meat was giving out. We had plenty of coffee but very
little water to make it with. We took up another hole in our belts and
went on scraping, polishing, painting the ship from morning to night. And
soon she looked as though she had come out of a band-box; but hunger lived
on board of her. Not dead starvation, but steady, living hunger that stalked
about on the decks, slept in the forecastle; the tormentor of waking moments,
the disturber of dreams. We looked to windward for signs of change. Every
few hours of night and da y we put her round with the hope that she would
come up on that tack at last! She didn't. She seemed to have forgotten
the way home; she rushed to and fro, heading north-west, heading east;
she ran backwards and forwards, distracted, like a timid creature at the
foot of a wall. Sometimes, as if tired to death, she would wallow languidly
for a day in the smooth swell of an unruffled sea. All up to the swinging
masts the sails thrashed furiously through the hot stillness of the calm.
We were weary, hungry, thirsty; we commenced to believe Singleton, but
with unshaken fidelity dissembled to Jimmy. We spoke to him with jocose
allusiveness, like cheerful accomplices in a clever plot; but we looked
to the westward over the rail with mournful eyes for a sign of hope, for
a sign of fair wind; even if its first breath should bring death to our
reluctant Jimmy. In vain! The universe conspired with James Wait. Light
airs from the northward sprung up again; the sky remained clear; and round
our weariness the glittering sea. touched by the breeze, basked voluptuously
in the great sunshine, as though it had forgotten our life and trouble.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin looked out for a fair wind along with the rest.
No one knew the venom of his thoughts now. He was silent, and appeared
thinner, as if consumed slowly by an inward rage at the injustice of men
and fate. He was ignored by all and spoke to no one, but his hate for every
man looked out through his eyes. He talked with the cook only, having somehow
persuaded the good man that he -- Donkin -- was a much calumniated and
persecuted person. Together they bewailed the immorality of the ship's
company. There could be no greater criminals than we, who by our lies conspired
to send the soul of a poor ignorant black man to ever-lasting perdition.
Podmore cooked what there was to cook, remorsefully,

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 107</TT>

<P>and felt all the time that by preparing the food of such sinners he
imperilled his own salvation. As to the Captain -- he had lived with him
for seven years, he said, and would not have believed it possible that
such a man....&amp;lsquo;Well. Well....There it is.... Can't get out of
it. Judgment capsized all in a minute....Struck in all his pride....More
like a visitation than anything else.&amp;rsquo; Donkin, perched sullenly
on the coal-locker, swung his legs and concurred. He paid in the coin of
spurious assent for the privilege to sit in the galley; he was disheartened
and scandalised; he agreed with the cook; could find no words severe enough
to criticise our conduct; and when in the heat of reprobation he swore
at us, Podmore, who would have liked to swear also if it hadn't been for
his principles, pretended not to hear. So Donkin, unrebuked, cursed enough
for two, cadged for matches, borrowed tobacco, and loafed for hours, very
much at home before the stove. From there he could hear us on the other
side of the bulkhead, talking to Jimmy. The cook knocked the pots about,
slammed the oven door, muttered prophecies of damnation for all the ship's
company; and Donkin, who did not admit of any hereafter, except for the
purposes of blasphemy, listened, concentrated and angry, gloating fiercely
over a called-up image of infinite torment -- like men gloat over the accursed
images of cruelty and revenge, of greed, and of power.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On clear evenings the silent ship, under the cold sheen
of the dead moon, took on the false aspect of passionless repose resembling
the winter of the earth. Under her a long band of gold barred the black
disc of the sea. Footsteps echoed on her quiet decks. The moonlight clung
to her like a frosted mist, and the white sails stood out in dazzling cones
as of stainless snow. In the magnificence of the phantom rays the ship
appeared pure like a vision of ideal beauty, illusive like a tender dream
of serene peace. And nothing in her was real, nothing was distinct and
solid but the heavy shadows that filled her decks with their unceasing
and noiseless stir; the shadows blacker than the night and more restless
than the thoughts of men.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin prowled spiteful and alone amongst the shadows,
thinking that Jimmy too long delayed to die. That evening, just before
dark, land had been reported from aloft, and the master,

<P>while adjusting the tubes of the long glass, had observed with quiet
bitterness to Mr. Baker that, after fighting our way inch by inch to the
Western Islands there was nothing to expect now but a spell of calm. The
sky was clear and the barometer high. The light breeze dropped with the
sun, and an enormous stillness, the forerunner of a night without wind,
descended upon the heated waters of the ocean. As long as daylight lasted,
the hands collected on the forecastle-head watched on the eastern sky the
island of Flores, that rose above the level expanse of the sea with irregular
and broken outlines like a sombre ruin upon a vast and deserted plain.
It was the first land seen for nearly four months. Charley was excited,
and in the midst of general indulgence took liberties with his betters.
Men strangely elated without knowing why, talked in groups, and pointed
with bared arms. For the first time that voyage Jimmy's sham existence
seemed for a moment forgotten in the face of a solid reality. We had got
so far anyhow. Belfast discoursed, quoting imaginary examples of short
homeward passages from the Islands. &amp;lsquo;Them smart fruit schooners
do it in five days,&amp;rsquo; he affirmed. &amp;lsquo;What do you want?
-- only a good little breeze.&amp;rsquo; Archie maintained that seven days
was the shortest passage, and they disputed amicably with insulting words.
Knowles declared he could already smell home from there, and with a heavy
list on his short leg laughed fit to split his sides. A group of grizzled
sea-dogs looked out for a time in silence and with grim absorbed faces.
One said suddenly -- &amp;lsquo;Tain't far to London now.&amp;rsquo; --
&amp;lsquo;My first night ashore, blamme if I haven't steak and onions
for supper....and a pint of bitter,&amp;rsquo; said another. -- &amp;lsquo;A
barrel ye mean,&amp;rsquo; shouted some one. -- &amp;lsquo;Ham an' eggs
three times a day. That's the way I live!&amp;rsquo; cried an excited voice.
There was a stir, appreciative murmurs; eyes began to shine; jaws champed;
short nervous laughs were heard. Archie smiled with reserve all to himself.
Singleton came up, gave a negligent glance, and went down again without
saying a word, indifferent, like a man who had seen Flores an incalculable
number of times. The night travelling from the East blotted out of the
limpid sky the purple stain of the high land. &amp;lsquo;Dead calm,&amp;rsquo;
said somebody quietly. The murmur of lively talk suddenly wavered, died
out; the clusters broke up; men began to drift away one by one, descending
the ladders slowly and with serious faces as if sobered by that reminder
of their dependence upon the invisible. And when the big yellow moon ascended
gently above the sharp rim of the clear horizon it found the ship wrapped
up in a breathless silence; a fearless ship that seemed to sleep profoundly,
dreamlessly, on the bosom of the sleeping and terrible sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin chafed at the peace -- at the ship -- at the sea
that stretched away on all sides merged into the illimitable silence of
all creation. He felt himself pulled up sharp by unrecognised grievances.
He had been physically cowed, but his injured dignity remained indomitabe,
and nothing could heal his lacerated feelings. Here was land already --
home very soon -- a bad pay-day -- no clothes -- more hard work. How offensive
all this was. Land. The land draws away life from sick sailors. That nigger
there had money -- clothes -- easy times; and would not die. Land draws
life away....He felt tempted to go and see whether it did. Perhaps already....It
would be a bit of luck. There was money in the beggar's chest. He stepped
briskly out of the shadows into the moonlight, and, instantly, his craving,
hungry face from sallow became livid. He opened the door of the cabin and
had a shock. Sure enough, Jimmy was dead! He moved no more than a recumbent
figure with clasped hands, carved on the lid of a stone coffin. Donkin
glared with avidity. Then Jimmy, without stirring, blinked his eyelids,
and Donkin had another shock. Those eyes were rather startling. He shut
the door behind his back with gentle care, looking intently the while at
James Wait as though he had come in there at great risk to tell some secret
of startling importance. Jimmy did not move but glanced languidly out of
the corners of his eyes. &amp;lsquo;Calm?&amp;rsquo; he asked. -- &amp;lsquo;Yuss,&amp;rsquo;
said Donkin, very disappointed, and sat down on the box.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy breathed with composure. He was use to such visits
at all times of night or day. Men succeeded one another. They spoke in
clear voices, pronounced cheerful words, repeated old jokes, listened to
him; and each, going out, seemed to leave behind a little of his own vitality,
surrender some of his own strength, renew the assurance of life -- the
indestructable thing! He did not like to be alone in his cabin, because,
when he was alone, it seemed to him as if he hadn't been there at all.
There was nothing. No pain. Not now. Perfectly right -- but he couldn't
enjoy his healthful repose unless some one was by to see it. This man would
do as anybody. Donkin watched him stealthily. -- &amp;lsquo;Soon home now,&amp;rsquo;observed
Wait. -- &amp;lsquo;Why d'yer whisper?&amp;rsquo; asked Donkin with interest,
&amp;lsquo;can't you speak hupz?&amp;rsquo; Jimmy looked annoyed and said
nothing for a while; then in a lifeless unringing voice: -- &amp;lsquo;Why
should I shout? You ain't deaf that I know. -- &amp;lsquo;Oh! I can 'ear
right enough,&amp;rsquo; answered Donkin in a low tone, and looked down.
He was thinking sadly of going out when Jimmy spoke again. -- &amp;lsquo;Time
we did get home.....to get something decent to eat.... I am always hungry.&amp;rsquo;
Donkin felt angry all of a sudden. -- &amp;lsquo;What habout me,&amp;rsquo;
he hissed, &amp;lsquo;I am 'ungry too an' got ter work. You, 'ungry! --
&amp;lsquo; Your work won't kill you,&amp;rsquo; commented Wait, feebly;&amp;lsquo;there's
a couple of biscuits in the lower bunk there -- you may have one. I can't
eat them.&amp;rsquo; Donkin dived in, groped in the corner and when he
came up again his mouth was full. He munched with ardour. Jimmy seemed
to doze with open eyes. Donkin finished his hard bread and got up. -- &amp;lsquo;You're
not going? asked Jimmy, staring at the ceiling. -- &amp;lsquo;No,&amp;rsquo;
said Donkin impulsively, and instead of going out leaned his back against
the closed door. He looked at James Wait, and saw him long, lean, dried
up, as though all his flesh had shrivelled on his bones in the heat of
a white furnace; the meagre fingers of one hand moved lightly upon the
edge of the bunk playing an endless tune. To look at him was irritating
and fatiguing; he could last like this for days; he was outrageous -- belonging
wholly neither to death nor life, and perfectly invulnerable in his apparent
ignorance of both. Donkin felt tempted to enlighten him. -- &amp;lsquo;What
hare yer thinkin' of?&amp;rsquo; he asked surlily. James Wait had a grimacing
smile that passed over the deathlike impassiveness of his bony face. incredible
and frightful as would, in a dream, have been the sudden smile of a corpse.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;There is a girl,&amp;rsquo; whispered Wait....&amp;lsquo;Canton
Street girl -- She chucked a third engineer of a Rennie boat -- for me.
Cooks oysters just as I like....She says -- she would chuck -- any toff
-- for a coloured gentleman.... That's me. I am kind to women.&amp;rsquo;
he added a shade louder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin could hardly believe his ears. He was scandalised.
-- &amp;lsquo;Would she? Yer wouldn't be hany good to 'er,&amp;rsquo; he
said with unrestrained disgust. Wait was not there to hear him. He was

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 111</TT>

<P>swaggering up the east India Dock Road; saying kindly, &amp;lsquo;Come
along for a treat.&amp;rsquo; pushing glass swing-doors,, posing with superb
assurance in the gaslight above a mahogany counter. -- &amp;lsquo;D'yer
think yer will hever get ashore?&amp;rsquo; asked Donkin angrily. Wait
came back with a start. -- &amp;lsquo;Ten days,&amp;rsquo; he said promptly,
and returned at once to the regions of memory that know nothing of time.
He felt untired, calm , and as if safely withdrawn within himself beyond
the reach of every grave incertitude. There was something of the immutable
quality of eternity in the slow moments of his complete restfulness. He
was very quiet and easy amongst his vivid reminiscences which he mistook
joyfully for images of an undoubted future. He cared for no one. Donkin
felt this vaguely like a blind man may feel in his darkness the fatal antagonism
of all the surrounding existences, that to him shall for ever remain irrealisable,
unseen and enviable. He had a desire to assert his importance, to break,
to crush; to be even with everybody for everything; to tear the veil, unmask
expose, leave no refuge -- a perfidious desire of truthfulness! He laughed
in a mocking splutter and said:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Ten days. Strike me blind if I hever!....You
will be dead by this time to-morrow p'r'aps. Ten days!&amp;rsquo; He waited
for a while.&amp;lsquo;D'ye 'ear me? Blamme if yer don't look dead halready.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy must have been collecting his strength for he said
almost aloud -- &amp;lsquo;You're a stinking, cadging liar. Every one knows
you.&amp;rsquo; And sitting up, against all probability, startled his visitor
horribly. But very soon Donkin recovered himself. He blustered, &amp;lsquo;What?
What? Who's a liar? You hare -- the crowd hare -- the skipper -- heverybody.
I haint! Putting on hairs! w ho's yer?&amp;rsquo; He nearly choked himself
with indignation. &amp;lsquo;Who's yer to put on hairs,&amp;rsquo; he repeated
trembling. &amp;lsquo;'Ave one -- 'ave one, says 'ee -- an' cawn't heat
'em 'isself. Now I'll 'ave both. By Gawd -- I will! Yer nobody!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He plunged into the lower bunk, rooted in there and brought
to light another dusty biscuit. He held it up before Jimmy -- weethen took
a bite defiantly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;What now?&amp;rsquo; he asked with feverish
impatience. &amp;lsquo;Yer may take one -- says yer. Why not giv' me both?
No. I'm a mangy dorg. One for a mangy dorg.I'll tyke both. Can yer stop
me? Try. Come on. Try.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy was clasping his legs and hiding his face on the
knees. His shirt clung to him. Every rib was visible. His emaciated back
was shaken in repeated jerks by the panting catches of his breath.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Yer won't? Yer can't? What did I say?&amp;rsquo;
went on Donkin fiercely. He swallowed another dry mouthful with a hasty
effort. The other's silent helplessness, his weakness, his shrinking attitude
exasperated him.&amp;lsquo;Ye're done!&amp;rsquo; he cried. &amp;lsquo;Who's
yer to be lied to; to be waited on 'and and foot like a bloomin' hymperor.
Yer nobody. Yer no one at all!&amp;rsquo; he spluttered with such a strength
of unerring conviction that it shook him from head to foot in coming out,
and left him vibrating like a released string.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy rallied again. He lifted his head and turned bravely
at Donkin, who saw a strange face, an unknown face, a fantastic and grimacing
mask of despair and fury. Its lips moved rapidly; and hollow, moaning,
whistling sounds filled the cabin with a vague mutter full of menace, complaint
and desolation, like the far-off murmur of a rising wind. Wait shook his
head; rolled his eyes; he denied, cursed, menaced -- and not a word had
the strength to pass beyond the sorrowful pout of those black lips. It
was incomprehensible and disturbing; a gibberish of emotions, a frantic
dumb show of speech pleading for impossible things, threatening a shadowy
vengeance. It sobered Donkin into a scrutinising watchfulness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Yer can't holler. See? What did I tell yer?&amp;rsquo;
he said slowly after a moment of attentive examination. The other kept
on headlong and unheard, nodding passionately, grinning with grotesque
and appalling flashes of big white teeth. Donkin, as if fascinated by the
dumb eloquence and anger of that black phantom, approached, stretching
his neck out with distrustful curiosity; and it seemed to him suddenly
that he was looking only at the shadow of a man crouching high in the bunk
on the level with his eyes. -- &amp;lsquo;What? What?&amp;rsquo; he said.
He seemed to catch the shape of some words in the continuous panting hiss.
&amp;lsquo;Yer will tell Belfast! Will yer? Hare yer a bloomin' kid?&amp;rsquo;
He trembled with alarm and rage. &amp;lsquo;Tell yer gran'mother! Yer afeard!
Who's yer ter be afeard more'n hanyone?&amp;rsquo; His passionate sense
of his own importance ran away with a last remnant of caution. &amp;lsquo;Tell
an' be damned! Tell if yer can!&amp;rsquo; he cried. &amp;lsquo;I've been
treated worse'n a dorg by your blooming back-lickers. They 'as set me on,
honly to turn against me, I ham the honly man

<P>'ere. They choked me, kicked me -- an' yer laffed -- yer black, rotten
incumbrance, you! You will pay fur it. They giv' yer their grub, their
water -- yer will pay fur hit to me, by Gawd! Who haxed me ter 'ave a drink
of water? They put their bloomin' rags on yer that night, an' what did
they giv' ter me -- a clout on the bloomin' mouth -- blast their....S'elp
me!....Yer will pay fur hit with yer money. Hi'm goin' ter 'ave it in a
minyte; has soon has ye're dead, yer bloomin' useless fraud. That's the
man I ham. An ye're a thing -- -- a bloody thing. Yah -- you corpse!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He flung at Jimmy's head the biscuit he had been all the
time clutching hard, but it only grazed, and striking with a loud crack
the bulkhead beyond burst like a hand-grenade into flying pieces. James
Wait, as though wounded mortally, fell back on the pillow. His lips ceased
to move and the rolling eyes became quiet and stared upwards with an intense
and steady persistence. Donkin was surprised; he sat suddenly on the chest,
and looked down, exhausted and gloomy. After a moment he began to mutter
to himself, &amp;lsquo;Die, you beggar -- die. Somebody'll come in.....I
wish I was drunk....Ten days....Hoysters....&amp;rsquo; He looked up and
spoke louder. &amp;lsquo;No....no more for yer....no more bloomin' gals
that cook hoysters....Who's yer? Hit's my turn now.... I wish I was drunk;
I would soon giv' you a leg up haloft. That's where y er will go. Feet
first, through a port....Splash! Never see yer hany more. Hoverboard! Good
'nuff fur yer.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy's head moved slightly and he turned his eyes to Donkin's
face; a gaze unbelieving, desolated and appealing, of a child frightened
by the menace of being shut up alone in the dark. Donkin observed him from
the chest with hopeful eyes; then without rising he tried the lid. Locked.
&amp;lsquo;I wish I was drunk.&amp;rsquo; he muttered and getting up listened
anxiously to the distant sound of footsteps on the deck. They approached
-- ceased. Some one yawned interminably just outside the door, and the
footsteps went away shuffling lazily. Donkin's fluttering heart eased its
pace, and when he looked towards the bunk again Jimmy was staring as before
at the white beam. -- &amp;lsquo;'Ow d'yer feel now?&amp;rsquo; he asked.
-- &amp;lsquo;Bad,&amp;rsquo; breathed out Jimmy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin sat down patient and purposeful. Every half-hour
the bells spoke to one another ringing along the whole length of the ship.
Jimmy's respiration was so rapid that it couldn't be counted, so faint
that it couldn't be heard. His eyes were terrified as though he had been
looking at unspeakable horrors; and by his face one could see that he was
thinking of abominable things. Suddenly with an incredibly strong and heart-breaking
voice he sobbed out:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Overboard!....I!....My God!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin writhed a little on the box. He looked unwillingly.
Jimmy was mute. His two long bony hands smoothed the blanket upwards, as
though he had wished to gather it all up under his chin. A tear, a big
solitary tear, escaped from the corner of his eye and, without touching
the hollow cheek, fell on the pillow, his throat rattled faintly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Donkin, watching the end of that hateful nigger, felt
the anguishing grasp of a great sorrow on his heart at the thought that
he himself, some day, would have to go through it all -- just like this
-- perhaps! His eyes became moist. &amp;lsquo;Poor beggar,&amp;rsquo; he
murmured. The night seemed to go by in a flash; it seemed to him he could
hear the irremediable rush of precious minutes. How long would this blooming
affair last? Too long surely. No luck. He could not restrain himself. He
got up and approached the bunk. Wait did not stir. Only his eyes appeared
alive and his hands continued their smoothing movement with a horrible
and tireless industry. Donkin bent over.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Jimmy,&amp;rsquo; he called low. There was no
answer, but the rattle stopped. &amp;lsquo;D'yer see me?&amp;rsquo; he
asked trembling. Jimmy's chest heaved. Donkin, looking away, bent his ear
to Jimmy's lips and heard a sound like the rustle of a single dry leaf
driven along the smooth sand of a beach. It shaped itself.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Light....the lamp....and....go.&amp;rsquo; breathed
out Wait.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin, instinctively, glanced over his shoulder at the
blazing flame; then, still looking away, felt under the pillow for a key.
he got it at once and for the next few minutes was shakily but swiftly
busy about the box. when he got up, his face -- for the fist time in his
life -- had a pink flush -- perhaps of triumph.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He slipped the key under the pillow again, avoiding to
glance at Jimmy, who had not moved. He turned his back squarely from the
bunk and started to the door as though he were going to walk a mile. At
his second stride he had his nose against it. He clutched

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 115</TT>

<P>the handle cautiously, but at that moment he received the irresistible
impression of something happening behind his back. He spun round as though
he had been tapped on the shoulder. He was just in time to see Jimmy's
eyes blaze up and go out at once like two lamps overturned together by
a sweeping blow. Something resembling a scarlet thread hung down his chin
out of t he corner of his lips -- and he had ceased to breathe.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin closed the door behind him gently but firmly. Sleeping
men, huddled under jackets, made on the lighted deck shapeless dark mounds
that had the appearance of neglected graves. Nothing had been done all
through the night and he hadn't been missed. He stood motionless and perfectly
astounded to find the world outside as he had left it; there was the sea,
the ship -- sleeping men; and he wondered absurdly at it, as though he
had expected to find the men dead, familiar things gone for ever; as though,
like a wanderer returning after many years, he had expected to see bewildering
changes. He shuddered a little in the penetrating freshness of the air,
and hugged himself forlornly. The declining moon drooped sadly in the western
board as if withered by the cold touch of a pale dawn. The ship slept.
And the immortal sea stretched away, immense and hazy, like the image of
life with a glittering surface and lightless depths; promising, empty inspiring
-- terrible. Donkin gave it a defiant glance and slunk off noiselessly
as if judged and cast out by the august silence of its might.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy's death, after all, came as a tremendous surprise.
We did not know till then how much faith we had put in his delusions. We
had taken his chances of life so much at his own valuation that his death,
like the death of an old belief shook the foundations of our society. A
common bond was gone; the strong, effective and respectable bond of a sentimental
lie. All that day we mooned at our work, with suspicious looks and a disabused
air. In our hearts we thought that in the matter of his departure Jimmy
had acted in a perverse and unfriendly manner. He didn't back us up, as
a shipmate should. In going he took away with himself the gloomy and solemn
shadow in which our folly had posed, with human satisfaction, as a tender
arbiter of fate. And now we saw it was no

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 116</TT>

<P>such thing. It was just common foolishness; a silly and ineffectual
meddling with issues of majestic import -- that is, if Podmore was right.
Perhaps he was? Doubt survived Jimmy; and, like a community of banded criminals
disintegrated by a touch of grace, we were profoundly scandalised with
each other. Men spoke unkindly to their best chums. Others refused to speak
at all. Singleton only was not surprised. &amp;lsquo;Dead -- is he? Of
course,&amp;rsquo; he said, pointing at the island right abeam: for the
calm still held the ship spell-bound within sight of Flores. Dead -- of
course. <I>He</I> wasn't surprised. Here was the land, and there, on the
forehatch and waiting for the sailmaker -- there was that corpse. Cause
and effect. And for the fist time that voyage, the old seaman became quite
cheery and garrulous, explaining and illustrating from the stores of experience
how, in sickness, the sight of an island (even a very small one) is generally
more fatal than the view of a continent. But he couldn't explain why.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy was to be buried at five, and it was a long day till
then -- a day of mental disquiet and even of physical disturbance. We took
no interest in our work and, very properly, were rebuked for it. This,
in our constant state of hungry irritation, was exasperating. Donkin worked
with his brow bound in a dirty rag, and looked so ghastly that Mr. Baker
was touched with compassion at the sight of this plucky suffering. -- &amp;lsquo;Ough!
You, Donkin! Put down your work and go lay-up this watch. You look ill.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Hi ham, sir -- in my 'ead,&amp;rsquo; he said in a subdued
voice, and vanished speedily. This annoyed many, and they thought the mate
&amp;lsquo;bloomin' soft to-day.&amp;rsquo; Captain Allistoun could be
seen on the poop watching the sky cloud over from the south-west, and it
soon got to be known about the decks that the barometer had begun to fall
in the night and that a breeze might be expected before long. This, by
a subtle association of ideas, led to violent quarrelling as to the exact
moment of Jimmy's death. Was it before or after &amp;lsquo;that 'ere glass
started down&amp;rsquo;? It was impossible to know and it caused much contemptuous
growling at one another. All of a sudden there was a great tumult forward.
Pacific Knowles and good-tempered Davies had come to blows over it. The
watch below interfered with spirit, and for ten minutes there was a noisy
scrimmage round the hatch, where, in the balancing shade of the sails,
Jimmy's body, wrapped

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 117</TT>

<P>up in a white blanket, was watched over by the sorrowful Belfast, who,
in his desolation, disdained the fray. When the noise had ceased, and the
passions had calmed into surly silence, he stood up at the head of the
swathed body, and lifting both arms on high, cried with pained indignation:
-- &amp;lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of your-selves!....&amp;rsquo; We
were.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Belfast took his bereavement very hard. He gave proofs
of unextinguishable devotion. It was he, and no other man, who would help
the sailmaker to prepare what was left of Jimmy for a solemn surrender
to the insatiable sea. He arranged the weights carefully at the feet; two
holystones, an old anchor-shackle without its pin, some broken links of
a worn-out stream cable. He arranged them this way, then that. &amp;lsquo;Bless
my soul! you aren't afraid he will chafe his heel?&amp;rsquo; said the
sailmaker, who hated the job. He pushed the needle, puffing furiously,
with his head in a cloud of tobacco smoke; he turned the flaps over, pulled
at the stitches, stretched the canvas. -- &amp;lsquo;Lift his shoulders....Pull
to you a bit....So -- o -- o -- . Steady.&amp;rsquo; Belfast obeyed, pulled,
lifted, overcome with sorrow, dropping tears on the tarred twine. -- &amp;lsquo;Don't
you drag the canvas too taut over his poor face, Sails,&amp;rsquo; he entreated
tearfully. -- &amp;lsquo;What are you fashing yourself for? He will be
comfortable enough,&amp;rsquo; assured the sailmaker, cutting the thread
after the last stitch, that came about the middle of Jimmy's forehead.
He rolled up the remaining canvas, put away the needles. &amp;lsquo;What
makes you take on so?&amp;rsquo; he asked. Belfast looked down at the long
package of grey sailcloth. -- &amp;lsquo;I pulled him out,&amp;rsquo; he
whispered, &amp;lsquo;and he did not want to go. If I had sat up with him
last night he would have kept alive for me....but something made me tired.&amp;rsquo;
The sailmaker took vigorous draws at his pipe and mumbled: -- &amp;lsquo;When
I....West India Station....In the <I>Blanche</I> frigate....Yellow Jack....sewed
in twenty men a day....Portsmouth -- Devonport men -- townies -- knew their
fathers, mothers -- sisters -- the whole boiling of 'em. Thought nothing
of it. And these niggers like this one -- you don't know where it comes
from. Got nobody. No use to nobody. Who will miss him?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I
do -- I pulled him out,&amp;rsquo; mourned Belfast dismally.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On two planks nailed together, and apparently resigned
and still under the folds of the Union Jack with a white border, James
Wait, carried aft by four men, was deposited slowly, with his feet pointing
at an open port. A swell had set in from the westward, and following on
the roll of the ship, the red ensign, at half-mast, darted out and collapsed
again on the grey sky, like a tongue of flickering fire; Charley tolled
the bell; and at every swing to starboard the whole vast semi-circle of
steely waters visible on that side seemed to come up with a rush to the
edge of the port, as if impatient to get at our Jimmy. Every one was there
but Donkin, who was too ill to come; the Captain and Mr. Creighton stood
bareheaded on the break of the poop; Mr. Baker, directed by the master,
who had said to him gravely: -- &amp;lsquo;You know more about the prayer
book than I do,&amp;rsquo; came out of the cabin door quickly and a little
embarrassed. All the caps went off. He began to read in a low tone, and
with his usual harmlessly menacing utterance, as though he had been for
the last time reproving confidentially that dead seaman at his feet. The
men listened in scattered groups; they leaned on the fife rail, gazing
on the deck; they held their chins in their hands thoughtfully, or, with
crossed arms and one knee slightly bent, hung their heads in an attitude
of upright meditation. Wamibo dreamed. Mr. Baker read on, grunting reverently
at the turn of every page. The words, missing the unsteady hearts of men,
rolled out to wander without a home upon the heartless sea; and James Wait,
silenced forever, lay uncritical and passive under the hoarse murmur of
despair and hopes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two men made ready and waited for those words that send
so many of our brothers to their last plunge. Mr. Baker began the last
passage. &amp;lsquo;Stand by.&amp;rsquo; muttered the boatswain. Mr. Baker
read out:&amp;lsquo; To the deep,&amp;rsquo; and paused. The men lifted
the inboard end of the planks, the boatswain snatched off the Union Jack,
and James Wait did not move. -- &amp;lsquo;Higher,&amp;rsquo; muttered
the boatswain angrily. All the heads were raised; every man stirred uneasily,
but James Wait gave no sign of going. In death and swathed up for all eternity,
he yet seemed to hang on to the ship with the grip of an undying fear.
&amp;lsquo;Higher! Lift!&amp;rsquo; whispered the boatswain fiercely. --
&amp;lsquo;He won't go,&amp;rsquo; stammered one of the men shakily, and
both appeared ready to drop everything. Mr. Baker waited, burying his face
in the book, and shuffling his feet nervously. All the men looked profoundly
disturbed, from their midst a faint humming noise spread out --

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 119</TT>

<P>growing louder.....&amp;lsquo;Jimmy!&amp;rsquo; cried Belfast in a wailing
tone, and there was a second of shuddering dismay.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Jimmy, be a man!&amp;rsquo; he shrieked passionately.
Every mouth was wide open, not an eyelid winked. He stared wildly, twitching
all over; he bent his body forward like a man peering at an horror. &amp;lsquo;Go,
Jimmy! -- Jimmy, go! Go!&amp;rsquo; His fingers touched the head of the
body and the grey package started reluctantly to, all at once, whizz off
the lifted planks with the suddenness of a flash of lightning. The crowd
stepped forward like one man; a deep Ah -- h -- h! came out vibrating from
the broad chests. The ship rolled as if relieved of an unfair burden; the
sails flapped. Belfast, supported by Archie, gasped hysterically; and Charley,
who anxious to see Jimmy's last dive, leaped headlong on the rail, was
too late to see anything but the faint circle of a vanishing ripple.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker, perspiring abundantly, read out the last prayer
in a deep rumour of excited men and fluttering sails. &amp;lsquo;Amen!&amp;rsquo;
he said in an unsteady growl, and closed the book.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Square the yards!&amp;rsquo; thundered a voice
above his head. All hands gave a jump; one or two dropped their caps; Mr.
Baker looked up surprised. The master, standing on the break of the poop,
pointed to the westward. &amp;lsquo;Breeze coming,&amp;rsquo; he said,
&amp;lsquo;square the yards. Look alive, men!&amp;rsquo; Mr. Baker crammed
the book hurriedly into his pocket. -- &amp;lsquo;Forward there -- let
go the foretack!&amp;rsquo; he hailed joy fully bareheaded and brisk; &amp;lsquo;Square
the foreyard, you port-watch!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Fair wind -- fair
wind,&amp;rsquo; muttered the men going to the braces. -- &amp;lsquo;What
did I tell you?&amp;rsquo; mumbled old Singleton, flinging down coil after
coil with hasty energy; &amp;lsquo;I knowed it! -- he's gone, and here
it comes.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It came with the sound of a lofty and powerful sigh. The
sails filled, the ship gathered way, and the waking sea began to murmur
sleepily of home to the ears of men.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, while the ship rushed foaming to the Northward
before a freshening gale, the boatswain unbosomed himself to the petty
officers' berth: -- &amp;lsquo;The chap was nothing but trouble,&amp;rsquo;
he said, &amp;lsquo;from the moment he came aboard -- d'ye remember --
that night in Bombay? Been bullying all that softy crowd -- cheeked the
old man -- we had to go fooling all over a half-drowned ship to save

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 120</TT>

<P>him. Dam' nigh a mutiny all for him -- and now the mate abused me like
a pickpocket for forgetting to dab a lump of grease on them planks. So
I did, but you ought to have known better too, than to leave a nail sticking
up -- hey, Chips?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;And you ought to have known better
than to chuck all my tools overboard for 'im, like a skeary greenhorn,&amp;rsquo;
retorted the morose carpenter. &amp;lsquo;Well -- he's gone after 'em now,&amp;rsquo;
he added in an unforgiving tone. &amp;lsquo;On the China Station, I remember
once, the Admiral he says to me....&amp;rsquo; began the sailmaker.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A week afterwards the <I>Narcissus</I> entered the chops
of the Channel.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under white wings she skimmed low over the blue sea like
a great tired bird speeding to its nest. The clouds raced with her mastheads;
they rose astern enormous and white, soared to the zenith, flew past, and
falling down the wide curve of the sky seemed to dash headlong into the
sea -- the clouds swifter than the ship, more free, but without a home.
The coast to welcome her stepped out of space into the sunshine. The lofty
headlands trod masterfully into the sea; the wide bays smiled in the light;
the shadows of homeless clouds ran along the sunny plains, leaped over
valleys, without a check darted up the hills, rolled down the slopes; and
the sunshine pursued them with patches of running brightness. On the brows
of dark cliffs white lighthouses shone in pillars of light. The Channel
glittered like a blue mantle shot with gold and starred by the silver of
the capping seas. The <I>Narcissus</I> rushed past the headlands and the
bays. Outward-bound vessels crossed her track, lying over, and with their
masts stripped for a slogging fight with the hard sou'wester. And, inshore,
a string of smoking steamboats waddled, hugging the coast, like migrating
and amphibious monsters, distrustful of the restless waves.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At night the headlands retreated, the bays advanced into
one unbroken line of gloom. The lights of the earth mingled with the lights
of heaven; and above the tossing lanterns of a trawling fleet a great lighthouse
shone steadily, such as an enormous riding light burning above a vessel
of fabulous dimensions Below its steady glow, the coast, stretching away
straight and black, resembled the high side of an indestructible craft
riding motionless upon the immortal and unresting sea. The dark land lay
alone in the midst

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 121</TT>

<P>of waters, like a mighty ship bestarred with vigilant lights -- a ship
carrying the burden of millions of lives -- a ship freighted with dross
and with jewels, with gold and with steel. She towered up immense and strong,
guarding priceless traditions and untold suffering, sheltering glorious
memories and base forgetfulness, ignoble virtues and splendid transgressions.
A great ship! For ages had the ocean battered in vain her enduring sides;
she was there when the was vaster and darker, when the sea was great and
mysterious, and ready to surrender the prize of fame to audacious men.
A ship mother of fleets and nations! The great flagship of the race; stronger
than the storms! and anchored in the open sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>Narcissus</I>, heeling over to off-shore gusts,
rounded the South Foreland, passed through the Downs, and, in tow, entered
the river. Shorn of the glory of her white wings, she wound obediently
after the tug through the maze of invisible channels. As she passed them
the red-painted light-vessels, swung at their moorings seemed for an instant
to sail with great speed in the rush of tide, and the next moment were
left hopelessly behind. The big buoys on the tails of banks slipped past
her sides very low, and, dropping in her wake, tugged at their chains like
fierce watch-dogs. The reach narrowed; from both sides the land approached
the ship. She went steadily up the river. On the riverside slopes the houses
appeared in groups -- seemed to stream down the declivities at a run to
see her pass, and, checked by the mud of the foreshore, crowded on the
banks. Further on, the tall factory chimneys appeared in insolent bands
and watched her go by, like a straggling crowd of slim giants swaggering
and upright under the black plummets of smoke cavalierly aslant. She swept
round the bends; an impure breeze shrieked a welcome between her stripped
spars; and the land, closing in, stepped between the ship and the sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A low cloud hung before her -- a great opalescent and tremulous
cloud, that seemed to rise from the steaming brows of millions of men.
Long drifts of smoky vapours soiled it with livid trails; it throbbed to
the beat of millions of hearts, and from it came an immense and lamentable
murmur -- the murmur of millions of lips praying, cursing, sighing, jeering
-- the undying murmur of folly, regret, and hope exhaled by the crowds
of the anxious earth. The <I>Narcissus</I> entered the cloud; the shadows
deepened; on all sides

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 122</TT>

<P>there was the clang of iron, the sound of mighty blows, shrieks, yells.
Black barges drifted stealthily on the murky stream. A mad jumble of begrimed
walls loomed up vaguely in the smoke, bewildering and mournful, like a
vision of disaster. The tugs, panting furiously, backed and filled in the
stream, to hold the ship steady at the dock-gates; from her bows two lines
went through the air whistling, and struck at the land viciously, like
a pair of snakes. A bridge broke in two before her, as if by enchantment;
big hydraulic capstans began to turn all by themselves, as though animated
by a mysterious and unholy spell. She moved through a narrow lane of water
between two low walls of granite, and men with check-ropes in their hands
kept pace with her, walking on the broad flagstones. A group waited impatiently
on each side of the vanished bridge: rough heavy men in caps; sallow-faced
men in high hats; two bareheaded women; ragged children, fascinated and
with wide eyes. A cart coming at a jerky trot pulled up sharply. One of
the women screamed at the silent ship -- &amp;lsquo;Hallo, Jack!&amp;rsquo;
without looking at any one in particular, and all hands looked at her from
the forecastle head. -- &amp;lsquo;Stand clear! Stand clear of that rope!&amp;rsquo;
cried the dockmen, bending over stone posts. The crowd murmured, stamped
where they stood. -- &amp;lsquo;Let go your quarter-checks! Let go! sang
out a ruddy-faced old man on the quay. The ropes splashed heavily falling
in the water, and the <I>Narcissus</I> entered the dock.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The stony shores ran away right and left in straight lines,
enclosing a sombre and rectangular pool. brick walls rose high above the
water -- soulless walls, staring through hundreds of windows as troubled
and dull as the eyes of over-fed brutes. At their base monstrous iron cranes
crouched, with chains hanging from their long necks, balancing cruel-looking
hooks over the decks of lifeless ships. A noise of wheels rolling over
stones, the thump of heavy things falling, the racket of feverish winches,
the grinding of strained chains, floated on the air. Between high buildings
the dust of all the continents soared in short flights; and a penetrating
smell of perfumes and dirt, of spices and hides, of things costly and of
things filthy, pervaded the space, made for it an atmosphere precious and
disgusting. The <I>Narcissus</I> came gently into her berth; the shadows
of soulless walls fell upon her, the dust of all the continents

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 123</TT>

<P>leaped upon her deck, and a swarm of strange men, clambering up her
sides, took possession of her in the name of the sordid earth. She had
ceased to live.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A toff in a black coat and high hat scrambled with agility,
came up to the second mate, shook hands, and said: -- &amp;lsquo;Hallo,
Herbert.&amp;rsquo; It was his brother. A lady appeared suddenly. A real
lady, in a black dress and with a parasol. She looked extremely elegant
in the midst of us, and as strange as if she had fallen there from the
sky. Mr. Baker touched his cap to her. It was the master's wife. And very
soon the Captain, dressed very smartly and in a white shirt, went with
her over the side. We didn't recognise him at all till, turning on the
quay, he called to Mr. Baker: -- &amp;lsquo;Remember to wind up the chronometers
to-morrow morning.&amp;rsquo; An underhand lot of seedy-looking chaps with
shifty eyes wandered in and out of the forecastle looking for a job --
they said -- &amp;lsquo;More likely for something to steal,&amp;rsquo;
commented Knowles cheerfully. Poor beggars. Who cared? Weren't we home!
But Mr. Baker went for one of them who had given him some cheek, and we
were delighted. Everything was delightful -- &amp;lsquo;I've finished aft,
sir,&amp;rsquo; called out Mr. Creighton. -- &amp;lsquo;No water in the
well, sir,&amp;rsquo; reported for the last time t he carpenter, sounding-rod
in hand. Mr. Baker glanced along the decks at the expectant groups of men,
glanced aloft at the yards. -- &amp;lsquo;Ough! That will do, men.&amp;rsquo;
he grunted. The groups broke up. The voyage was ended.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolled-up beds went flying over the rail; lashed chests
went sliding along the gangway -- mighty few of both at that. &amp;lsquo;The
rest is having a cruise off the Cape,&amp;rsquo; explained Knowles enigmatically
to a dock-loafer with whom he had struck a sudden friendship. Men ran,
calling to one another, hailing utter strangers to &amp;lsquo;lend a hand
with the dunnage,&amp;rsquo; then sudden decorum approached the mate to
shake hands before going ashore. -- &amp;lsquo;Good-bye, sir,&amp;rsquo;
they repeated in various tones. Mr. Baker grasped hard palms, grunted in
a friendly manner at every one, his eyes twinkled. -- &amp;lsquo;Take care
of your money, Knowles. Ough! Soon get a nice wife if you do.&amp;rsquo;
The lame man was delighted. -- &amp;lsquo;Good-bye, sir,&amp;rsquo; said
Belfast with emotion, wringing the mate's hand, and looked up with swimming
eyes. &amp;lsquo;I thought I would take 'im ashore with me,&amp;rsquo;
he went on plaintively. Mr. Baker did not understand, but said

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 124</TT>

<P>kindly: -- &amp;lsquo;Take care of yourself, Craik,&amp;rsquo; and the
bereaved Belfast went over the rail mourning and alone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker in the sudden peace of the ship moved about solitary
and grunting, trying door handles peering into dark places, never done
-- a model chief mate! No one waited for him ashore. Mother dead; father
and two brothers, Yarmouth fishermen, drowned together on the Dogger Bank;
sister married and unfriendly. Quite a lady. Married to the leading tailor
of a little town, and its leading politician, who did not think his sailor
brother-in-law quite respectable enough for him. Quite a lady, quite a
lady, he thought, sitting down for a moment's rest on the quarter-hatch.
Time enough to go ashore and get a bite, and sup, and a bed somewhere.
He didn't like to part with the ship. No one to think about then. The darkness
of a misty evening fell, cold and damp, upon the deserted deck; and Mr.
Baker sat smoking, thinking of all the successive ships to whom through
many years he had given the best of a seaman's care. And never a command
in sight. Not once! -- &amp;lsquo;I haven't somehow the cut of a skipper
about me,&amp;rsquo; he meditated placidly, while the shipkeeper (who had
taken possession of the galley), a wizened old man with bleared eyes, cursed
him, in whispers for &amp;lsquo;hanging about so.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Now
Creighton,&amp;rsquo; he pursued the unenvious train of thought. &amp;lsquo;quite
a gentleman..... swell friends....will get on. Fine young fellow.....a
little more experience.&amp;rsquo; He got up and shook himself. &amp;lsquo;I'll
be back first thing to-morrow morning for the hatches. Don't you let them
touch anything before I come, shipkeeper,&amp;rsquo; he called out. Then,
at last, he also went ashore -- a model chief mate!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The men scattered by the dissolving contract of the land
came together once more in the shipping office. -- &amp;lsquo;The <I>Narcissus</I>
pays off,&amp;rsquo; shouted outside a glazed door a brass-bound old fellow
with a crown and the capitals B. T. on his cap. A lot trooped in at once
but many were late. The room was large, white-washed, and bare; a counter
surmounted by a brass-wire grating fenced off a third of the dusty space,
and behind the grating a pasty-faced clerk, with his hair parted in the
middle, had the quick, glittering eyes and the vivacious, jerky movements
of a caged bird. Poor Captain Allistoun also in there, and sitting before
a little table with piles of gold and notes on it, appeared subdued by
his captivity. Another Board of

<P>Trade bird was perching on a high stool near the door; an old bird that
did not mind the chaff of elated sailors. The crew of the <I>Narcissus</I>,
broken up into knots, pushed in the corners. They had new shore togs, smart
jackets that looked as if they had been shaped with an axe, glossy trousers
that seemed made of crumpled sheet-iron, collarless flannel shirts, shiny
new boots. They tapped on shoulders, button-holed one another, slapped
their thighs, stamped, with bursts of subdued laughter. Most had clean
radiant faces; only one or two were dishevelled and sad; the two young
Norwegians looked tidy, meek, and altogether of a promising material for
the kind ladies that patronize the Scandinavian Home. Wamibo, still in
his working clothes, dreamed, upright and burly in the middle of the room,
and, when Archie came in, woke up for a smile. But the wide-awake clerk
called out a name, and the paying-off business began.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One by one they came up to the pay-table to get the wages
of their glorious and obscure toil. They swept the money with care into
broad palms, rammed it trustfully into trousers pockets, or, turning their
backs on the table, reckoned with difficulty in the hollow of their stiff
hands. -- &amp;lsquo;Money right? Sign the release. There -- there,&amp;rsquo;
repeated the clerk, impatiently. &amp;lsquo;How stupid those sailors are!&amp;rsquo;
he thought. Singleton came up, venerable -- and uncertain as to daylight;
brown drops of tobacco juice maculated his white beard; his hands, that
never hesitated in the great light of the open sea, could hardly find the
small pile of gold in the profound darkness of the shore. &amp;lsquo;Can't
write?&amp;rsquo; said the clerk, shocked. &amp;lsquo;Make a mark, then.&amp;rsquo;
Singleton painfully sketched in a heavy cross, blotted the page. &amp;lsquo;What
a disgusting old brute,&amp;rsquo; muttered the clerk. Somebody opened
the door for him, and the patriarchal seaman passed through unsteadily,
without as much as a glance at any of us.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Archie had a pocket-book. he was chaffed. Belfast, who
looked wild, as though he had already luffed up through a public-house
or two, gave signs of emotion and wanted to speak to Captain privately.
The master was surprised. They spoke through the wires, and we could hear
the Captain saying: -- &amp;lsquo;I've given it up to the Board of Trade.&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;I should 've liked to get something of his,&amp;rsquo; mumbled
Belfast. &amp;lsquo;But you can't, my man. It's given up, locked and sealed,
to the Marine Office,&amp;rsquo; expostulated the master; and Belfast stood
back, with drooping mouth and troubled eyes. In a pause of the business
we heard the master and the clerk talking. We caught &amp;lsquo;James Wait
-- deceased -- found no papers of any kind -- no relations -- no trace
-- the office must hold his wages then.&amp;rsquo; Donkin entered. He seemed
out of breath, was grave, full of business. He went straight to the desk,
talked with animation to the clerk, who thought him an intelligent man.
They discussed the account, dropping h's against one another as if for
a wager -- very friendly. Captain Allistoun paid. &amp;lsquo;I give you
a bad discharge,&amp;rsquo; he said, quietly. Donkin raised his voice:
-- &amp;lsquo;I don't want your bloomin' discharge -- keep it. I'm goin'
ter 'ave a job hashore.&amp;rsquo; He turned to us. &amp;lsquo;No more
bloomin' sea fur me,&amp;rsquo; he said, aloud. All looked at him. He had
better clothes, had an easy air, appeared more at home than any of us;
he stared with assurance, enjoying the effect of his declaration. &amp;lsquo;Yuss.
I 'ave friends well hoff. That's more'n yer got. But I ham a man. Yer shipmates
for all that. Who's comin' fur a drink?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No one moved. There was a silence; a silence of blank faces
and stony looks. He waited a moment, smiled bitterly, and went to the door.
There he faced round once more. &amp;lsquo;Yer won't? Yer bloomin' lot
of 'ypocrites. No? What 'ave I done to yer? Did I bully yer? Did I hurt
yer? Did I?.... Yer won't drink?....No!....Then may yer die of thirst,
hevery mother's son of yer! Not one of yer 'as the sperrit of a bug. Ye're
the scum of the world. Work and starve!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went out, and slammed the door with such violence that
the old Board of Trade bird nearly fell off his perch.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;He's mad,&amp;rsquo; said Archie. &amp;lsquo;No!
No! He's drunk,&amp;rsquo; insisted Belfast, lurching about, and in a maudlin
tone. Captain Allistoun sat smiling thoughtfully at the cleared pay-table.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, on Tower Hill, they blinked, hesitated clumsily,
as if blinded by the strange quality of the hazy light, as if discomposed
by the view of so many men; and they who could hear one another in the
howl of gales seemed deafened and distracted by the dull roar of the busy
earth. -- &amp;lsquo;To the Black Horse! To the Black Horse!&amp;rsquo;
cried some. &amp;lsquo;Let us have a drink together before we part.&amp;rsquo;
They crossed the road, clinging to one another. Only Charlie and Belfast

<P>wandered off alone. As I came up I saw a red-faced, blowsy woman, in
a grey shawl, and with dusty, fluffy hair, fall on Charley's neck. It was
his mother. She slobbered over him: -- &amp;lsquo;O, my boy! My boy!&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Leggo of me,&amp;rsquo; said Charley, &amp;lsquo;Leggo, mother!&amp;rsquo;
I was passing him at the time, and over the untidy head of the blubbering
woman he gave me a humorous smile and a glance ironic, courageous, and
profound, that seemed to put all my knowledge of life to shame. I nodded
and passed on, but heard him say again, good-naturedly: -- &amp;lsquo;If
you leggo of me this minyt -- ye shall 'ave a bob for a drink out of my
pay.&amp;rsquo; In the next few steps I came upon Belfast. He caught my
arm with tremulous enthusiasm. -- &amp;lsquo;I couldn't go wi' 'em,&amp;rsquo;
he stammered, indicating by a nod our noisy crowd, that drifted slowly
along the other sidewalk. &amp;lsquo;When I think of Jimmy.....Poor Jim!
When I think of him I have no heart for drink. You were his chum, too....but
I pulled him out....didn't I? Short wool he had....Yes. And I stole the
blooming pie.....He wouldn't go.....He wouldn't go for nobody.&amp;rsquo;
He burst into tears. &amp;lsquo;I never touched him -- never -- never --
&amp;rsquo; he sobbed. &amp;lsquo;He went for me like....like.... a lamb.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I disengaged myself gently. Belfast's crying fits generally
ended in a fight with some one, and I wasn't anxious to stand the brunt
of his inconsolable sorrow. Moreover, two bulky policemen stood near by,
looking at us with a disapproving and incorruptible gaze. -- &amp;lsquo;So
long!&amp;rsquo; I said, and went off.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the corner I stopped to take my last look at the
crew of the <I>Narcissus</I>. They were swaying, irresolute and noisy on
the broad flagstones before the Mint. They were bound for the Black Horse,
where men, in fur caps, with brutal faces and in shirt sleeves, dispense
out of varnished barrels the illusions of strength, mirth, happiness; the
illusion of splendour and poetry of life, to the paid-off crews of southern-going
ships. From afar I saw them discoursing, with jovial eyes and clumsy gestures,
while the sea of life thundered into their ears ceaseless and unheeded.
And swaying about there on the white stones, surrounded by the hurry and
clamour of men, they appeared to be creatures of another kind -- lost,
alone, forgetful, and doomed; they were like cast aways, like reckless
and joyous castaways, like mad castaways making merry in the storm and
upon an insecure ledge of a treacherous rock.

<P>The roar of the town resembled the roar of topping breakers, merciless
and strong, with a loud voice and cruel purpose; but overhead the clouds
broke; a flood of sunshine streamed down the walls of grimy houses. The
dark knot of seamen drifted in sunshine. To the left of them the trees
in Tower Gardens sighed, the stones of the Tower gleaming, seemed to stir
in the play of light, as if remembering suddenly all the great joys and
sorrows of the past, the fighting prototypes of these men; press-gangs;
mutinous cries; the wailing of women by the riverside, and the shouts of
men welcoming victories. The sunshine of heaven fell like a gift of grace
on the mud of the earth, on the remembering and mute stones, on greed,
selfishness; on the anxious faces of forgetful men. And to the right of
the dark group the stained front of the Mint, cleansed by the flood of
light, stood out for a moment, dazzling and white like a marble palace
in a fairy tale. The crew of the <I>Narcissus</I> drifted out of sight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I never saw them again. The sea took some, the steamers
took others, the graveyards of the earth will account for the rest. Singleton
has no doubt taken with him the long record of his faithful work into the
peaceful depths of an hospitable sea. And Donkin, who never did a decent
day's work in his life, no doubt earns his living by discoursing with filthy
eloquence upon the right of labour to live. So be it! Let the earth and
the sea each have its own.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A gone shipmate, like any other man, is gone for ever;
and I never saw one of them again. But at times the spring-flood of memory
sets with force up the dark River of the Nine Bends. Then on the waters
of the forlorn stream drifts a ship -- a shadowy ship manned by a crew
of Shades. They pass and make a sign, in a shadowy hall. Haven't we, together
and upon the immortal sea, wrung out a meaning from our sinful lives? Good-bye
brothers! You were a good crowd. As good a crowd as ever fisted with wild
cries the beating canvas of a heavy foresail; or tossing aloft, invisible
in the night, gave back yell for yell to a westerly gale.
