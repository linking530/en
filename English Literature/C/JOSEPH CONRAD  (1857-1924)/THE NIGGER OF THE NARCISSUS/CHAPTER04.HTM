&nbsp;&nbsp; On men reprieved by its disdainful mercy, the immortal sea
confers in its justice the full privilege of desired unrest. Through the
perfect wisdom of its grace they are not permitted to meditate at ease
upon the complicated and acrid savour of existence, lest they should remember
and, perchance, regret the reward of a cup of inspiring bitterness, tasted
so often, and so often withdrawn from before their stiffening but reluctant
lips. They must without pause justify their life to the eternal pity that
commands toil to be hard and unceasing, from sunrise to sunset, from sunset
to sunrise: till the weary succession of nights and days tainted by the
obstinate clamour of sages, demanding bliss and an empty heaven, is redeemed
at last by the vast silence of pain and labour, by the dumb fear and the
dumb courage of men obscure, forgetful, and enduring.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The master and Mr. Baker coming face to face stared for
a moment, with the intense and amazed looks of men meeting unexpectedly
after years of trouble. Their voices were gone, and they whispered desperately
at one another. -- &amp;lsquo;Any one missing?&amp;rsquo; asked Captain
Allistoun. -- &amp;lsquo;No, All there.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Anybody
hurt?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Only the second mate.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I
will look after him directly. We're lucky.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Very,&amp;rsquo;
articulated Mr. Baker, faintly. He gripped the rail and rolled bloodshot
eyes. The little grey man made an effort to raise his voice above a dull
mutter, and fixed his chief mate with a cold gaze, piercing like a dart.
-- &amp;lsquo;Get sail on the ship,&amp;rsquo;he said, speaking authoritatively,
and with an inflexible snap of his thin lips. &amp;lsquo;Get sail on her
as soon as you can. This is a fair wind. At once, sir -- Don't give the
men time to feel themselves. They will get done up and stiff, and we will
never....We must get her along now&amp;rsquo;...He reeled to a long heavy
roll; the rail dipped into the glancing hissing water. He caught a shroud,
swung helplessly against the mate....&amp;lsquo;now we have a fair wind
at last. -- Make -- sail.&amp;rsquo; His head rolled from shoulder to shoulder.
His eyelids began to beat rapidly. &amp;lsquo;And the pumps -- pumps, Mr.
Baker.&amp;rsquo; He peered as though the face within a foot of his eyes
had been half a mile off. &amp;lsquo;Keep the men on the move to -- to
get her along.&amp;rsquo; he mumbled in a drowsy tone, like a man going
off into a doze. He pulled himself together suddenly. &amp;lsquo;Mustn't
stand. Won't do,&amp;rsquo; he said with a painful attempt at a smile.
He let go his hold, and, propelled by the dip of the ship, ran aft unwillingly,
with small steps, till he brought up against the binnacle stand. Hanging
on there he looked up in an objectless manner at Singleton, who, unheeding
him, watched anxiously the end of the jib-boom -- &amp;lsquo;Steering gear
works all right?&amp;rsquo; he asked. There was a noise in the old seaman's
throat, as though the words had been rattling there together before they
could come out. -- &amp;lsquo;Steers....like a little boat,&amp;rsquo;
he said, at last, with hoarse tenderness, without giving the master as
much as half a glance -- then, watchfully, spun the wheel down, steadied,
flung it back again. Captain Allistoun tore himself away from the delight
of leaning against the binnacle, and began to walk the poop, swaying and
reeling to preserve his balance.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The pump-rods, clanking, stamped in short jumps, while
the fly-wheels turned smoothly, with great speed, at the foot of the mainmast,
flinging back and forth with a regular impetuosity two limp clusters of
men clinging to the handles. They abandoned themselves, swaying from the
hip with twitching faces and stony eyes. The carpenter, sounding from time
to time, exclaimed mechanically:&amp;lsquo;Shake her up! Keep her going!&amp;rsquo;
Mr. Baker could not speak, but found his voice to shout; and under the
goad of his objurgations, men looked to the lashings, dragged out new sails;
and thinking themselves unable to move, carried heavy blocks

<P>aloft -- overhauled the gear. They went up the rigging with faltering
and desperate efforts. Their heads swam as they shifted their hold, stepped
blindly on the yards like men in the dark; or trusted themselves to the
first rope to hand with the negligence of exhausted strength. The narrow
escape from the falls did not disturb the languid beat of their hearts;
the roar of the seas seething far below them sounded continuous and faint
like an indistinct noise from another world; the wind filled their eyes
with tears, and with heavy gusts tried to push them off from where they
swayed in insecure positions. With streaming faces and blowing hair they
flew up and down between sky and water, bestriding the ends of yard-arms,
crouching on foot-ropes, embracing lifts to have their hands free, or standing
up against chain ties. Their thoughts floated vaguely between the desire
of rest and the desire of life, while their stiffened fingers cast off
head-earrings, fumbled for knives, or held with tenacious grip against
the violent shocks of beating canvas. They glared savagely at one another,
made frantic signs with one hand while they held their life in the other,
looked down on the narrow strip of flooded deck, shouted along to leeward:&amp;lsquo;
Light-to!&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Haul out!&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Make
fast!&amp;rsquo;. Their lips moved, their eyes started, furious and eager
with the desire to be understood, but the wind tossed their words unheard
upon the disturbed sea. In an unendurable and unending strain they worked
like men driven by a merciless dream to toil in an atmosphere of ice or
flame. They burnt and shivered in turns. Their eyeballs smarted as if in
the smoke of a conflagration; their heads were ready to burst with every
shout. Hard fingers seemed to grip their throats. At every roll they thought;
Now I must let go. It will shake us all off -- and thrown about aloft they
cried wildly: &amp;lsquo;Look out there -- catch the end.&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Reeve
clear&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Turn this block.....&amp;rsquo; They nodded
desperately; shook infuriated faces. &amp;lsquo;No! No! From down up.&amp;rsquo;
They seemed to hate one another with a deadly hate. The longing to be done
with it all gnawed at their breasts, and the wish to do things well was
a burning pain. They cursed their fate, contemned their life, and wasted
their breath in deadly imprecations upon one another. The sailmaker, with
his bald head bared, worked feverishly, forgetting his intimacy with so
many admirals. The boatswain, climbing up with marlinspikes and bunches
of spunyarn rovings, or kneeling

<P>on the yard and ready to take a turn with the midship-stop, had acute
and fleeting visions of his old woman and the youngsters in a moorland
village. Mr. Baker, feeling very weak, tottered here and there, grunting
and inflexible, like a man of iron. He waylaid those who, coming from aloft,
stood gasping for breath. He ordered, encouraged, scolded. &amp;lsquo;Now
then -- to the top mainsail now! Tally on to that gantline. Don't stand
about there!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Is there no rest for us?&amp;rsquo;
muttered voices. He spun round fiercely, with a sinking heart. -- &amp;lsquo;No!
No rest till the work is done. Work till you drop. That's what you're here
for.&amp;rsquo; A bowed seaman at his elbow gave a short laugh. -- &amp;lsquo;Do
or die,&amp;rsquo; he croaked bitterly, then spat into his broad palms,
swung up his long arms, and grasping the rope high above his head sent
out mournful, wailing cry for a pull all together. A sea boarded the quarter-deck
and sent the whole lot sprawling to leeward. Caps, handspikes floated.
Clenched hands, kicking legs, with here and there a spluttering face, stuck
out of the white hiss of foaming water. Mr. Baker, knocked down with the
rest, screamed -- &amp;lsquo;Don't let go that rope! Hold on to it! Hold!&amp;rsquo;And
sorely bruised by the brutal fling, they held on to it, as though it had
been the fortune of their life. The ship ran, rolling heavily, and the
topping crests glanced past port and starboard flashing their white heads.
Pumps were freed. Braces were rove. The three topsails and foresail were
set. She spurted faster over the water, outpacing the swift rush of waves.
The menacing thunder of distanced seas rose behind her -- filled the air
with the tremendous vibrations of its voice. And devastated, battered,
and wounded she drove foaming to the northward, as though inspired by the
courage of a high endeavour.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The forecastle was a place of damp desolation. They looked
at their dwelling with dismay. It was slimy, dripping; it hummed hollow
with the wind, and was strewn with shapeless wreckage like a half-tide
cavern in a rocky and exposed coast. Many had lost all they had in the
world, but most of the starboard watch had preserved their chests; thin
streams of water trickled out of them, however. The beds were soaked; the
blankets spread out and saved by some nail squashed under foot. They dragged
wet rags from evil-smelling corners, and, wringing the water our, recognised
their property. Some smiled stiffly. Others looked round blank and mute.

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 70</TT>

<P>There were cries of joy over old waistcoats, and groans of sorrow over
shapeless things found amongst the black splinters of smashed bed boards.
One lamp was discovered jammed under the bowsprit, Charley whimpered a
little. Knowles stumped here and there, sniffing, examining dark places
for salvage. He poured dirty water out of a boot, and was concerned to
find the owner. Those who, overwhelmed by their losses, sat on the forepeak
hatch, remained elbows on knees, and, with a fist against each cheek, disdained
to look up. He pushed it under their noses. &amp;lsquo;Here's a good boot.
Yours?&amp;rsquo; They snarled, &amp;lsquo;No -- get out.&amp;rsquo; One
snapped at him, &amp;lsquo;Take it the hell out of this.&amp;rsquo; He
seemed surprised. &amp;lsquo;Why? It's a good boot,&amp;rsquo; but remembering
suddenly that he had lost every stitch of his clothing, he dropped his
find and began to swear. In the dim light cursing voices clashed. A man
came in and, dropping his arms, stood still, repeating from the doorstep,
&amp;lsquo;Here's a bloomin' old go! Here's a bloomin' old go!&amp;rsquo;
A few rooted anxiously in flooded chests for tobacco. They breathed hard,
clamoured with heads down, &amp;lsquo;Look at that, Jack!&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Here!
Sam! Here's my shore-going rig spoilt for ever.&amp;rsquo; One blasphemed
tearfully holding up a pair of dripping trousers. No one looked at him.
The cat came out from somewhere. He had an ovation. They snatched him from
hand to hand, caressed him in a murmur of pet names. They wondered where
he had &amp;lsquo;weathered it out;&amp;rsquo; disputed about it. A squabbling
argument began. Two men came in with a bucket of fresh water, and all crowded
round it; but Tom, lean and mewing, came up with every hair astir and had
the first drink. A couple of men went aft for oil and biscuits.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in the yellow light and in the intervals of mopping
the deck they crunched hard bread, arranging to &amp;lsquo;worry through
somehow.&amp;rsquo; Men chummed as to beds. Turns were settled for wearing
boots and having the use of oilskin coats. They called one another &amp;lsquo;old
man&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;sonny&amp;rsquo; in cheery voices. Friendly
slaps resounded. Jokes were shouted. One or two stretched on the wet deck,
slept with heads pillowed on their bent arms, and several, sitting on the
hatch, smoked. Their weary faces appeared through a thin blue haze, pacified
and with sparkling eyes. The boatswain put his head through the door. &amp;lsquo;Relieve
the wheel. one of you&amp;rsquo; -- he shouted inside -- &amp;lsquo;it's
six. Blamme if that old Singleton hasn't been

<P>

<P><TT>Page 71</TT>

<P>there more'n thirty hours. You are a fine lot.&amp;rsquo; He slammed
the door again. &amp;lsquo;Mate's watch on deck,&amp;rsquo; said some one.
&amp;lsquo;Hey, Donkin, it's your relief!&amp;rsquo; shouted three or four
together. He had crawled into an empty bunk and on wet planks lay still.
&amp;lsquo;Donkin, your wheel.&amp;rsquo; He made no sound. &amp;lsquo;Donkin's
dead,&amp;rsquo; guffawed some one. &amp;lsquo;Sell 'is bloomin' clothes,&amp;rsquo;
shouted another. &amp;lsquo;Donkin, ifye don't go to the bloomin' wheel
they will sell your clothes -- d'ye hear?&amp;rsquo; jeered a third. He
groaned from his dark hole. He complained about pains in all his bones,
he whimpered pitifully. &amp;lsquo;He won't go,&amp;rsquo; exclaimed a
contemptuous voice, &amp;lsquo;your turn, Davies.&amp;rsquo; The young
seaman rose painfully squaring his shoulders. Donkin stuck his head out,
and it appeared in the yellow light, fragile and ghastly. &amp;lsquo;I
will giv' yer a pound of tobaccer,&amp;rsquo; he whined in a conciliating
voice, &amp;lsquo;so soon as I can draw it from haft. I will&amp;lsquo;I
will -- s'help me.....&amp;rsquo; Davies swung his arm backhanded and the
head vanished. &amp;lsquo;I'll go, he said, but you will pay for it.&amp;rsquo;
He walked unsteady but resolute in the door. &amp;lsquo;So I will,&amp;rsquo;
yelped Donkin, popping out behind him. &amp;lsquo;So I will -- s'elp me....three
bob they chawrge.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;You will pay my price....in fine
weather.&amp;rsquo; he shouted over his shoulder. One of the men unbuttoned
his wet coat rapidly, threw it at his head. &amp;lsquo;Here, Taffy -- take
that, you thief!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Thank you!&amp;rsquo; he cried from
the darkness above the swish of rolling water. He could be heard splashing;
a sea came on board with a thump. &amp;lsquo;He's got his bath already,&amp;rsquo;
remarked a grim shellback. &amp;lsquo;Aye, aye!&amp;rsquo; grunted the
others. Then, after a long silence, Wamibo made strange noises. &amp;lsquo;Hallo,
what's up with you?&amp;rsquo; said one grumpily. &amp;lsquo;He says he
would have gone for Davy,&amp;rsquo; explained Archie, who was the Finn's
interpreter generally. &amp;lsquo;I believe him!&amp;rsquo; cried voices....&amp;lsquo;Never
mind, Dutchy.... You'll do, muddle-head....Your turn will come soon enough....
You don't know when ye're well off.&amp;rsquo; They ceased, and all together
turned their faces to the door. Singleton stepped in, made two paces, and
stood swaying slightly. The sea hissed, flowed roaring past the bows, and
the forecastle trembled, full of a deep rumour; the lamp flared, swinging
like a pendulum. He looked with a dreamy and puzzled stare, as though he
could not distinguish the still men from their restless shadows. There
were awe-struck murmurs: -- &amp;lsquo;Hallo, hallo&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;How
does it look outside now, Singleton?&amp;rsquo; Those who sat

<P>

<P>on the hatch lifted their eyes in silence, and the next oldest seaman
in the ship (those two understood one another, though they hardly exchanged
three words in a day) gazed up at his friend attentively for a moment,
then taking a short clay pipe out of his mouth, offered it without a word.
Singleton put out his arm towards it, missed, staggered, and suddenly fell
forward, crashing down, stiff and headlong like an uprooted tree. There
was a swift rush. Men pushed, crying: -- &amp;lsquo;He's done!&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Turn
him over!&amp;rsquo;.... &amp;lsquo;Stand clear there!&amp;rsquo; Under
a crowd of startled faces bending over him he lay on his back, staring
upwards in a continuous and intolerable manner. In the breathless silence
of a general consternation, he said in a grating murmur: -- &amp;lsquo;I
am all right,&amp;rsquo; and clutched with his hands. They helped him up.
He mumbled despondently: -- &amp;lsquo;I am getting old....old.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Not you,&amp;rsquo; cried Belfast, with ready tact. Supported
on all sides, he hung his head. -- &amp;lsquo;Are you better?&amp;rsquo;
they asked. He glared at them from under his eyebrows with large black
eyes, spreading over his chest the bushy whiteness of a beard long and
thick. -- &amp;lsquo;Old! old!&amp;rsquo; he repeated sternly. Helped along,
he reached his bunk. There was in it a slimy soft heap of something that
smelt like does at dead low water a muddy foreshore. It was his soaked
straw bed. With a convulsive effort he pitched himself on it, and in the
darkness of the narrow place could be heard growling angrily, like an irritated
and savage animal uneasy in its den: -- &amp;lsquo;Bit of breeze....small
thing....can't stand up....old!&amp;rsquo; He slept at last. He breathed
heavily, high-booted, sou'wester on head, and his oilskin clothes rustled,
when with a deep sighing groan he turned over. men conversed about him
in quiet concerned whispers. &amp;lsquo;This will break 'im up&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Strong
as a horse&amp;rsquo;.... &amp;lsquo;Aye. But he ain't what he used to
be&amp;rsquo;.... In sad murmurs they gave him up. Yet at midnight he turned
out to duty as if nothing had been the matter, and answered to his name
with a mournful &amp;lsquo;Here!&amp;rsquo; He brooded alone more than
ever, in an impenetrable silence and with a saddened face. For many years
he had heard himself called &amp;lsquo;Old Singleton,&amp;rsquo; and had
serenely accepted the qualification, taking it as a tribute of respect
due to a man who through half a century had measured his strength against
the favours and the rages of the sea. He had never given a thought to his
mortal self. He lived unscathed, as though he had been indestructible,
surrendering to

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 73</TT>

<P>all the temptations, weathering many gales. He had panted in sunshine,
shivered in the cold; suffered hunger, thirst, debauch; passed through
many trials -- known all the furies. Old! It seemed to him he was broken
at last. And like a man bound treacherously while he sleeps, he woke up
fettered by the long chain of disregarded years. He had to take up at once
the burden of all his existence, and found it almost too heavy for his
strength. Old! He moved his arms, shook his head, felt his limbs. Getting
old.... and then? He looked upon the immortal sea with the awakened and
groping perception of its heartless might; he saw it unchanged, black and
foaming under the eternal scrutiny of the stares; he heard its impatient
voice calling for him out of a pitiless vastness full of unrest, of turmoil,
and of terror. He looked afar upon it, and he saw an immensity tormented
and blind, moaning and furious, that claimed all the days of his tenacious
life, and, when life was over, would claim the worn-out body of its slave.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the last of the breeze. It veered quickly, changed
to a black south-eastern and blew itself out, giving the ship a famous
shove to the northward into the joyous sunshine of the trade. Rapid and
white she ran homewards in a straight path, under a blue sky and upon the
plain of a blue sea. She carried Singleton's completed wisdom, Donkin's
delicate susceptibilities, and the conceited folly of us all. The hours
of ineffective turmoil were forgotten; the fear and anguish of these dark
moments were never mentioned in the glowing peace of fine days. Yet from
that time our life seemed to start afresh as though we had died and been
resuscitated. All the first part of the voyage, the Indian Ocean on the
other side of the Cape, all that was lost in a haze, like an ineradicable
suspicion of some previous existence. It had ended -- then there were blank
hours; a livid blur -- and again we lived! Singleton was possessed of sinister
truth; Mr. Creighton of a damaged leg; the cook of fame -- and shamefully
abused the opportunities of his distinction. Donkin had an added grievance.
He went about repeating with insistence: -- &amp;lsquo;'E said 'e would
brain me -- did you hear? They hare goin' to murder hus now for the least
little thing.&amp;rsquo; We began at last to think it was rather awful.
And we were conceited! We boasted our pluck, of our capacity foe work,
of our energy. We remembered honourable episodes: our devotion,

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 74</TT>

<P>our indomitable perseverance -- and were proud of them as though they
had been the outcome of our unaided impulses. We remembered our danger,
our toil -- and conveniently forgot our horrible scare. We decried our
officer -- who had done nothing -- and listened to the fascinating Donkin,
His care for our rights, his disinterested concern for our dignity, were
not discouraged by the invariable contumely of our words, by the disdain
of our looks. Our contempt for him was unbounded -- and we could unbounded
-- and we could not but listen with interest to that consummate artist.
He told us we were good men -- a &amp;lsquo;bloomin' condemned lot of good
men.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo; Who thanked us? Who took any notice of our
wrongs? Didn't we lead a &amp;lsquo;dorg's loife for two poun'ten a month?&amp;rsquo;
Did we think that miserable pay enough to compensate us for the risk to
our lives and for the loss of our clothes? &amp;lsquo;We've lost hevery
rag!&amp;rsquo; he cried. He made us forget that he, at any rate, had lost
nothing of his own. The younger men listened, thinking -- this 'ere Donkin's
a long-headed chap, though no kind of man, anyhow. The Scandinavians were
frightened at his audacities; Wamibo did not understand; and the older
seamen thoughtfully nodded their heads making the thin gold earrings glitter
in the fleshy lobes of hairy ears. Severe, sun-burnt faces were propped
meditatively on tattooed forearms. Veined, brown fists held in their grip
the dirty white clay of smoldering pipes. They listened, impenetrable,
broad-backed, with bent shoulders, and in grim silence. He talked with
ardour, despised and irrefutable. His picturesque and filthy loquacity
flowed like a troubled stream from a poisoned source. His beady little
eyes danced, glancing right and left, ever on the watch for the approach
of an officer. Sometimes Mr. Baker going forward to take a look at the
head sheets would roll with his uncouth gait through the sudden stillness
of the men; or Mr. Creighton limped along, smooth-faced, youthful, and
more stern than ever piercing our short silence with a keen glance of his
clear eyes. Behind his back Donkin would begin again darting stealthy,
sidelong looks. -- &amp;lsquo;'Ere's one of'em. Some of yer'as made 'im
fast that day. Much thanks yer got for hit. Ain't 'ee a-drivin' yer wusse'n
hever?....Let 'im slip hover-board....Vy not? It would 'ave been less trouble.
Vy not?&amp;rsquo; He advanced confidentially, backed away with great effect;
he whispered, he screamed, waved his miserable arms no thicker than

<P>pipe-stems -- stretched his lean neck -- spluttered -- squinted. In
the pauses of his impassioned orations the wine sighed quietly aloft, the
calm sea unheeded murmured in a warning whisper along the ship's side.
We abominated the creature and could not deny the luminous truth of his
contentions. It was all so obvious. We were indubitably good men; our deserts
were great and our pay small. Through our exertions we had saved the ship
and the skipper would get the credit of it. What had he done? we wanted
to know. Donkin asked: -- &amp;lsquo;What 'ee could do without hus?&amp;rsquo;
and we could not answer. We were oppressed by the injustice of the world,
surprised to perceive how long we had lived under its burden without realising
our unfortunate state, annoyed by the uneasy suspicion of our undiscerning
stupidity. Donkin assured us it was all our &amp;lsquo;good 'eartedness,&amp;rsquo;
but we would not be consoled by such shallow sophistry. We were men enough
to courageously admit to ourselves our intellectual shortcomings; though
from that time we refrained from kicking him, tweaking his nose or from
accidentally knocking him about, which last, after we had weathered the
Cape, had been rather a popular amusement. Davies ceased to talk at him
provokingly about black eyes and flattened noses. Charley, much subdued
since the gale, sis not jeer at him. Knowles deferentially and with a crafty
air propounded questions such as: -- &amp;lsquo;Could we all have the same
grub as the mates? Could we all stop ashore till we got it? What would
be the next thing to try for if we got that?&amp;rsquo; He answered readily
with contemptuous certitude; he strutted with assurance in clothes that
were much too big for him as though he had tried to disguise himself. These
were Jimmy's clothes most -- though he would accept anything from anybody;
but nobody, except Jimmy, had anything to spare. His devotion to Jimmy
was unbounded. He was for ever dodging in the little cabin, ministering
to Jimmy's wants, humoring his whims, submitting to his exacting peevishness,
often laughing with him. Nothing could keep him away from the pious work
of visiting the sick, especially when there was some heavy hauling to be
done on deck. Mr. Baker had on two occasions jerked him out of there by
the scruff of the neck to our inexpressible scandal. Was a sick chap to
be left without attendance? Were we to be ill-used for attending a shipmate?
-- &amp;lsquo;What?&amp;rsquo; growled Mr.

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 76</TT>

<P>Baker, turning menacingly at the mutter, and the whole half-circle like
one man stepped back a pace. &amp;lsquo;Set the topmast stunsail. Away
aloft Donkin, overhaul the gear.&amp;rsquo; ordered the mate inflexibly.
&amp;lsquo;Fetch the sail along; bend the down-haul clear. Bear a hand.&amp;rsquo;
Then, the sail set, he would go slowly aft and stand looking at the compass
for a long time, careworn, pensive, and breathing hard as if stifled by
the taint o unaccoutable ill-will that pervaded the ship. &amp;lsquo;What's
up amongst them?&amp;rsquo; he thought. &amp;lsquo;Can't make out this
hanging back and growling. A good crowd, too, as they go nowadays.&amp;rsquo;
On deck the men exchanged bitter words, suggested by a silly exasperation
against something unjust and irremediable that would not be denied, and
would whisper into their ears long after Donkin had ceased speaking. Our
little world went on its curved and unswerving path carrying a discontented
and aspiring population. They found comfort of a gloomy kind in an interminable
and conscientious analysis of their unappreciated worth; and inspired by
Donkin's hopeful doctrines they dreamed enthusiastically of the time when
every lonely ship would travel over a serene sea, manned by a wealthy and
well-fed crew of satisfied skippers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It looked as if it would be a long passage. The south-east
trades, light and unsteady, were left behind; and then, on the equator
and under a low grey sky, the ship, in close heat, floated upon a smooth
sea that resembled a sheet of ground glass. Thunder squalls hung on the
horizon, circled round the ship, far off and growling angrily, like a troop
of wild beasts afraid to charge home. The invisible sun, sweeping above
the upright masts, made on the clouds a blurred stain of rayless light,
and a similar patch of faded radiance kept pace with it from east to west
over the unglittering level of the waters. At night, through the impenetrable
darkness of earth and heaven, broad sheets of flame waved noiselessly;
and for half a second the becalmed craft stood out with its masts and rigging,
with every sail and every rope distinct and black in the centre of a fiery
outburst, like a charred ship enclosed in a globe of fire. And, again,
for long hours she remained lost in a vast universe of night and silence
where gentle sighs wandering here and there like forlorn souls, made the
still sails flutter as in sudden fear, and the ripple of a beshrouded ocean
whisper its compassion afar -- in a voice mournful, immense, and faint.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lamp was put out, and through the door thrown
wide open, Jimmy, turning on his pillow, could see vanishing beyond the
straight line of top-gallant rail, the quick, repeated visions of a fabulous
world made up of leaping fire and sleeping water. The lightning gleamed
in his big sad eyes that seemed in a red flicker to burn themselves out
in his black face, and then he would lay blinded and invisible in the midst
of an intense darkness. He could hear on the quiet deck soft footfalls,
the breathing of some man lounging on the doorstep; the low creak of swaying
masts; or the calm voice of the watch-officer reverberating aloft, hard
and loud, amongst the unstirring sails. he listened with avidity, taking
a rest in the attentive perception of the slightest sound from the fatiguing
wanderings of his sleeplessness. He was cheered by the rattling of blocks,
reassured by the stir and murmur of the watch, soothed by the slow yawn
of some sleepy and weary seaman settling himself deliberately for a snooze
on the planks. Life seemed an indestructible thing. It went on in darkness,
in sunshine. in sleep; tireless, it hovered affectionately round the imposture
of his ready death. It was bright, like the twisted flare of lightning,
and more full of surprises than the dark night. It made him safe, and the
calm of its overpowering darkness was as precious as its restless and dangerous
light.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the evening, in the dog-watches, and even far into
the first night-watch, a knot of men could always be seen congregated before
Jimmy's cabin. They leaned on each side of the door, peacefully interested
and with crossed legs; they stood astride the doorstep discoursing, or
sat in silent couples on his sea-chest; while against the bulwark along
the spare topmast, three or four in a row stared meditatively, with their
simple faces lit up by the projected glare of Jimmy's lamp. The little
place, repainted white, had, in the night, the brilliance of a silver shrine
where a black idol, reclining stiffly under a blanket, blinked its weary
eyes and received our homage. Donkin officiated. He had the air of a demonstrator
showing a phenomenon, a manifestation bizarre, simple, and meritorious,
that, to the beholders, should be a profound and an everlasting lesson.
&amp;lsquo;Just look at 'im, 'e knows what's what -- never fear!&amp;rsquo;
he exclaimed now and then, flourishing a hand hard and fleshless like the
claw of a snipe. Jimmy, on his back, smiled with

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 78</TT>

<P>reserve and without moving a limb. He affected the languor of extreme
weakness, so as to make it manifest to us that our delay in hauling him
out from his horrible confinement, and then that night spent on the poop
among out selfish neglect of his needs, had &amp;lsquo;done for him.&amp;rsquo;
He rather liked to talk about it, and of course we were always interested.
He spoke spasmodically, in fast rushes with long pauses between, as a tipsy
man walks.....&amp;lsquo;Cook had just given me a pannikin of hot coffee....Slapped
it down there, on my chest -- banged the door to..... I felt a heavy roll
coming; tried to save my coffee, burnt my fingers....and fell out of my
bunk.....She went over so quick.....Water came in through the ventilator.....I
couldn't move the door to.....dark as a grave....tried to scramble up into
the upper berth.....Rats....a rat bit my finger as I got up.....I could
hear him swimming below me.....I thought you would never come.....I thought
you were all gone overboard....of course....could hear nothing but the
wind.....Then you came....to look for the corpse, I suppose. A little more
and....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Man! but ye made a rare lot of noise in here,&amp;rsquo;
observee Archie, thoughtfully.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;You chaps kicked up such a confounded row above.....Enough
to scare any one.....I didn't know what you were up to.....Bash in the
blamed planks....my head.....Just what a silly, scary gang of fools would
do.....Not much good to me anyhow.....Just as well....drown.....Pah.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He groaned, snapped his big white teeth, and gazed with
scorn. Belfast lifted a pair of dolorous eyes, with a broken-hearted smile,
clenched his fists stealthily; blue-eyed Archie caressed his red whiskers
with a hesitating hand;; the boatswain at the door stared a moment, and
brusquely went away with a loud guffaw. Wamibo dreamed.....Donkin felt
all over his sterile chin for the few rare hairs, and said, triumphantly,
with a sidelong glance at Jimmy: -- &amp;lsquo;Look at 'im! Wish I was
'arf as 'ealthy has 'e his -- I do.&amp;rsquo; He jerked a short thumb
over his shoulder towards the after end of the ship. &amp;lsquo;That's
the blooming way to do 'em!&amp;rsquo; he yelped, with forced heartiness.
Jimmy said: -- &amp;lsquo;Don't be a dam' fool,&amp;rsquo; in a pleasant
voice. Knowles, rubbing his shoulder against the doorpost, remarked shrewdly:
-- &amp;lsquo;We can't all go an' be took sick -- it would be

<P>mutiny.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Mutiny -- gawn!&amp;rsquo; jeered Donkin;
&amp;lsquo;there's no bloomin' law against bein' sick.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;There's
six weeks' hard for refoosing dooty,&amp;rsquo; argued Knowles, &amp;lsquo;I
mind I once seed in Cardiff the crew of an overloaded ship -- leastways
she weren't overloaded, only a fatherly old gentleman with a white beard
and an umbreller came along the quay and talked to the hands. Said as how
it was crool hard to be drownded in winter just for the sake of a few pounds
more for the owner -- he said. Nearly cried over them -- he did; and he
had a square mainsail coat, and a gaff-topsail hat too -- all proper. So
they chaps they said they wouldn't go to be drownded in winter -- depending
upon that 'ere Plimsoll man to see 'em through the court. They thought
to have a bloomin' lark and two or three days spree. And the beak giv'
'em six weeks -- coss the ship warn't overloaded. Anyways they made it
out in court that she wasn't. There wasn't one overloaded ship in Penarth
Dock at all. 'Pears that old coon he was only on papy and allowance from
some kind people, under orders to look for overloaded ships, and he couldn't
see no further than the length of his umbreller. Some of us in the boarding-house,
where I live when I'm looking for a ship in Cardiff, stood by to duck that
old weeping sponger in the dock. We kept a good look out, too -- but he
topped his boom directly he was outside the court.....Yes. They got six
weeks' hard.....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They listened, full of curiosity, nodding in the pauses
their rough pensive faces. Donkin opened his mouth once or twice, but restrained
himself. Jimmy lay still with open eyes and not at all interested. A seaman
emitted an opinion that after a verdict of atrocious partiality &amp;lsquo;the
bloomin' beaks go an' drink at the skipper's expense.&amp;rsquo; Others
assented. It was clear, of course, Donkin said: -- &amp;lsquo;Well, six
weeks hain't much trouble. You sleep hall night in, reg'lar, in chokey.
Do it hon my 'ead.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;You are used to it ainch'ee, Donkin?&amp;rsquo;
asked somebody. Jimmy condescended to laugh. It cheered every one wonderfully.
Knowles, with surprising mental agility, shifted his ground. &amp;lsquo;If
we all went sick what would happen to the ship? eh?&amp;rsquo; He posed
the problem and grinned all round. -- &amp;lsquo;Let 'er go to 'ell,&amp;rsquo;
sneered Donkin. &amp;lsquo;Damn 'er. She ain't yourn.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;What?
Just let her drift?&amp;rsquo; insisted Knowles in a tone of unbelief.
-- &amp;lsquo;Aye! Drift an' be blowed,&amp;rsquo; affirmed Donkin with
fine recklessness. The other did not see it -- meditated. -- &amp;lsquo;The
stores would run out,&amp;rsquo; he muttered, &amp;lsquo;and....never get
anywhere....and what about pay-day?&amp;rsquo; he added with greater assurance.
-- &amp;lsquo;Jack likes a good pay-day,&amp;rsquo; exclaimed a listener
on the doorstep. &amp;lsquo;Aye, because then the girls put one arm round
his neck an' t'other in his pocket, an' call him ducky. Don't they, Jack?&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Jack, you're a terror with the gals.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;He
takes three of 'em in tow to once, like one of 'em Watkinses two-funnel
tugs waddling away with three schooners behind.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Jack,
you're a lame scamp.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Jack, tell us about that
one with a blue eye and a black eye. Do&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;There's
plenty of girls with one black eye along the Highway by.... &amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;No, that's a speshul one -- come Jack.&amp;rsquo; Donkin
looked severe and disgusted; Jimmy very bored; a grey-haired sea-dog s
hook his head slightly, smiling at the bowl of his pipe, discreetly amused.
Knowles turned about bewildered; stammered first at one, then at another.
-- &amp;lsquo;No!.... I never!....can't talk sensible sense amidst you.....
Always on the kid.&amp;rsquo; He retired bashfully -- muttering and pleased.
They laughed hooting in the crude light, around Jimmy's bed, where on a
white pillow his hollowed black face moved to and fro restlessly. A puff
of wind came, made the flame of the lamp leap, and outside, high up, the
sails fluttered, while near by the block of the foresheet struck a ringing
blow on the iron bulwark. A voice far off cried, &amp;lsquo;Helm up!&amp;rsquo;
another, more faint, answered, &amp;lsquo;Hard up, sir!&amp;rsquo; They
became silent -- waiting expectantly. The grey-haired seaman knocked his
pipe on the doorstep and stood up. The ship leaned over gently and the
sea seemed to wake up, murmuring drowsily. &amp;lsquo;Here's a little wind
comin',&amp;rsquo;said some one very low, Jimmy turned over slowly to face
the breeze. The voice in the night cried loud and commanding: -- &amp;lsquo;Haul
the spanker out.&amp;rsquo; The group before the door vanished out of the
light. They could be heard tramping aft while they repeated with various
intonations: -- &amp;lsquo;Spanker out!....&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Out spanker,
sir!&amp;rsquo; Donkin remained alone with Jimmy. There was a silence.
Jimmy opened and shut his lips several times as if swallowing draughts
of fresher air; Donkin moved the toes of his bare feet and looked at them
thoughtfully.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Ain't you going to give give them a hand with
the sail?&amp;rsquo; asked Jimmy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;No. Hif six ov 'em hain't 'nough beef to set
that blamed, rotten

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 81</TT>

<P>spanker, they hain't fit to live,&amp;rsquo; answered Donkin in a bored,
faraway voice, as though he had been talking from the bottom of a hole.
Jimmy considered the conical, fowl-like profile with a queer kind of interest;
he was leaning out of his bunk with the calculating, uncertain expression
of a man who reflects how best to lay hold of some strange creature that
looks as though it could sting or bite. But he said only: -- &amp;lsquo;The
mate will miss you -- and there will be ructions.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin got up to go. &amp;lsquo;I will do for 'im hon some
dark night, see hif I don't,&amp;rsquo; he said over his shoulder.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy went on quickly: -- &amp;lsquo;You're like a poll-parrot,
like a screechin' poll-parrot.&amp;rsquo; Donkin stopped and cocked his
head attentively on one side. His big ears stood our, transparent and veined,
resembling the thin wings of a bat.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Yuss?&amp;rsquo; he said, with his back towards
Jimmy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Yes! Chatter out all you know -- like....like
a dirty white cockatoo.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin waited. He could hear the other's breathing, long
and slow; the breathing of a man with a hundredweight or so on the breast-bone.
Then he asked calmly: -- &amp;lsquo;What do I know?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;What?....What I tell you....not much. What do
you want....to talk about my health so....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Hit's a bloomin' himposyshun. A bloomin', stinkin',
first-class himposyshun -- but hit don't tyke me hin. Not hit.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy kept still. Donkin put his hands in his pockets,
and in one slouching stride came up to the bunk.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I talk -- what's the hodds. They hain't men
here -- sheep they hare. A driven lot of sheep. I 'old you hup.... Vy not?
you're well hoff.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I am....I don't say anything about that.....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Well, Let 'em see hit. Let 'em larn what a man
can do. I ham a man. I know hall about yer..... &amp;rsquo;Jimmy threw
himself further away on the pillow; the other stretched out his skinny
neck, jerked his bird face down at him as though pecking at the eyes. &amp;lsquo;I
ham a man. I've seen the hinside of every chokey in the Colonis rather'n
give hup my rights.....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;You are a jail-prop,&amp;rsquo; said Jimmy weakly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I ham....an' proud of it too. You! You 'aven't
the bloomin'

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 82</TT>

<P>nerve -- so you hinvented this 'ere dodge.....&amp;rsquo; He paused,
then with marked afterthought accentuated slowly: -- &amp;lsquo;Yer ain't
sick -- hare yer?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;No,&amp;rsquo; said Jimmy firmly. &amp;lsquo;Been
out of sorts now and again this year,&amp;rsquo; he mumbled with a sudden
drop in his voice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin closed one eye, amicable and confidential. He whispered:
-- &amp;lsquo;Ye 'ave done it afore -- aven'tchee?&amp;rsquo; Jimmy smiled
-- then as if unable to hold back he let himself go: -- &amp;lsquo;Last
ship -- yes. I was out of sorts on the passage. See? It was easy. They
paid me off in Calcutta, and the skipper made no bones about it either.....I
got my money all right. Laid up fifty-eight days! The fools! O Lord! The
fools! Paid right off.&amp;rsquo; He laughed spasmodically. Donkin chummed
giggling. Then Jimmy coughed violently. &amp;lsquo;I am as well as ever,&amp;rsquo;
he said, as soon as he could draw breath.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin made a derisive gesture. &amp;lsquo;In course,&amp;rsquo;
he said profoundly, &amp;lsquo;hany one can see that.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;They
don't.&amp;rsquo; said Jimmy, gasping like a fish. -- -- &amp;lsquo;They
would swallow any yarn,&amp;rsquo; affirmed Donkin. -- &amp;lsquo;Don't
you let on too much,&amp;rsquo; admonished Jimmy in an exhausted voice.
-- &amp;lsquo;Your little gyme? Eh?&amp;rsquo; commented Donkin jovially.
Then with sudden disgust: &amp;lsquo;Yer hall for yerself, s'long has ye're
right.....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So charged with egoism James Wait pulled the blanket up
to his chin and lay still for awhile. His heavy lips protruded in an everlasting
black pout. &amp;lsquo;Why are you so hot on making trouble?&amp;rsquo;
he asked without much interest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Cos hit's a bloomin' shayme. We hare put hon....bad
food, bad pay.... I want hus to kick up a bloomin' row; a blamed 'owling
row that would make 'em remember! Knocking people habout....brain hus....hindeed!
Ain't we men?&amp;rsquo; His altruistic indignation blazed. Then he said
calmly; -- &amp;lsquo;I've been a-hairing of yer clothes&amp;rsquo; --
&amp;lsquo;All right,&amp;rsquo; said Jimmy languidly, &amp;lsquo;bring
them in.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Giv' us the key of your chest, I'll put
'em away for yer,&amp;rsquo; said Donkin with friendly eagerness. -- &amp;lsquo;Bring
'em in, I will put them away myself.&amp;rsquo; answered James Wait with
severity. Donkin looked down, muttering.....&amp;lsquo;What d'you say?
What d'you say?&amp;rsquo; inquired Wait anxiously, -- &amp;lsquo;Nothink.
The night's dry, let 'em 'ang out till the morning,&amp;rsquo; said Donkin,
in a strangely trembling voice, as though restraining laughter or rage.
Jimmy seemed satisfied. -- &amp;lsquo;Give me a little water for the night
in my mug -- there,&amp;rsquo;he said.

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 83</TT>

<P>Donkin took a stride over the doorstep. -- &amp;lsquo;Git it yerself,&amp;rsquo;
he replied in a surly tone. &amp;lsquo;You can do it, hunless you <I>hare</I>sick.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Of course I can do it,&amp;rsquo; said Wait, &amp;lsquo;only....&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Well, then, do it.&amp;rsquo; said Donkin viciously, &amp;lsquo;if
yer can look hafter yer clothes, yer can look hafter yerself.&amp;rsquo;
He went on deck without a look back.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy reached out for the mug. Not a drop. He put it back
gently with a faint sigh -- and closed his eyes. He thought: -- That lunatic
Belfast will bring me some water if I ask. Fool. I am very thirsty.....It
was very hot in the cabin, and it seemed to turn slowly round, detach itself
from the ship, and swing out smoothly into a luminous arid space where
a black sun shone, spinning very fast. A place without any water! No water!
A policeman with the face of Donkin drank a glass of beer by the side of
an empty well, and flew away flapping vigorously. A ship whose mastheads
protruded through the sky and could not be seen, was discharging grain,
and the wind whirled the dry husks in spirals along the quay of a dock
with no water in it. He whirled the dry husks in spirals along with the
husks -- and more dry. He expanded his hollow chest. The air streamed in
carrying away in its rush a lot of strange things that resembled houses,
trees, people, lamp-posts..... No more! There was no more air -- and he
had not finished drawing his long breath. But he was in gaol! They were
locking him up. A door slammed. They turned the key twice, flung a bucket
of water over him -- Phoo! What for?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened his eyes, thinking the fall had been very heavy
for an empty man -- empty -- empty. He was in his cabin. Ah! All right!
His face was streaming with perspiration, his arms heavier than lead. He
saw the cook standing in the doorway, a brass key in one hand and a bright
tin hook-pot in the other.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I have been locking up for the night,&amp;rsquo;
said the cook, beaming benevolently. &amp;lsquo;Eight-bells just gone.
I brought you a pot of cold tea for your night's drinking, Jimmy. I sweetened
it with some white cabin sugar, too. Well -- it won't break the ship.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He came in, hung the pot on the edge of the bunk, asked
perfunctorily, &amp;lsquo;How goes it?&amp;rsquo; and sat down on the box.
-- &amp;lsquo;H'm,&amp;rsquo; grunted Wait inhospitably. The cook wiped
his face with a dirty cotton rag, which, afterwards, he tied around his
neck. -- &amp;lsquo;That's how them

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 84</TT>

<P>firemen do in steamboats,&amp;rsquo; he said serenely, and much pleased
with himself. &amp;lsquo;My work is as heavy as theirs -- I'm thinking
-- and longer hours. did you ever see them down the stokehold? Like fiends
they look -- firing -- firing -- firing -- down there.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He pointed his forefinger at the deck. Some gloomy thought
darkened his shining face, fleeting, like the shadow of a traveling cloud
over the light of a peaceful sea. The relieved watch tramped noisily forward,
passing in a body across the sheen of the doorway. Some one cried, &amp;lsquo;Good
night!&amp;rsquo; Belfast stopped for a moment and looked in at Jimmy,
quivering and speechless as if with repressed emotion. He gave the cook
a glance charged with dismal foreboding, and vanished. The cook cleared
his throat, Jimmy stared upwards and kept as still as a man in hiding.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was clear, with a gentle breeze. The ship heeled
over a little, slipping quietly over a sombre sea towards the inaccessible
and festal splendor of a black horizon pierced by points of flickering
fire. Above the mastheads the resplendent curve of the Milky Way spanned
the sky like a triumphant arch of eternal light, thrown over the dark pathway
of the earth. On the forecastle head a man whistled with loud precision
a lively jig, while another could be heard faintly, shuffling and stamping
in time. There came from forward a confused murmur of voices, laughter
-- snatches of song. The cook shook his head, glanced obliquely at Jimmy,
and began to mutter. &amp;lsquo;Aye. Dance and sing. That's all they think
of. I am surprised the Providence don't get tired.....They forget the day
that's sure to come....but you.....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy drank a gulp of tea, hurriedly, as though he had
stolen it, and shrank under his blanket, edging away towards the bulkhead.
The cook got up, closed the door, then sat down again and said distinctly:
--

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Whenever I poke my galley fire I think of you
chaps -- swearing, stealing, lying, and worse -- as if there was no such
thing as another world.....Not bad fellows, either, in a way,&amp;rsquo;
he conceded slowly; then, after a pause of regretful musing he went on
in a resigned tone: -- &amp;lsquo;Well, well. they will have a hot time
of it. Hot! Did I say? The furnaces of one of them White Star boats ain't
nothing to it.&amp;rsquo; He kept quiet for a while. There was a great
stir in his brain; an addled vision of bright outlines; an exciting row
of rousing

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 85</TT>

<P>songs and groans of pain. He suffered, enjoyed, admired, approved. He
was delighted, frightened, exalted -- like on that evening (the only time
in his life -- twenty-seven years ago; he loved to recall the number of
years) when as a young man he had -- through keeping bad company -- become
intoxicated in an East-end music-hall. A tide of sudden feeling swept him
clean out of his body. He soared. He contemplated the secret of the hereafter.
It commended itself to him. It was excellent; he loved it, himself, all
hands, and Jimmy. His heart overflowed with tenderness with comprehension,
with the desire to meddle, with anxiety for the soul of that black man,
with the pride of possessed eternity, with the feeling of might. Snatch
him up in his arms and pitch him right into the middle of salvation....the
black soul -- blacker -- body -- rot -- Devil. No! Talk -- strength --
Samson..... There was a great din as of cymbals in his ears; he flashed
through an ecstatic jumble of shining faces, lilies, prayer-books, unearthly
joy, white shirts, gold harps, black coats, wings. He saw flowing garments,
clean shaved faces, a sea of light -- -- a lake of pitch. There were sweet
scents, a smell of sulphur -- red tongues of flame licking a white mist.
An awesome voice thundered!....It lasted three seconds.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Jimmy!&amp;rsquo; he cried in an inspired tone.
Then he hesitated. A spark of human pity glimmered yet through the infernal
fog of his supreme conceit.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;What?&amp;rsquo; said James Wait, unwillingly.
There was a silence. He turned his head just the least bit and stole a
cautious glance. The cook's lips moved inaudibly; his face was rapt his
eyes turned up. He seemed to be mentally imploring deck beams, the brass
hook of the lamp, two cockroaches.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Look here,&amp;rsquo; said James Wait, &amp;lsquo;I
want to go to sleep. I think I could.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;This is no time for sleep!&amp;rsquo; exclaimed
the cook, very loud. He had prayerfully divested himself of the last vestige
of his humanity. He was a voice -- a fleshless and sublime thing, as on
that memorable night -- the night when he went over the sea to make coffee
for perishing sinners. &amp;lsquo;This is no time for sleeping,&amp;rsquo;
he repeated with exaltation. &amp;lsquo;I can't sleep.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Don't care damn,&amp;rsquo; said Wait, with
factitious energy. &amp;lsquo;I can. go an' turn in.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Swear....in the very jaws!....In the very jaws!
Don't you see the fire....don't you feel it? Blind, chock-full of sin!
I can see it for you. I can't bear it. I hear the call to save you. Night
and day. Jimmy let me save you!&amp;rsquo; The words of entreaty and menace
broke out of him in a roaring torrent. The cockroaches ran away. Jimmy
perspired, wriggling stealthily under his blanket. The cook yelled.....&amp;lsquo;Your
days are numbered!....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Get out of this,&amp;rsquo;
boomed Wait, courageously. -- &amp;lsquo;Pray with me!....&amp;rsquo; --
&amp;lsquo;I won't!....&amp;rsquo;the little cabin was as hot as an oven.
It contained an immensity of fear and pain; an atmosphere of shrieks and
moans; prayers vociferated like blasphemies and whispered curses. Outside,
the men called by Charley , who informed them in tones of delight that
there was a row going on in Jimmy's place, pushed before the closed door,
too startled to open it. All hands were there. The watch below had jumped
up, asked: -- &amp;lsquo;What is it?&amp;rsquo; Others said: -- &amp;lsquo;Listen!&amp;rsquo;
The muffled screaming went on: -- &amp;lsquo;On your knees! On your knees!&amp;rsquo;
-- Shut up! -- &amp;lsquo;Never! You are delivered into my hands.....Your
life has been saved.....Purpose.....Mercy..... Repent.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;You
are a crazy fool!....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Account of you.... you....Never
sleep in this world, if I....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Leave off.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;No!....stokehold....only think!....&amp;rsquo; Then an impassioned
screeching babble where words pattered like hail. -- &amp;lsquo;No!&amp;rsquo;
shouted Jim. -- &amp;lsquo;Yes. You are!....No help.....Everybody says
so.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;You lie!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I see you
dying this minnyt!....before my eyes....as good as dead now.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Help!&amp;rsquo; shouted Jimmy, piercingly. -- &amp;lsquo;Not
in this valley....look upwards,&amp;rsquo; howled the other. -- &amp;lsquo;Go
away! Murder!Help!&amp;rsquo; clamoured Jimmy. His voice broke. There were
moanings, low mutters, a few sobs.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;What's the matter now?&amp;rsquo; said a seldom-heard
voice. -- &amp;lsquo;Fall back, men! Fall back, there!&amp;rsquo; repeated
Mr. Creighton sternly, pushing through -- &amp;lsquo;Here's the old man.&amp;rsquo;
whispered some. -- &amp;lsquo;The cook's in there, sir&amp;rsquo; exclaimed
several, backing away. The door clattered open; a broad stream of light4
darted out on wondering faces; a warm whiff of vitiated air passed. The
two mates towered head and shoulders above the spare, grey-headed man who
stood revealed between them, in shabby clothes, stiff and angular like
a small carved figure, and with a thin, composed face. The cook got up
from knees. Jimmy sat high in the bunk, clasping his drawn-up

<P>

<P><TT>Page 87</TT>

<P>legs. The tassel of the blue nightcap almost imperceptibly trembled
over his knees. They gazed astonished at his long, curved back, while the
white corner of one eye gleamed blindly at them. He was afraid to turn
his head, he shrank within himself; and there was an aspect astounding
and animal-like in the perfection of his expectant immobility. A thing
of instinct -- the unthinking stillness of a scared brute.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;What are you doing here?&amp;rsquo; asked Mr.
Baker, sharply. -- &amp;lsquo;My duty,&amp;rsquo; said the cook, with ardour.
-- &amp;lsquo;Your.... what?&amp;rsquo;began the mate. Captain Allistoun
touched his arm lightly. -- &amp;lsquo;I know his caper,&amp;rsquo; he
said, in a low voice. &amp;lsquo;Coome out of that, Podmore,&amp;rsquo;
he ordered aloud.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The cook wrung his hands, shook his fists above his head,
and his arms dropped as if too heavy. For a moment he stood distracted
and speechless. -- &amp;lsquo;Never,&amp;rsquo; he stammered, &amp;lsquo;I....he....I.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;What -- do -- you -- say?&amp;rsquo; pronounced Captain Allistoun.
&amp;lsquo;Come out at once -- or....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I am going.&amp;rsquo;
said the cook, with a hasty and sombre resignation. He strode over the
doorstep firmly -- hesitated -- made a few steps. They looked at him in
silence. -- &amp;lsquo;I make you responsible!&amp;rsquo; he cried desperately,
turning half round. &amp;lsquo;That man is dying. I make you....&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;You there yet?&amp;rsquo; called the master in a threatening
tone. -- &amp;lsquo;No, sir,&amp;rsquo; he exclaimed hurriedly in a startled
voice. The boatswain led him away by the arm; some one laughed; Jimmy lifted
his head for a stealthy glance, and in one unexpected leap sprang out of
his bunk; Mr. Baker made a clever catch and felt him very limp in his arms;
the group at the door grunted with surprise. -- &amp;lsquo;He lies,&amp;rsquo;
gasped Wait. &amp;lsquo;He talked about black devils -- he is a devil --
a white devil -- I am all right.&amp;rsquo; He stiffened himself, and Mr.
Baker, experimentally, let him go. He staggered a pace or two; Captain
Allistoun watched him with a quiet and penetrating gaze; Belfast ran to
his support. He did not appear to be aware of any one near him; he stood
silent for a moment, battling single-handed with a legion of nameless terrors
amidst the eager looks of excited men who watched him far off, utterly
alone in the impenetrable solitude of his fear. Heavy breathings stirred
the darkness. The sea gurgled through the scuppers as the ship heeled over
to a short puff of wind.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Keep him away from me,&amp;rsquo; said James
Wait at last in his fine

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 88</TT>

<P>baritone voice, and leaning with all his weight on Belfast's neck. &amp;lsquo;I've
been better this last week....I am well....I was going back to duty....
-- now if you like -- Captain.&amp;rsquo; Belfast hitched his shoulders
to keep him upright.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;No,&amp;rsquo; said the master, looking at him
fixedly.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Jimmy's armpit Belfast's red face moved uneasily.
A row of eyes gleaming stared on the edge of light. They pushed one another
with elbows, turned their heads, whispered. Wait let his chin fall on his
breast and, with lowered eyelids, looked round in a suspicious manner.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Why not?&amp;rsquo; cried a voice from the shadows,
&amp;lsquo;the man's all right, sir.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I am all right,&amp;rsquo; said Wait with eagerness.
&amp;lsquo;Been sick....better....turn-to now.&amp;rsquo; He sighed. --
&amp;lsquo;Howly Mother!&amp;rsquo; exclaimed Belfast with a heave of the
shoulders, &amp;lsquo;stand up, Jimmy.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Keep away
from me then,&amp;rsquo; said Wait, giving Belfast a petulant push, and
reeling against the door-post. His cheek-bones glistened as though they
had been varnished. He snatched off his night-cap, wiped his perspiring
face with it, flung it on the deck. &amp;lsquo;I am coming out,&amp;rsquo;
he said without stirring.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;No. You don't,&amp;rsquo; said the master curtly.
Bare feet shuffled, disapproving voices murmured all round; he went on
as if he had not heard: -- &amp;lsquo;You have been skulking nearly all
the passage and now you want to come out. You think you are near enough
to the pay-table now. Smell the shore, hey?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I've been sick..... now -- better,&amp;rsquo;
mumbled Wait glaring in the light. -- &amp;lsquo;You have been shamming
sick,&amp;rsquo; retorted Captain Allistoun with severity: &amp;lsquo;Why....&amp;rsquo;
he hesitated for less than half a second. &amp;lsquo;Why, anybody can see
that. There's nothing the matter with you, but you choose to lie-up to
please yourself -- and now you shall lie-up to please me. Mr. baker, my
orders are that this man is not to be allowed on deck to the end of the
passage.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There were exclamations of surprise, triumph, indignation.
The dark group of men swung across the light. &amp;lsquo;What for?&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;Told you so....&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Bloomin' shame.... &amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;We've got to say something habout that,&amp;rsquo; screeched
Donkin from the rear. -- &amp;lsquo;Never mind, Jim -- &amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;We'll
see you righted,&amp;rsquo; called several together. An elderly seaman
stepped to the front. &amp;lsquo;D'ye mean to say, sir,&amp;rsquo; he asked
ominously, &amp;lsquo;that a sick chap ain't allowed to get well in this
'ere hooker?&amp;rsquo; Behind him Donkin whispered excitedly amongst a
staring crowd where no one spared him a glance, but Captain Allistoun shook
a forefinger at the angry bronzed face of the speaker. -- &amp;lsquo;You
-- you hold your tongue,&amp;rsquo; he said warningly. -- &amp;lsquo;This
isn't the way,&amp;rsquo; clamoured two or three younger men. &amp;lsquo;Hare
we bloomin' masheens?&amp;rsquo; inquired Donkin in a piercing tone, and
dived under the elbows of the front rank. -- &amp;lsquo;Soon show'im we
ain't boys....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;The man's a man if he is black.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;We ain't goin' to work this bloomin' ship shorthanded if
Snowball's all right....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;He says he is.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Well then, strike, boys, strike!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;That's
the bloomin' ticket.&amp;rsquo; Captain Allistoun said sharply to the second
mate:&amp;lsquo;Keep quiet, Mr. Creighton,&amp;rsquo; and stood composed
in the tumult, listening with profound attention to mixed growls and screeches,
to every exclamation and every curse of the sudden outbreak. Somebody slammed
the cabin door to with a kick; the darkness full of menacing mutters leaped
with a short clatter over the streak of light, and the men became gesticulating
shadows that growled, hissed, laughed excitedly. Mr. Baker whispered: --
&amp;lsquo;Get away from them, sir.&amp;rsquo; The big shape of Mr. Creighton
hovered silently about the slight figure of the master. -- &amp;lsquo;We
have been hymposed upon all this voyage,&amp;rsquo; said a gruff voice,
&amp;lsquo;but this 'ere fancy takes the cake.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;That
man is a shipmate.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Are we bloomin' kids?&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;The port watch will refuse duty.&amp;rsquo; Charley carried
away by his feelings whistled shrilly, then yelped: -- &amp;lsquo;Giv'
us our Jimmy!&amp;rsquo; This seemed to cause a variation in the disturbance.
There was a fresh burst of squabbling uproar. A lot of quarrels were going
on at once. -- &amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;No.&amp;rsquo; --
&amp;lsquo;N ever been sick.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Go for them to once.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Shut yer mouth, youngster -- this is men's work.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Is it?&amp;rsquo; muttered Captain Allistoun bitterly. Mr.
Baker grunted:&amp;lsquo;Ough! They're gone silly. They've been simmering
for the last month.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I did notice,&amp;rsquo; said
the master. -- &amp;lsquo;They have started a row amongst themselves now,&amp;rsquo;
said Mr. Creighton with disdain, &amp;lsquo;better get aft, sir. We will
soothe them.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Keep your temper, Creighton,&amp;rsquo;
said the master. And the three men began to move slowly towards the cabin
door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shadows of the fore rigging a dark mass stamped
eddied, advanced, retreated. There were words of reproach, encouragement,
unbelief, execration. The elder seamen, bewildered and

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 90</TT>

<P>angry, growled their determination to go through with something or othere;
but the younger school of advanced thought exposed their and Jimmy's wrongs
with confused shouts, arguing amongst themselves. They clustered round
that moribund carcass, the fit emblem of their aspirations. and encouraging
one another they swayed, they tramped on one spot, shouting that they would
not be &amp;lsquo;put upon&amp;rsquo; Inside the cabin, Belfast, helping
Jimmy into his bunk, twitched all over in his desire not to miss all the
row, and with difficulty restrained the tears of his facile emotion. James
Wait flat on his back under the blanket, gasped complaints. -- &amp;lsquo;We
will back you up, never fear,&amp;rsquo; assured Belfast, busy about his
feet. -- &amp;lsquo;I'll come out tomorrow -- skipper or no skipper.&amp;rsquo;
He lifted one arm with great difficulty, passed the hand over his face;
&amp;lsquo;Don't you let that cook....&amp;rsquo; he breathed out. -- &amp;lsquo;No,
no,&amp;rsquo; said Belfast, turning his back on the bunk, &amp;lsquo;I
will put a head on him if he comes near you.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I
will smash his mug!&amp;rsquo; exclaimed faintly Wait, enraged and weak;
&amp;lsquo;I don't want to kill a man, but....&amp;rsquo; He panted fast
like a dog after a run in sunshine. Some one just outside the door shouted,
&amp;lsquo;He's as fit as any ov us!&amp;rsquo; Belfast put his hand on
the door-handle. -- &amp;lsquo;Here!&amp;rsquo; called James Wait hurriedly
and in such a clear voice that the other spun round with a start. James
Wait, stretched out black and deathlike in the dazzling light, turned his
head on the pillow. His eyes stared at Belfast, appealing and impudent.
&amp;lsquo;I am rather weak from lying-up so long,&amp;rsquo; he said distinctly.
Belfast nodded. &amp;lsquo;Getting quite well now,&amp;rsquo; insisted
Wait. -- &amp;lsquo;Yes, I noticed you getting better this....last month,&amp;rsquo;
said Belfast looking down. &amp;lsquo;Hallo! What's this?&amp;rsquo; he
shouted and ran out.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was flattened directly against the side of the house
by two men who lurched against him. A lot of disputes seemed to be going
on all round. He got clear and was three distinct figures standing alone
in the fainter darkness under the arched foot of the mainsail, that rose
above their heads like a convex wall of a high edifice. Donkin hissed:
-- &amp;lsquo;Go for them.... it's dark!&amp;rsquo; The crowd took a short
run aft in a body -- then there was a check. Donkin, agile and thin flitted
past with his right arm going like a windmill -- and then stood still suddenly
with his arm pointing rigidly above his

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 91</TT>

<P>head. The hurtling flight of some small heavy object was heard; it passed
between the heads of the two mates, bounded heavily along the deck, stuck
the after hatch with a ponderous and deadened blow. The bulky shape of
Mr. Baker grew distinct. &amp;lsquo;Come to your senses, men!&amp;rsquo;
he cried, advancing at the arrested crowd. &amp;lsquo;Come back, Mr. Baker!&amp;rsquo;
called the master's quiet voice. He obeyed unwillingly. There was a minute
of silence, then a deafening hubbub arose. Above it Archie was heard energetically:
-- &amp;lsquo;If ye do oot ageen I wull tell!&amp;rsquo; There were shouts.
&amp;lsquo;Don't!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Drop it!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;We
ain't that kind!&amp;rsquo; The black cluster of human forms reeled against
the bulwark, back again towards the house. Shadowy figures could be seen
tottering, falling, leaping up. Ringbolts rang under stumbling feet. --
&amp;lsquo;Drop it!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Let me!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;No!&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Curse you!.... hah!&amp;rsquo; Then sounds as of some one's
face being slapped; a piece of iron fell on the deck; a short scuffle,
and some one's shadowy shadowy body scuttled rapidly across the main hatch
before the shadow of a kick. A raging voice sobbed out a torrent of filthy
language.... -- &amp;lsquo;Throwing things -- good God!&amp;rsquo; grunted
Mr. Baker in dismay. -- &amp;lsquo;That was meant for me,&amp;rsquo; said
the master quietly; &amp;lsquo;I felt the wind of that thing; what was
it -- an iron belaying-pin?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;By Jove!&amp;rsquo;
muttered Mr. Creighton. The confused voices of men talking amidships mingled
with the wash of the sea, ascended between the silent and distended sails
-- seemed to flow away into the night, further than the horizon, higher
than the sky. The stars burned steadily over the inclined mastheads. Trails
of light lay on the water, broke before the advancing hull, and, after
she had passed, trembled for a long time as if in awe of the murmuring
sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime the helmsman, anxious to know what the row was
about, had let go the wheel, and, bent double, ran with long stealthy footsteps
to the break of the poop. The <I>Narcissus</I>, left to herself, came up
gently to the wind without any one being aware of it. She gave a slight
roll, and the sleeping sails woke suddenly, coming all together with a
mighty flap against the masts, then filled again one after another in a
quick succession of loud reports that ran down the lofty spars, till the
collapsed mainsail flew out last with a violent jerk. The ship trembled
from trucks to keel; the sails kept on rattling like a discharge of musketry;
the chain sheets and loose shackles jingled aloft in a thin peal; the gin
blocks

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 92</TT>

<P>groaned. It was as if an invisible hand had given the ship an angry
shake to recall the men that peopled her decks to the sense of reality,
vigilance and duty. -- &amp;lsquo;Helm up!&amp;rsquo; cried the master
sharply. &amp;lsquo;Run aft, Mr. Creighton, and see what that fool there
is up to.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Flatten in the head sheets. Stand by
the weather fore-braces,&amp;rsquo; growled Mr. Baker. Startled men ran
swiftly repeating the orders. The watch below, abandoned all at once by
the watch on deck, drifted towards the forecastle in twos and threes, arguing
noisily as they went. -- &amp;lsquo;We shall see to-morrow!&amp;rsquo;
cried a loud voice, as if to cover with a menacing hint an inglorious retreat.
And then only orders were heard, the falling of heavy coils of rope, the
rattling of blocks. Singleton's white head flitted here and there in the
night, high above deck, like the ghost of a bird. -- &amp;lsquo;Going off,
sir!&amp;rsquo; shouted Mr. Creighton from aft. -- &amp;lsquo;Full again.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;All right....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Ease off the head
sheets. That will do the braces. Coil the ropes,&amp;rsquo; grunted Mr.
Baker, bustling about.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually the tramping noises, the confused sound of voices,
died out, and the officers, coming together on the poop discussed events.
Mr. Baker was bewildered and grunted; Mr. Creighton was calmly furious;
but Captain Allistoun was composed and thoughtful. He listened to Mr. Baker's
growling argumentation, to Creighton's interjected and severe remarks,
while looking down on the deck he weighed in his hand the iron belaying-pin
-- that a moment ago had just missed his head -- as if it had been the
only tangible fact of the whole transaction. He was one of those commanders
who speak little, seem to hear nothing, look at no one -- and know everything,
hear every whisper, see every fleeting shadow of their ship's life. His
two big officers towered above his lean, short figure; they talked over
his head; they were dismayed, surprised, and angry, while between them
the little quiet man seemed to have found his taciturn serenity in the
profound depths of a larger experience. Lights were burning in the forecastle;
now and then a gust of babbling chatter came from forward, swept over the
decks, and became faint, as if the unconscious ship gliding gently through
the great peace of the sea, had left behind and for ever the foolish noise
of turbulent mankind. But it was renewed again and again. Gesticulating
arms, profiles of heads with open mouths appeared for a moment in the illuminated
squares of

<P>

<P><TT>Page 93</TT>

<P>doorways; black fists darted -- withdrew.....&amp;lsquo;Yes. It was
most damnable to have such an unprovoked row sprung on one,&amp;rsquo;
assented the master.....A tumult of yells rose in the light, abruptly ceased.....He
didn't think there would be any further trouble just then..... A bell was
struck aft, another, forward, answered in a deeper tone, and the clamour
of ringing metal spread round the ship in a circle of wide vibrations that
ebbed away into the immeasurable night of an empty sea..... Didn't he know
them! Didn't he! In past years. Better men, too. Real men to stand by one
in a tight place. Worse than devils too sometimes -- downright, horned
devils. Pah! This -- nothing. A miss as good as a mile.....The wheel was
being relieved in the usual way. -- &amp;lsquo;Full and by,&amp;rsquo;
said, very loud, the man going off. -- &amp;lsquo;Full and by,&amp;rsquo;
repeated the other, catching hold of the spokes. -- &amp;lsquo;This head
wind is my trouble,&amp;rsquo; exclaimed the master, stamping his foot
in sudden anger; &amp;lsquo;head wind! all the rest is nothing.&amp;rsquo;
He was calm again in a moment. &amp;lsquo;Keep them on the move to-night,
gentlemen; just to let them feel we've got hold all the time -- quietly,
you know. Mind you keep your hands off them, Creighton. To-morrow I will
talk to them like a Dutch Uncle. A crazy crowd of tinkers! Yes, tinkers!
I could count the real sailors amongst them on the fingers of one hand.
Nothing will do but a row -- if -- you -- please.&amp;rsquo; He paused.
&amp;lsquo;Did you think I had gone wrong there Mr. Baker?&amp;rsquo; He
tapped his forehead, laughed short. &amp;lsquo;When I saw him standing
there, three parts dead and so scared -- black amongst that gaping lot
-- no grit to face what's coming to us all -- the notion came to me all
at once, before I could think. Sorry for him -- like you would be for a
sick bruter. If ever a creature was in a mortal funk to die!....I thought
I would let him go out in his own way. Kind of impulse. It never came into
my head, those fools.....H'm! Stand to it now -- of course.&amp;rsquo;
He stuck the belaying-pin in his pocket, seemed ashamed of himself, then
sharply: -- &amp;lsquo;If you see Podmore at his tricks again tell him
I will have him put under the pump. Had to do it once before. The fellow
breaks out like that now and then. Good cook tho'.&amp;rsquo; He walked
away quickly, came back to the companion. The two mates followed him through
the starlight with amazed eyes. He went down three steps, and changing
his tone, spoke with his head near the deck: -- &amp;lsquo;I shan't turn
in to-night. in case of anything; just call

<P>

<P><TT>Page 94</TT>

<P>out if... Did you see the eyes of that sick nigger, Mr. Baker? I fancied
he begged me for something. What? Past all help. One lone black beggar
amongst the lot of us, and he seemed to look through me into the very hell.
Fancy, this wretched Podmore! Well, let him die in peace. I am master here
after all. Say what I like. Let him be. He might have been half a man once....Keep
a good look-out.&amp;rsquo; He disappeared below, leaving his mates facing
one another, and more impressed than if they had seen a stone image shed
a miraculous tear of compassion over the incertitudes of life and death.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the blue mist spreading from twisted threads that stood
upright in the bowls of pipes, the forecastle appeared as vast as a hall.
Between the beams a heavy cloud stagnated; and the lamps surrounded by
halos burned each at the core of a purple glow in two lifeless flames without
rays. Wreaths drifted in denser wisps. Men sprawled about on the deck,
sat in negligent poses, or, bending a knee, drooped with one shoulder against
a bulkhead. Lips moved, eyes flashed, waving arms made sudden eddies in
the smoke. The murmur of voices seemed to pile itself higher and higher
as if unable to run out quick enough through the narrow doors. The watch
below in their shirts, and striding on long white legs resembled raving
somnambulists; while now and then one of the watch on deck would rush in,
looking strangely over-dressed, listen a moment, fling a rapid sentence
into the noise and run out again; but a few remained near the door, fascinated,
and with one ear turned to the deck. -- &amp;lsquo;Stick together, boys,&amp;rsquo;
roared Davis. Belfast tried to make himself heard. Knowles grinned in a
slow, dazed way. A short fellow with a thick clipped beard kept on yelling
periodically: -- &amp;lsquo;Who's afeard? Who's afeard?&amp;rsquo; Another
one jumped up, excited, with blazing eyes, sent out a sting of unattached
curses and sat down quietly. Two men discussed familiarly, striking one
another's breast in turn, to clinch arguments. Three others, with their
heads in a bunch, spoke all together with a confidential air, and at the
top of their voices. It was a stormy chaos of speech where intelligible
fragments tossing, struck the ear. One could hear: -- &amp;lsquo;In the
last ship&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Who cares? Try it on any one of us if
-- .&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Knock under&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Not a hand's
turn&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;He says he is all right&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I
always thought&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Never mind.....&amp;rsquo; Donkin,
crouching

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 95</TT>

<P>all in a heap against the bowsprit, hunched his shoulder-blades as high
as his ears, and hanging a peaked nose, resembled a sick vulture with ruffled
plumes. Belfast, straddling his legs, had a face red with yelling, and
with arms thrown up, figured a Maltese cross. The two Scandinavians, in
a corner, had the dumbfounded and distracted aspect of men gazing at a
cataclysm. And, beyond the light, Singleton stood in the smoke, monumental,
indistinct, with his head touching the beam; like a statue of heroic size
in the gloom of a crypt.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He stepped forward, impassive and big. The noise subsided
like a broken wave: but Belfast cried once more with uplifted arms: --
&amp;lsquo;The man is dying I tell ye!&amp;rsquo; then sat down suddenly
on the hatch and took his head between his hands. All looked at Singleton,
gazing upwards from the deck staring out of dark corners, or turning their
heads with curious glances. They were expectant and appeased as if that
old man, who looked at no one, had possessed the secret of their uneasy
indignations and desires, a sharper vision, a clearer knowledge. And indeed
standing there amongst them, he had the uninterested appearance of one
who had seen multitudes of ships, had listened many times to voices such
as theirs, had already seen all that could happen on the wide seas. They
heard his voice rumble in his broad chest as though the words had been
rolling towards them out of a rugged past. &amp;lsquo;What do you want
to do?&amp;rsquo; he asked. No one answered. Only Knowles muttered -- &amp;lsquo;Aye,
aye,&amp;rsquo; and somebody said low: -- &amp;lsquo;It's a bloomin' shame.&amp;rsquo;
He waited made a contemptuous gesture. -- &amp;lsquo;I have seen rows aboard
ship before some of you were born,&amp;rsquo; he said slowly, &amp;lsquo;for
something or nothing; but never for such a thing. -- &amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;The
man is dying, I tell ye,&amp;rsquo; repeated Belfast woefully, sitting
at Singleton's feet. -- &amp;lsquo;And a black fellow, too,&amp;rsquo;
went on the old seaman, &amp;lsquo;I have seen them die like flies.&amp;rsquo;
He stopped, thoughtful, as if trying to recollect gruesome things, details
of horrors, hecatombs of niggers. They looked at him fascinated. He was
old enough to remember slavers, bloody mutinies, pirates perhaps; who could
tell through what violences and terrors he had lived! What would he say?
He said: -- &amp;lsquo;You can't help him; die he must.&amp;rsquo; He made
another pause. His moustache and beard stirred. He chewed words, mumbled
behind white hairs; incomprehensible and exciting, like an

<P>oracle behind a veil..... -- &amp;lsquo;Stop ashore -- sick. -- Instead
-- bringing all this head wind. Afraid. The sea will have her own. -- Die
in the sight of land. Always so. They know it -- long passage -- more days,
more dollars. -- you keep quiet. -- What do you want? Can't help him.&amp;rsquo;
He seemed to wake up from a dream. &amp;lsquo;You can't help your selves,&amp;rsquo;
he said austerely, &amp;lsquo;Skipper's no fool. He has something in his
mind. Look out -- I say! I know 'em!&amp;rsquo; With eyes fixed in front
he turned his head from right to left, from left to right, as if inspecting
a long row of astute skippers. -- &amp;lsquo;He said 'e would brain me!&amp;rsquo;
cried Donkin in a heartrending tone. Singleton peered downwards with puzzled
attention, as though he couldn't find him. -- &amp;lsquo;Damn you!&amp;rsquo;
he said vaguely, giving it up. He radiated unspeakable wisdom, hard unconcern,
the chilling air of resignation. Round him all the listeners felt themselves
somehow completely enlightened by their disappointment, and, mute, they
lolled about with the careless ease of men who can discern perfectly the
irremediable aspect of their existence. He, profound and unconscious, waved
his arm once, and strode out on deck without another word.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Belfast was lost in a round-eyed meditation. One or two
vaulted heavily into upper berths, and, once there, sighed; others dived
head first inside lower bunks -- swift, and turning round instantly upon
themselves, like animals going into lairs. The grating of a knife scraping
burnt clay was heard. Knowles grinned no more. Davies said, in a tone of
ardent conviction: -- &amp;lsquo;Then our skipper's looney.&amp;rsquo;
Archie muttered: -- &amp;lsquo;My faith! we haven't heard the last of it
yet!&amp;rsquo; Four bells were struck. -- &amp;lsquo;Half our watch below
is gone!&amp;rsquo; cried Knowles in alarm, then reflected, &amp;lsquo;Well,
two hours sleep is something towards a rest,&amp;rsquo; he observed consolingly.
Some already pretended to slumber; and Charley, sound asleep, suddenly
said a few slurred words in an arbitrary, blank voice. -- &amp;lsquo;This
blamed boy has worrums!&amp;rsquo; commented Knowles from under a blanket,
and in a learned manner. Belfast got up and approached Archie's berth.
-- &amp;lsquo;we pulled him out,&amp;rsquo; he whispered sadly. -- &amp;lsquo;And
now we will have to chuck him overboard,&amp;rsquo; went on Belfast, whose
lower lip trembled. -- &amp;lsquo;Chuck what?&amp;rsquo; asked Archie.
-- &amp;lsquo;Poor Jimmy,&amp;rsquo; breathed out Belfast. -- &amp;lsquo;He
be blowed!&amp;rsquo; said Archie with untruthful brutality, and sat up
in his

<P>bunk;&amp;lsquo;It's all through him. If it hadn't been for me, there
would have been murder on board this ship!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Tain't
his fault, is it?&amp;rsquo; argued Belfast, in a murmur; &amp;lsquo;I've
put him to bed....and he ain't no heavier than an empty beef-cask,&amp;rsquo;
he added, with tears in his eyes. Archie looked at him steadily, then turned
his nose to the ship's side with determination. Belfast wandered about
as though he had lost his way in the dim forecastle, and nearly fell over
Donkin. He contemplated him from on high for awhile. &amp;lsquo;Ain't ye
going to turn in?&amp;rsquo; he asked. Donkin looked up hopelessly. --
&amp;lsquo;That black-'earted Scotch son of a thief kicked me!&amp;rsquo;
he whispered from the floor, in a tone of utter desolation. -- &amp;lsquo;And
a good job, too!&amp;rsquo; said Belfast, still very depressed; &amp;lsquo;You
were as near hanging as damn-it to-night, sonny. Don't you play any of
your murthering games around my Jimmy! You haven't pulled him out. You
just mind! 'Cos if I start to kick you&amp;rsquo; -- he brightened up a
bit -- &amp;lsquo;if I start to kick you, it will be Yankee fashion --
to break something!&amp;rsquo; He tapped lightly with his knuckles the
top of the bowed head. &amp;lsquo;You moind, me bhoy!&amp;rsquo; he concluded,
cheerily. Donkin let it pass. -- &amp;lsquo;Will they split on me?&amp;rsquo;
he asked, with pained anxiety. -- &amp;lsquo;Who -- split?&amp;rsquo; hissed
Belfast, coming back a step. &amp;lsquo;I would split your nose this minyt
if I hadn't Jimmy to look after! Who d'ye think we are?&amp;rsquo; Donkin
rose and watched Belfast's back lurch through the doorway. On all sides
men slept, breathing calmly. He seemed to draw courage and fury from the
peace around him. Venomous and thin-faced, he glared from the ample misfit
of borrowed clothes as if looking for something he could smash. His heart
leaped wildly in his narrow chest. They slept! He wanted to wring necks,
gouge eyes, spit on faces. He shook a dirty pair of meagre fists at the
smoking lights. &amp;lsquo;Ye're no men!&amp;rsquo; he cried, in a deadened
tone. No one moved. &amp;lsquo;Yer 'aven't the pluck of a mouse!&amp;rsquo;
His voice rose to a husky screech. Wamibo blinked, uncomprehending but
interested. Donkin sat down heavily; he blew with force through quivering
nostrils, he ground and snapped his teeth, and, with the chin pressed hard
against the breast, he seemed busy gnawing his way through it, as if to
get at the heart within.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning the ship, beginning another day of her wandering
life, had an aspect of sumptuous freshness, like the spring-time of the
earth. The washed decks glistened in a long clear stretch; the oblique
sunlight struck the yellow brasses in dazzling splashes, darted over the
polished rods in lines of gold, and the single drops of salt water forgotten
here and there along the rail were as limpid as drops of dew, and sparkled
more than scattered diamonds. The sails slept hushed by a gentle breeze.
The sun, rising lonely and splendid in the blue sky, saw a solitary ship
gliding close-hauled on the blue sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The men pressed three deep abreast of the mainmast and
opposite the cabin-door. They shuffled, pushed, had an irresolute mien
and stolid faces. At every slight movement Knowles lurched heavily on his
short leg. Donkin glided behind backs, restless and anxious, like a man
looking for an ambush. Captain Allistoun came out suddenly. He walked to
and fro before the front. He was grey, slight, alert, shabby in the sunshine,
and as hard as adamant. He had his right hand in the side-pocket of his
jacket, and also something heavy in there that made folds all down that
side. One of the seamen cleared his throat ominously. -- &amp;lsquo;I haven't
till now found fault with you men,&amp;rsquo; said the master, stopping
short. He faced them with his worn, steely gaze, that by an universal illusion
looked straight into every individual pair of the twenty pairs of eyes
before his face. At his back, Mr. baker, bloomy and bull-necked, grunted
low; Mr. Creighton, fresh as paint, had rosy cheeks and a ready, resolute
bearing. &amp;lsquo;And I don't now,&amp;rsquo; continued the master; &amp;lsquo;but
I am here to drive this ship and keep every man-jack aboard of her up to
the mark. If you knew your work as well as I do mine, there would be no
trouble. You've been braying in the dark about "See to-morrow morning!"
Well, you see me now. What do you want?&amp;rsquo; He waited, stepping
quickly to and fro, giving them searching glances. What did they want?
Jimmy was forgotten; no one thought of him, alone forward in his cabin,
fighting great shadows, clinging to brazen lies, chuckling painfully over
his transparent deceptions. No, not Jimmy; he was more forgotten than if
he had been dead. They wanted great things. And suddenly all the simple
words they knew seemed to be lost for ever

<P>

<P><TT>Page 99</TT>

<P>in the immensity of their vague and burning desire. They knew what they
wanted, but they could not find anything worth saying. They stirred on
one spot, swinging, at the end of muscular arms, big tarry hands with crooked
fingers. A murmur died out. -- &amp;lsquo;What is it -- food?&amp;rsquo;
asked the master, &amp;lsquo;you know the stores had been spoiled off the
Cape.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;We know that, sir,&amp;rsquo; said a bearded
shell-back in the front rank -- &amp;lsquo;Work too hard -- eh? Too much
for your strength?&amp;rsquo; he asked again. There was an offended silence.
-- &amp;lsquo;We don't want to go shorthanded, sir,&amp;rsquo; began at
last Davies in a wavering voice, &amp;lsquo;and this 'ere black -- ....
&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Enough!&amp;rsquo; cried the master. He stood
scanning them for a moment, then walking a few steps this way and that
began to storm at them coldly, in gusts violent and cutting like the gales
of those icy seas that had known his youth. -- &amp;lsquo;Tell you what's
the matter? Too big for your boots. Think yourselves damn good men. Know
half your work. Do half your duty. Think it too much. If you did ten times
as much it wouldn't be enough.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;We did our best
by her, sir,&amp;rsquo; cried some one with shaky exasperation. -- &amp;lsquo;Your
best,&amp;rsquo; stormed on the master; &amp;lsquo;You here a lot on shore,
don't you? They don't tell you there your best isn't much to boast of.
I tell you -- your best is no better than bad. You can do no more? No,
I know, and say nothing. But you stop your caper or I will stop it for
you! Stop it!&amp;rsquo; He shook a finger at the crowd. &amp;lsquo;As
to that man,&amp;rsquo; he raised his voice very much; &amp;lsquo;as to
that man, if he puts his nose out on deck without my leave I will clap
him in irons. There!&amp;rsquo; The cook heard him forward, ran out of
the galley lifting his arms, horrified, unbelieving, amazed, and ran in
again. There was a moment of profound silence during which a bow-legged
seaman, stepping aside, expectorated decorously into the scupper. &amp;lsquo;There
is another thing,&amp;rsquo; said the master calmly. He made a quick stride
and with a swing took an iron belaying-pin out of his pocket. &amp;lsquo;This!&amp;rsquo;
His movement was so unexpected and sudden that the crowd stepped back.
He gazed fixedly at their faces, and some at once put on a surprised air
as though they had never seen a belaying-pin before. He held it up. &amp;lsquo;This
is my affair. I don't ask you any questions, but you all know it; it has
got to go where it came from.&amp;rsquo; His eyes became angry. The crowd
stirred uneasily. They looked away from the piece of iron, they appeared
shy, they were

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 100</TT>

<P>embarrassed and shocked as though it had been something horrid, scandalous,
or indelicate, that in common decency should not have been flourished like
this in broad daylight. The master watched them attentively. &amp;lsquo;Donkin,&amp;rsquo;
he called out in a short, sharp tone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin dodged behind one, then behind another, but they
looked over their shoulders and moved aside. The ranks kept on opening
before him, closing behind, till at last he appeared alone before the master
as though he had come up through the deck. Captain Allistoun moved close
to him. They were much of a size, and at short range the master exchanged
a deadly glance with the beady eyes. They wavered, -- &amp;lsquo;You know
this,&amp;rsquo; asked the master. -- &amp;lsquo;No, I don't,&amp;rsquo;
answered the other with cheeky trepidation. -- &amp;lsquo;You are a cur.
Take it,&amp;rsquo;ordered the master. Donkin's arms seemed glued to his
thighs; he stood, e yes front, as if drawn on parade. &amp;lsquo;Take it,&amp;rsquo;
repeated the master, and stepped closer; they breathed on one another.
&amp;lsquo;Take it,&amp;rsquo; said Captain Allistoun again, making a menacing
gesture. Donkin tore away one arm from his side. -- &amp;lsquo;Vy hare
yer down hon me?&amp;rsquo; he mumbled with effort as if his mouth had
been full of dough. -- &amp;lsquo;If you don't.... &amp;rsquo; began the
master. Donkin snatched at the pin as though his intention had been to
run away with it, and remained stock still holding it like a candle. &amp;lsquo;Put
it back where you took it from,&amp;rsquo; said Captain Allistoun, looking
at him fiercely. Donkin stepped back opening wide eyes. &amp;lsquo;Go,
you blackguard, or I will make you,&amp;rsquo; cried the master, driving
him slowly backwards by a menacing advance. He dodged, and with the dangerous
iron tried to guard his head from a threatening fist. Mr. Baker ceased
grunting for a moment. -- &amp;lsquo;Good! By Jove,&amp;rsquo; murmured
appreciatively Mr. Creighton in the tone of a connoisseur. -- &amp;lsquo;Don't
tech me,&amp;rsquo; snarled Donkin, backing away. -- &amp;lsquo;Then go.
Go faster.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Don't yer 'it me.....I will pull yer
hup afore the magistryt.....I'll show yer hup.&amp;rsquo; Captain Allistoun
made a long stride and Donkin, turning his back fairly, ran off a little,
then stopped and over his shoulder showed yellow teeth. -- &amp;lsquo;Further
on, fore-rigging,&amp;rsquo; urged the master, pointing with his arm. --
&amp;lsquo;Hare yer goin' to stand by and see me bullied,&amp;rsquo; screamed
Donkin at the silent crowd that watched him. Captain Allistoun walked at
him smartly. He started off again with a leap, dashed at the fore-rigging,

<P>rammed the pin into its hole violently . &amp;lsquo;I will be heven
with yer yet,&amp;rsquo; he screamed at the ship at large and vanished
beyond the foremast. Captain Allistoun spun round and walked back aft with
a composed face, as though he had already forgotten the scene. Men moved
out of his way. He looked at no one. -- &amp;lsquo;That will do, Mr. Baker.
Send the watch below,&amp;rsquo; he said quietly. &amp;lsquo;And you men
try to walk straight for the future,&amp;rsquo; he added in a calm voice.
He looked pensively for a while at the of the impressed and retreating
crowd. &amp;lsquo;Breakfast, steward,&amp;rsquo; he called in a tone of
relief through the cabin door. -- &amp;lsquo;I didn't like to see you --
Ou gh! -- give that pin to that chap, sir,&amp;rsquo; observed Mr. Baker;
&amp;lsquo;he could have bust -- Ough! -- bust your head like an eggshell
with it.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;O! he!&amp;rsquo; muttered the master
absently. &amp;lsquo;Queer lot,&amp;rsquo; he went on in a low voice. &amp;lsquo;I
suppose it's all right now. Can never tell tho', nowadays, with such a....years
ago; I was a young master then -- one China voyage I had a mutiny; real
mutiny, Baker. Different men tho'. I knew what they wanted: they wanted
to broach cargo and get at the liquor. Very simple.....We knocked them
about for two days, and when they had enough -- gentle as lambs. Good crew.
And a smart trip I made.&amp;rsquo; He glanced aloft at the yards braced
sharp up. &amp;lsquo;Head wind day after day,&amp;rsquo; he exclaimed bitterly.
&amp;lsquo;Will we never get a decent slant this passage?&amp;rsquo; --
&amp;lsquo;Ready, sir,&amp;rsquo; said the steward appearing before them
as if by magic and with a stained napkin in his hand. -- &amp;lsquo;Ah!
All right. Come along Mr. Baker -- it's late -- with all this nonsense.&amp;rsquo;
