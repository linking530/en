<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker, chief mate of the ship <I>Narcissus</I>, stepped
in one stride out of his lighted cabin into the darkness of the quarter-deck.
Above his head, on the break of the poop, the night-watchman rang a double
stroke. It was nine o'clock. Mr. Baker, speaking up to the man above him,
asked: -- &amp;lsquo;Are all the hands aboard, Knowles?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man limped down the ladder, then said reflectively:
--

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I think so, sir. All our old chaps are there,
and a lot of new men has come.....They must be all there.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Tell the boatswain to send all hands aft,&amp;rsquo;
went on Mr. Baker; &amp;lsquo;and tell one of the youngsters to bring a
good lamp here. I want to muster our crowd.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The main deck was dark aft, but halfway from forward, through
the open doors of the forecastle, two streaks of brilliant light cut the
shadow of the quiet night that lay upon the ship. A hum of voices was heard
there, while port and starboard, in the illuminated doorways, silhouettes
of moving men appeared for a moment, very black, without relief, like figures
cut out of sheet tin. The ship was ready for sea. The carpenter had driven
in the last wedge of the main-hatch battens, and, throwing down his maul,
had wiped his face with great deliberation, just on the stroke of five.
The decks had been swept, the windlass oiled and made ready to heave up

<P>the anchor; the big tow-rope lay in long bights along one side of the
main deck, with one end carried up and hung over the bows, in readiness
for the tug that would come paddling and hissing noisily, hot and smoky,
in the limpid, cool quietness of the early morning. The captain was ashore,
where he had been engaging some new hands to make up his full crew; and,
the work of the day over, the ship's officers had kept out of the way,
glad of a little breathing-time. Soon after dark the few liberty-men and
the new hands began to arrive in shore-boats rowed by white-clad Asiatics,
who clamoured fiercely for payment before coming alongside the gangway-ladder.
The feverish and shrill babble of Eastern language struggled against the
masterful tones of tipsy seamen, who argued against brazen claims and dishonest
hopes by profane shouts. The resplendent and bestarred peace of the East
was torn into squalid tatters by howls of rage and shrieks of lament raised
over sums ranging from five annas to half a rupee; and every soul afloat
in Bombay Harbour became aware that the new hands were joining the <I>Narcissus</I>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually the distracting noise had subsided. The boats
came no longer in splashing clusters of three or four together, but dropped
alongside singly, in a subdued buzz of expostulation cut short by a &amp;lsquo;Not
a piece more! You go to the devil!&amp;rsquo; from some man staggering
up the accommodation-ladder -- a dark figure, with a long bag poised on
the shoulder. In the forecastle the newcomers, upright and swaying amongst
corded boxes and bundles of bedding, made friends with the old hands, who
sat one above another in the two tiers of bunks, gazing at their future
shipmates with glances critical but friendly. The two forecastle lamps
were turned up high, and shed an intense hard glare; shore-going hard hats
were pushed far on the backs of heads, or rolled about on the deck amongst
the chain-cables; white collars, undone, stuck out on each side of red
faces; big arms in white sleeves gesticulated; the growling voices hummed
steady amongst bursts of laughter and hoarse calls. &amp;lsquo;Here, sonny,
take that bunk!.....Don't you do it!.....What's your last ship?.....I know
her......Three years ago, in Puget Sound....This here berth leaks, I tell
you!....Come on; give us a chance to swing that chest!.... Did you bring
a bottle, any of

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 3</TT>

<P>you shore toffs?.... Give us a bit of 'baccy....I know her; her skipper
drank himself to death....He was a dandy boy!....Liked his lotion inside,
he did!....No!....Hold your row, you chaps!.... I tell you, you came on
board a hooker, where they get their money's worth out of poor Jack, by
-- !....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little fellow, called Craik and nicknamed Belfast, abused
the ship violently, romancing on principle, just to give the new hands
something to think over. Archie, sitting aslant on his sea-chest, kept
his knees out of the way, and pushed the needle steadily through a white
patch in a pair of blue trousers. Men in black jackets and stand-up collars,
mixed with men bare-footed, bare-armed, with coloured shirts open on hairy
chests, pushed against one another in the middle of the forecastle. The
group swayed, reeled, turning upon itself with the motion of a scrimmage,
in a haze of tobacco smoke. All were speaking together, swearing at every
second word. A Russian Finn, wearing a yellow shirt with pink stripes,
stared upwards, dreamy-eyed, from under a mop of tumbled hair. Two young
giants with smooth, baby faces -- two Scandinavians -- helped each other
to spread their bedding, silent, and smiling placidly at the tempest of
good-humoured and meaningless curses. Old Singleton, the oldest able seaman
in the ship, sat apart on the deck right under the lamps, stripped to the
waist, tattooed like a cannibal chief all over his powerful chest and enormous
biceps. Between the blue and red patterns his white skin gleamed like satin;
his bare back was propped against the heel of the bowsprit, and he held
a book at arm's length before his big, sunburnt face. With his spectacles
and a venerable white beard, he resembled a learned and savage patriarch,
the incarnation of barbarian wisdom serene in the blasphemous turmoil of
the world. He was intensely absorbed, and, as he turned the pages an expression
of grave surprise would pass over his rugged features. He was reading &amp;lsquo;Pelham.&amp;rsquo;
The popularity of Bulwer Lytton in the forecastles of Southern-going ships
is a wonderful and bizarre phenomenon. What ideas do his polished and so
curiously insincere sentences awaken in the simple minds of the big children
who people those dark and wandering places of the earth? What meaning can
their rough, inexperienced souls find in the elegant verbiage of his pages?
What excitement? -- what forgetfulness? --

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 4</TT>

<P>what appeasement? Mystery! Is it the fascination of the incomprehensible?
-- is it the charm of the impossible? Or are those beings who exist beyond
the pale of life stirred by his tales as by an enigmatical disclosure of
a resplendent world that exists within the frontier of infamy and filth,
within that border of dirt and hunger, of misery and dissipation, that
comes down on all sides to the water's edge of the incorruptible ocean,
and is the only thing they know of life, the only thing they see of surrounding
land -- those life-long prisoners of the sea? Mystery?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singleton, who had sailed to the southward since the age
of twelve, who in the last forty-five years had lived (as we had calculated
from his papers) no more than forty months ashore -- old Singleton, who
boasted, with the mild composure of long years well spent, that generally
from the day he was paid off from one ship till the day he shipped in another
he seldom was in a condition to distinguish daylight -- old Singleton sat
unmoved in the clash of voices and cries, spelling through &amp;lsquo;Pelham&amp;rsquo;
with slow labour, and lost in an absorption profound enough to resemble
a trance. He breathed regularly. Every time he turned the book in his enormous
and blackened hands the muscles of his big white arms rolled slightly under
the smooth skin. Hidden by the white moustache, his lips, stained with
tobacco-juice that trickled down the long beard, moved in inward whisper.
His bleared eyes gazed fixedly from behind the glitter of black-rimmed
glasses. Opposite to him, and on a level with his face, the ship's cat
sat on the barrel of the windlass in the pose of a crouching chimera, blinking
its green eyes at its old friend. It seemed to meditate a leap on to the
old man's lap over the bent back of the ordinary seaman who sat at Singleton's
feet. Young Charley was lean and long-necked. The ridge of his backbone
made a chain of small hills under the old shirt. His face of a street-boy
-- a face precocious, sagacious, and ironic, with deep downward folds on
each side of the thin, wide mouth -- hung low over his bony knees. He was
learning to make a lanyard knot with a bit of an old rope. Small drops
of perspiration stood out on his bulging forehead; he sniffed strongly
from time to time, glancing out of the corners of his restless eyes at
the old seaman, who took no notice of the puzzled youngster muttering at
his work.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise increased. Little Belfast seemed, in the heavy
heat of the forecastle, to boil with facetious fury. His eyes danced; in
the crimson of his face, comical as a mask, the mouth yawned black, with
strange grimaces. Facing him, a half-undressed man held his sides, and
throwing his head back, laughed with wet eyelashes. Others stared with
amazed eyes. Men sitting doubled up in the upper bunks smoked short pipes,
swinging bare brown feet above the heads of those who, sprawling below
on sea-chests, listened, smiling stupidly or scornfully. Over the white
rims of berths stuck out heads with blinking eyes; but the bodies were
lost in the gloom of those places, that resembled narrow niches for coffins
in a white-washed and lighted mortuary. Voices buzzed louder. Archie, with
compressed lips, drew himself in, seemed to shrink into a smaller space,
and sewed steadily, industrious and dumb. Belfast shrieked like an inspired
Dervish: -- &amp;lsquo;....So I seez to him, boys, seez I, "Beggin' yer
pardon, sorr," seez I to that second mate of that steamer -- "beggin' your-r-r
pardon, sorr, the Board of Trade must 'ave been drunk when they granted
you your certificate!" "What do you say, you -- !" seez he, comin' at me
like a mad bull....all in his white clothes; and I up with my tarpot and
capsizes it all over his blamed lovely face and his lovely jacket......
"Take that!" seez I. "I am a sailor, anyhow, you nosing, skipper-licking,
useless, sooperfloos bridge-stanchion, you! That's the kind of man I am!"
shouts I.....You should have seed him skip, boys! Drowned, blind with tar,
he was! So....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Don't 'ee believe him! He never upset no tar;
I was there!&amp;rsquo; shouted somebody. The two Norwegians sat on a chest
side by side, alike and placid, resembling a pair of love-birds on a perch,
and with round eyes stared innocently; but the Russian Finn, in the racket
of explosive shouts and rolling laughter, remained motionless, limp and
dull, like a deaf man without a backbone. Near him Archie smiled at his
needle. A broad-chested, slow-eyed newcomer spoke deliberately to Belfast
during an exhausted lull in the noise: -- &amp;lsquo;I wonder any of the
mates here are alive yet with such a chap as you on board! I concloode
they ain't that bad now, if you had the taming of them, sonny.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Not bad! Not bad!&amp;rsquo; screamed Belfast.
&amp;lsquo;If it wasn't for us sticking together.....Not bad! They ain't
never bad when they ain't got a

<P>chawnce, blast their black 'arts.....&amp;rsquo; He foamed, whirling
his arms, then suddenly grinned and, taking a tablet of black tobacco out
of his pocket, bit a piece off with a funny show of ferocity. Another new
hand -- a man with shifty eyes and a yellow hatchet face, who had been
listening open-mouthed in the shadow of the midship locker -- observed
in a squeaky voice: -- &amp;lsquo;Well, it's a 'omeward trip, anyhow. Bad
or good, I can do it hall on my 'ed -- s'long as I get 'ome. And I can
look after my rights! I will show 'em!&amp;rsquo; All the heads turned
towards him. Only the ordinary seaman and the cat took no notice. He stood
with arms akimbo, a little fellow with white eyelashes, He looked as if
he had known all the degradations and all the furies. He looked as if he
had been cuffed, kicked, rolled in the mud; he looked as if he had been
scratched, spat upon, pelted with unmentionable filth....and he smiled
with a sense of security at the faces around. His ears were bending down
under the weight of his battered hard hat. The torn tails of his black
coat flapped in fringes about the calves of his legs. He unbuttoned the
only two buttons that remained and every one saw he had no shirt under
it. It was his deserved misfortune that those rags which nobody could possibly
be supposed to own looked on him as if they had been stolen. His neck was
long and thin; his eyelids were red; rare hairs hung about his jaws; his
shoulders were peaked and drooped like the broken wings of a bird; all
his left side was caked with mud which showed that he had lately slept
in a wet ditch. He had saved his inefficient carcass from violent destruction
by running away from an American ship where, in a moment of forgetful folly,
he had dared to engage himself; and he had knocked about for a fortnight
ashore in the native quarter, cadging for drinks, starving, sleeping on
rubbish-heaps, wandering in sunshine: a startling visitor from a world
of nightmares. He stood repulsive and smiling in the sudden silence. This
clean white forecastle was his refuge; the place where he could be lazy;
where he could wallow, and lie and eat -- and curse the food he ate; where
he could display his talents for shirking work, for cheating, for cadging;
where he could find surely some one to wheedle and some one to bully --
and where he would be paid for doing all this. They all knew him. Is there
a spot on earth where such a man is unknown, an ominous survival testifying
to the eternal fitness of

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 7</TT>

<P>lies and impudence? A taciturn long-armed shellback, with hooked fingers,
who had been lying on his back smoking, turned in his bed to examine him
dispassionately, then, over his head, sent a long jet of clear saliva towards
the door. They all knew him! He was the man that cannot steer, that cannot
splice, that dodges the work on dark nights; that, aloft, holds on frantically
with both arms and legs, and swears at the wind, the sleet, the darkness;
the man who curses the sea while others work. The man who is the last out
and the first in when all hands are called. The man who can't do most things
and won't do the rest. The pet of philanthropists and self-seeking landlubbers.
The sympathetic and deserving creature that knows all about his rights,
but knows nothing of courage, of endurance, and of the unexpressed faith,
of the unspoken loyalty that knits together a ship's company. The independent
offspring of the ignoble freedom of the slums full of disdain and hate
for the austere servitude of the sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some one cried at him: &amp;lsquo;What's your name?&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Donkin,&amp;rsquo; he said, looking round with cheerful effrontery.
-- &amp;lsquo;What are you?&amp;rsquo; asked another voice. -- &amp;lsquo;Why,
a sailor like you, old man,&amp;rsquo; he replied, in a tone that meant
to be hearty but was impudent. -- &amp;lsquo;Blamme if you don't look a
blamed sight worse than a broken-down fireman,&amp;rsquo; was the comment
in a convinced mutter. Charley lifted his head and piped in a cheeky voice:
&amp;lsquo;He is a man and a sailor&amp;rsquo; -- then wiping his nose
with the back of his hand bent down industriously over his bit of rope.
A few laughed. others stared doubtfully. The ragged newcomer was indignant.
-- &amp;lsquo;That's a fine way to welcome a chap into a fo'c'sle,&amp;rsquo;
he snarled. &amp;lsquo;Are you men or a lot of 'artless cannybals?&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Don't take your shirt off for a word, shipmate,&amp;rsquo;
called out Belfast, jumping up in front, fiery, menacing, and friendly
at the same time. -- &amp;lsquo;Is that 'ere bloke blind?&amp;rsquo; asked
the indomitable scarecrow, looking right and left with affected surprise.
&amp;lsquo;Can't 'ee see I 'aven't got no shirt?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held both his arms out crosswise and shook the rags
that hung over his bones with dramatic effect.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;'Cos why?&amp;rsquo; he continued very loud.
&amp;lsquo;The bloody Yankees been tryin' to jump my guts hout 'cos I stood
up for my rights like a good'un. I ham a Henglishman, I ham. They set upon
me an' I 'ad to run. That's why. A'n't yer never seed a man 'ard up? Yah!

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 8</TT>

<P>What kind of blamed ship is this? I'm dead broke. I 'aven't got nothink.
No bag, no bed, no blanket, no shirt -- not a bloomin' rag but what I stand
in. But I 'ad the 'art to stand hup agin' them Yankees. 'As any of you
'art enough to spare a pair of old pants for a chum?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew how to conquer the naive instincts of that crowd.
In a moment they gave him their compassion, jocularly, contemptuously,
or surlily; and at first it took the shape of a blanket thrown at him as
he stood there with the white skin of his limbs showing his human kinship
through the black fantasy of his rags. Then a pair of old shoes fell at
his muddy feet. With a cry: -- &amp;lsquo;From under,&amp;rsquo; a rolled-up
pair of trousers, heavy with tar stains, struck him on the shoulder. The
gust of their benevolence sent a wave of sentimental pity through their
doubting hearts. They were touched by their own readiness to alleviate
a shipmate's misery. Voices cried: -- &amp;lsquo;We will fit you out, old
man.&amp;rsquo; Murmurs: &amp;lsquo;Never seed seech a hard case.....Poor
beggar..... I've got an old singlet.....Will that be of any use to you?....
Take it, matey.....&amp;rsquo; Those friendly murmurs filled the forecastle.
He pawed around with his naked foot, gathering the things in a heap and
looked about for more. Unemotional Archie perfunctorily contributed to
the pile an old cloth cap with the peak torn off. Old Singleton, lost in
the serene regions of fiction, read on unheeding. Charley, pitiless with
the wisdom of youth, squeaked: -- &amp;lsquo;If you want brass buttons
for your new unyforms I've got two for you.&amp;rsquo; The filthy object
of universal charity shook his fist at the youngster. -- &amp;lsquo;I'll
make you keep this 'ere fo'c'sle clean, young feller,&amp;rsquo; he snarled
viciously. &amp;lsquo;Never you fear. I will learn you to be civil to an
able seaman, you hignorant hass.&amp;rsquo; He glared harmfully, but saw
Singleton shut his book, and his little beady eyes began to roam from berth
to berth. -- &amp;lsquo;Take that bunk by the door there -- it's pretty
fair,&amp;rsquo; suggested Belfast. So advised, he gathered the gifts at
his feet, pressed them in a bundle against his breast, then looked cautiously
at the Russian Finn, who stood on one side with an unconscious gaze, contemplating,
perhaps, one of those weird visions that haunt the men of his race. &amp;lsquo;Get
out of my road, Dutchy,&amp;rsquo; said the victim of Yankee brutality.
The Finn did not move -- did not hear. &amp;lsquo;Get out, blast ye,&amp;rsquo;
shouted the other, shoving him aside with his elbow. &amp;lsquo;Get out,
you blanked

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 9</TT>

<P>deaf and dumb fool. Get out.&amp;rsquo; The man staggered, recovered
himself, and gazed at the speaker in silence. -- &amp;lsquo;Those damned
furriners should be kept hunder,&amp;rsquo; opined the amiable Donkin to
the forecastle. &amp;lsquo;If you don't teach 'em their place they put
on you like hanythink.&amp;rsquo; He flung all his worldly possessions
into the empty bed-place, gauged with another shrewd look the risks of
the proceeding, then leaped up to the Finn, who stood pensive and dull.
-- &amp;lsquo;I'll teach you to swell around,&amp;rsquo; he yelled. &amp;lsquo;I'll
plug your eyes for you, you blooming square-head.&amp;rsquo; Most of the
men were now in their bunks and the two had the forecastle clear to themselves.
The development of the destitute Donkin aroused interest. He danced all
in tatters before the amazed Finn, squaring from a distance at the heavy,
unmoved face. One or two men cried encouragingly: &amp;lsquo;Go it, Whitechapel!&amp;rsquo;
settling themselves luxuriously in their beds to survey the fight. Others
shouted: &amp;lsquo;Shut yer row!....Go an' put yer 'ed in a bag!.... &amp;rsquo;
The hubbub was recommencing. Suddenly many heavy blows struck with a handspike
on the deck above boomed like discharges of small cannon through the forecastle.
Then the boatswain's voice rose outside the door with an authoritative
note in its drawl: -- &amp;lsquo;D'ye hear, below there? Lay aft! Lay aft
to muster all hands!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a moment of surprised stillness. Then the forecastle
floor disappeared under men whose bare feet flopped on the planks as they
sprang clear out of their berths. Caps were rooted for amongst tumbled
blankets. Some, yawning, buttoned waistbands. Half-smoked pipes were knocked
hurriedly against woodwork and stuffed under pillows. Voices growled: --
&amp;lsquo;What's up?....Is there no rest for us?&amp;rsquo; Donkin yelped:
-- &amp;lsquo;If that's the way of this ship, we'll 'ave to change hall
that..... You leave me alone.....I will soon.....&amp;rsquo; None of the
crowd noticed him. They were lurching in twos and threes through the doors,
after the manner of merchant Jacks who cannot go out of a door fairly,
like mere landsmen. The votary of change followed them. Singleton, struggling
into his jacket, came last, tall and fatherly, bearing high his head of
a weatherbeaten sage on the body of an old athlete. Only Charley remained
alone in the white glare of the empty place, sitting between the two rows
of iron links that stretched into the narrow gloom forward. He pulled hard
at the strands in a hurried

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 10</TT>

<P>endeavour to finish his knot. Suddenly he started up, flung the rope
at the cat, and skipped after the black tom that went off leaping sedately
over chain compressors, with the tail carried stiff and upright, like a
small flag pole.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the glare of the steaming forecastle the serene
purity of the night enveloped the seamen with its soothing breath, with
its tepid breath flowing under the stars that hung countless above the
mastheads in a thin cloud of luminous dust. On the town side the blackness
of the water was streaked with trails of light which undulated gently on
slight ripples, similar to filaments that float rooted to the shore. Rows
of other lights stood away in straight lines as if drawn up on parade between
towering buildings; but on the other side of the harbour sombre hills arched
high their black spines, on which, here and there, the point of a star
resembled a spark fallen from the sky. Far off, Byculla way, the electric
lamps at the dock gates shone on the end of lofty standards with a glow
blinding and frigid like captive ghosts of some evil moons. Scattered all
over the dark polish of the roadstead, the ships at anchor floated in perfect
stillness under the feeble gleam of their riding-lights, looming up, opaque
and bulky, like strange and monumental structures abandoned by men to an
everlasting repose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the cabin door Mr. Baker was mustering the crew.
As they stumbled and lurched along past the mainmast, they could see aft
his round, broad face with a white paper before it, and beside his shoulder
the sleepy head, with dropped eyelids, of the boy, who held, suspended
at the end of his raised arm, the luminous globe of a lamp. Even before
the shuffle of naked soles had ceased along the decks, the mate began to
call over the names. He called distinctly in a serious tone befitting this
roll-call to unquiet loneliness, to inglorious and obscure struggle, or
to the more trying endurance of small privations and wearisome duties.
As the chief mate read out a name, one of the men would answer: &amp;lsquo;Yes,
sir!&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Here!&amp;rsquo; and, detaching himself from
the shadowy mob of heads visible above the blackness of starboard bulwarks,
would step barefooted into the circle of light, and in two noiseless strides
pass into the shadows on the port side of the quarter-deck. They answered
in divers tones: in thick mutters, in clear, ringing voices; and some,
as if the whole thing had been an outrage on their feelings, used

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 11</TT>

<P>an injured intonation: for discipline is not ceremonious in merchant
ships, where the sense of hierarchy is weak, and where all feel themselves
equal before the unconcerned immensity of the sea and the exacting appeal
of the work.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker read on steadily: -- &amp;lsquo;Hanssen -- Campbell
-- Smith -- Wamibo. Now, then, Wamibo. Why don't you answer? Always got
to call your name twice.&amp;rsquo; The Finn emitted at last an uncouth
grunt, and, stepping out, passed through the patch of light, weird and
gaudy, with the face of a man marching through a dream. The mate went on
faster: -- &amp;lsquo;Craik -- Singleton -- Donkin.... O Lord!&amp;rsquo;
he involuntarily ejaculated as the incredibly dilapidated figure appeared
in the light. It stopped; it uncovered pale gums and long, upper teeth
in a malevolent grin. -- &amp;lsquo;Is there anything wrong with me, Mister
Mate?&amp;rsquo; it asked, with a flavour of insolence in the forced simplicity
of its tone. On both sides of the deck subdued titters were heard. -- &amp;lsquo;That'll
do. Go over,&amp;rsquo; growled Mr. Baker, fixing the new hand with steady
blue eyes. And Donkin vanished suddenly out of the light into the dark
group of mustered men, to be slapped on the back and to hear flattering
whispers. Round him men muttered to one another: -- &amp;lsquo;He ain't
afeard, he'll give sport to 'em, see if he don't....Reg'lar Punch and Judy
show.....Did ye see the mate start at him?....Well! Damme, if I ever!....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last man had gone over, and there was a moment of silence
while the mate peered at his list. -- &amp;lsquo;'Sixteen, seventeen,&amp;rsquo;
he muttered. &amp;lsquo;I am one hand short, bosun,&amp;rsquo; he said
aloud. The big west-countryman at his elbow, swarthy and bearded like a
gigantic Spaniard, said in a rumbling bass: -- &amp;lsquo;There's no one
left forward, sir. I had a look round. He ain't aboard, but he may turn
up before daylight.&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Ay. He may or he may not,&amp;rsquo;
commented the mate;&amp;lsquo;can't make out that last name. It's all a
smudge.....That will do, men. Go below.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The indistinct and motionless group stirred, broke up,
began to move forward.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Wait!&amp;rsquo; cried a deep, ringing voice.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All stood still. Mr. Baker, who had turned away yawning,
spun round open-mouthed. At last, furious, he blurted out: -- &amp;lsquo;What's
this? Who said "Wait"? What....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But he saw a tall figure standing on the rail. It came
down and

<P>

<P><TT>Page 12</TT>

<P>pushed through the crowd, marching with a heavy tread towards the light
on the quarter-deck. Then again the sonorous voice said with insistence:
-- &amp;lsquo;Wait!&amp;rsquo; The lamplight lit up the man's body. He
was tall. His head was away up in the shadows of lifeboats that stood on
skids above the deck. The whites of his eyes and his teeth gleamed distinctly,
but the face was indistinguishable. His hands were big and seemed gloved.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker advanced intrepidly. &amp;lsquo;Who are you?
How dare you... &amp;rsquo; he began.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy, amazed like the rest, raised the light to the
man's face. It was black. A surprised hum -- a faint hum that sounded like
the suppressed mutter of the word &amp;lsquo;Nigger&amp;rsquo; -- ran along
the deck and escaped out into the night. The nigger seemed not to hear.
He balanced himself where he stood in a swagger that marked time. After
a moment he said calmly: -- &amp;lsquo;My name is Wait -- James Wait.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Oh!&amp;rsquo; said Mr. Baker. Then, after a
few seconds of smouldering silence, his temper blazed out. &amp;lsquo;Ah!
Your name is Wait. What of that? What do you want? What do you mean, coming
shouting here?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nigger was calm, cool, towering, superb. The men had
approached and stood behind him in a body. He overtopped the tallest by
a half a head. He said: &amp;lsquo;I belong to the ship.&amp;rsquo; He
enunciated distinctly, with soft precision. The deep, rolling tones of
his voice filled the deck without effort. He was naturally scornful, unaffectedly
condescending, as if from his height of six foot three he had surveyed
all the vastness of human folly and had made up his mind not to be too
hard on it. He went on: -- The captain shipped me this morning. I couldn't
get aboard sooner. I saw you all aft and I came up the ladder, and could
see directly you were mustering the crew. Naturally I called out my name.
I thought you had it on your list, and would understand. You misapprehended.&amp;rsquo;
He stopped short. The folly around him was confounded. He was right as
ever, and as ever ready to forgive. The disdainful tones had ceased, and
breathing heavily, he stood still, surrounded by all these white men. He
held his head up in the glare of the lamp -- a head vigorously modelled
into deep shadows and shining lights -- a head powerful and misshapen with
a tormented and flattened face -- a face pathetic and brutal: the tragic,
the mysterious, the repulsive mask of a nigger's soul.

<P><TT>Page 13</TT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker, recovering his composure, looked at the paper
close. &amp;lsquo;Oh, yes; that's so. All right, Wait. Take your gear forward,&amp;rsquo;
he said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly the nigger's eyes rolled wildly, became all whites.
He put his hand to his side and coughed twice, a cough metallic, hollow,
and tremendously loud; it resounded like two explosions in a vault; the
dome of the sky rang to it, and the iron plates of the ship's bulwarks
seemed to vibrate in unison; then he marched off forward with the others.
The officers lingering by the cabin door could hear him say:&amp;lsquo;Won't
some of you chaps lend a hand with my dunnage? I've got a chest and a bag.&amp;rsquo;
The words, spoken sonorously, with an even intonation, were heard all over
the ship, and the question was put in a manner that made refusal impossible.
The short, quick shuffle of men carrying something heavy went away forward,
but the tall figure of the nigger lingered by the main hatch in a knot
of smaller shapes. Again he was heard asking:&amp;lsquo;Is your cook a
coloured gentleman?&amp;rsquo; Then a disappointed and disapproving &amp;lsquo;Ah!
h'm!&amp;rsquo; was his comment upon the information that the cook happened
to be a mere white man. Yet, as they went all together towards the forecastle,
he condescended to put his head through the galley door and boom out inside
a magnificent &amp;lsquo;Good evening, doctor!&amp;rsquo; that made all
the saucepans ring. In the dim light the cook dozed on the coal locker
in front of the captain's supper. He jumped up as if he had been cut with
a whip, and dashed wildly on deck to see the backs of several men going
away laughing. Afterwards, when talking about that voyage, he used to say:
-- &amp;lsquo;The poor fellow had scared me. I thought I had seen the devil.&amp;rsquo;
The cook had been seven years in the ship with the same captain. He was
a serious-minded man with a wife and three children, whose society he enjoyed
on an average one month out of twelve. When on shore he took his family
to church twice every Sunday. At sea he went to sleep every evening with
his lamp turned full up, a pipe in his mouth, and an open Bible in his
hand. Some one had always to go during the night to put out the light,
take the book from his hand, and the pipe from between his teeth. &amp;lsquo;For&amp;rsquo;
-- Belfast used to say, irritated and complaining -- &amp;lsquo;some night,
you stupid cookie, you'll swallow your ould clay, and we will have no cook.
-- &amp;lsquo;Ah! sonny, I am ready for my Maker's call....wish

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 14</TT>

<P>you all were.&amp;rsquo; the other would answer with a benign serenity
that was altogether imbecile and touching. Belfast outside the galley door
danced with vexation. &amp;lsquo;You holy fool! I don't want you to die,&amp;rsquo;
he howled, looking up with furious, quivering face and tender eyes. &amp;lsquo;What's
the hurry? you blessed wooden-headed ould heretic, the divvle will have
you soon enough. Think of Us....of Us....of Us!&amp;rsquo; And he would
go away, stamping, spitting aside, disgusted and worried; while the other,
stepping out, saucepan in hand, hot, begrimed, and placid, watched with
a superior, cock-sure smile the back of his &amp;lsquo;queer little man&amp;rsquo;
reeling in a rage. They were great friends.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker, lounging over the after-hatch, sniffed the humid
night in the company of the second mate. -- &amp;lsquo;Those West India
niggers run fine and large -- some of them.... Ough!....Don't they? A fine,
big man that, Mr. Creighton. Feel him on a rope. Hey? Ough! I will take
him into my watch, I think.&amp;rsquo; The second mate, a fair gentlemanly
young fellow, with a resolute face and a splended physique, observed quietly
that it was just about what he expected. There could be felt in his tone
some slight bitterness which Mr. Baker very kindly set himself to argue
away. &amp;lsquo;Come, come, young man,&amp;rsquo; he said, grunting between
the words. &amp;lsquo;Come! Don't be too greedy. You had that big Finn
in your watch all the voyage. I will do what's fair. You may have those
two young Scandinavians and I....Ough!....I get the nigger, and will take
that.... Ough! that cheeky costermonger chap in a black frock-coat. I'll
make him....Ough!....make him toe the mark, or my.... Ough!....name isn't
Baker. Ough! Ough! Ough!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He grunted thrice -- ferociously. He had that trick of
grunting so between his words and at the end of sentences. It was a fine,
effective grunt that went well with his menacing utterance, with his heavy,
bull-necked frame, his jerky, rolling gait; with his big, seamed face,
his steady eyes, and sardonic mouth. But its effect had been long discounted
by the men. They liked him; Belfast, who was a favourite, and knew it --
mimicked him, not quite behind his back. Charley -- but with greater caution
-- imitated his walk. Some of his sayings became established daily quotations
in the forecastle. Popularity can go no farther! Besides, all hands were
ready to admit that on a fitting occasion the mate could &amp;lsquo;jump
down a fellow's throat in a reg'lar Western Ocean style.&amp;rsquo;

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 15</TT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he was giving his last orders. &amp;lsquo;Ough!....
You, Knowles! Call all hands at four. I want....Ough!.... to heave short
before the tug comes. Look out for the Captain. I am going to lay down
in my clothes....Ough!....Call me when you see the boat coming. Ough!Ough!....
The old man is sure to have something to say when he comes aboard&amp;rsquo;
he remarked to Creighton. &amp;lsquo;Well, good-night....Ough! A long day
before us to-morrow..... Ough!....Better turn in now. Ough! Ough!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the dark deck a band of light flashed, then a door
slammed, and Mr. Baker was gone into his neat cabin. Young Creighton stood
leaning over the rail, and looked dreamily into the night of the East.
And he saw in it a long country lane, a lane of waving leaves and dancing
sunshine. He saw stirring boughs of old trees outspread, and framing in
their arch the tender, the caressing blueness of an English sky. And through
the arch a girl in a clear dress, smiling under a sunshade, seemed to be
stepping out of the tender sky.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the other end of the ship the forecastle, with only
one lamp burning now, was going to sleep in a dim emptiness traversed by
loud breathings, by sudden short sighs. The double row of berths yawned
black, like graves tenanted by uneasy corpses. Here and there a curtain
of gaudy chintz, half drawn, marked the resting-place of a sybarite. A
leg hung over the edge very white and lifeless. An arm stuck straight out
with a dark palm turned up, and thick fingers half closed. Two light snores,
that did not synchronise quarreled in funny dialogue. Singleton stripped
again -- the old man suffered much from prickly heat -- stood cooling his
back in the doorway, with his arms crossed on his bare and adorned chest.
His head touched the beam of the deck above. The nigger, half undressed,
was busy casting adrift the lashing of his box, and spreading his bedding
in an upper berth. He moved about in his socks, tall and noiseless, with
a pair of braces beating about his heels. Amongst the shadows of stanchions
and bowsprit, Donkin munched a piece of hard ship's bread, sitting on the
deck with upturned feet and restless eyes; he held the biscuit up before
his mouth in the whole fist, and snapped his jaws at it with a raging face.
Crumbs fell between his outspread legs. Then he got up.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Where's our water-cask?&amp;rsquo; he asked
in a contained voice.

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 16</TT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singleton, without a word, pointed with a big hand that
held a short smouldering pipe. Donkin bent over the cask, drank out of
The tin, splashing the water, turned round and noticed the nigger looking
at him over the shoulder with calm loftiness. He moved up sideways.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;There's a blooming supper for a man,&amp;rsquo;
he whispered bitterly. &amp;lsquo;My dorg at 'ome wouldn't 'ave it. It's
fit enouf for you an' me. 'Ere's a big ship's fo'c'sle.... Not a bloomin'
scrap of meat in the kids I've looked in all the lockers.....

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nigger stared like a man addressed unexpectedly in
a foreign language. Donkin changed his tone: -- &amp;lsquo;Giv'us a bit
of 'baccy, mate&amp;rsquo; he breathed out confidentially, &amp;lsquo;I
'aven't 'ad a smoke or chew for the last month. I am rampin' mad for it.
Come on, old man'!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Don't be familiar,&amp;rsquo; said the nigger.
Donkin started and sat down on a chest near by, out of sheer surprise.
&amp;lsquo;We haven't kept pigs together.&amp;rsquo; continued James Wait
in a deep undertone. &amp;lsquo;Here's your tobacco.&amp;rsquo; Then, after
a pause, he asked: -- &amp;lsquo;What ship?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;<I>Golden
State,</I>&amp;rsquo;muttered Donkin indistinctly, biting the tobacco.
The nigger whistled low. -- &amp;lsquo;Ran?&amp;rsquo; he said curtly.
Donkin nodded: one of his cheeks bulged out. -- &amp;lsquo;In course I
ran,&amp;rsquo; he mumbled. &amp;lsquo;They booted the life hout of one
Dago chap on the passage 'ere, then started on me. I cleared hout 'ere.&amp;rsquo;
-- &amp;lsquo;Left your dunnage behind?&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Yes, dunnage
and money,&amp;rsquo; answered Donkin, raising his voice a little; &amp;lsquo;I
got nothink. No clothes, no bed. A bandy-legged little Hirish chap 'ere
'as give me a blanket..... Think I'll go an' sleep in the fore topmast
staysail to-night.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went on deck trailing behind his back a corner of the
blanket. Singleton, without a glance, moved slightly aside to let him pass.
The nigger put away his shore togs and sat in clean working clothes on
his box, one arm stretched over his knees. After staring at Singleton for
some time he asked without emphasis: -- &amp;lsquo;What kind of ship is
this? Pretty fair? Eh?&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singleton didn't stir. A long while after he said, with
unmoved face: -- &amp;lsquo;Ship!....Ships are all right. It is the men
in them!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went on smoking in the profound silence. The wisdom
of half a century spent listening to the thunder of the waves had spoken
unconsciously through his old lips. The cat purred on the windlass. Then
James Wait had a fit of roaring, rattling cough, that shook

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 17</TT>

<P>him, tossed him like a hurricane, and flung him panting with staring
eyes headlong on his sea-chest. Several men woke up. One said sleepily
out of his bunk: &amp;lsquo;Struth! what a blamed row!&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;I
have a cold on my chest,&amp;rsquo; gasped Wait. -- &amp;lsquo;Cold! you
call it,&amp;rsquo; grumbled the man; &amp;lsquo;should think 'twas something
more.....&amp;rsquo; -- &amp;lsquo;Oh! you think so,&amp;rsquo; said the
nigger upright and loftily scornful again. He climbed into his berth and
began coughing persistently while he put his head out to glare all round
the forecastle. There was no further protest. He fell back on the pillow,
and could be heard there wheezing regularly like a man oppressed in his
sleep.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singleton stood at the door with his face to the light
and his back to the darkness. And alone in the dim emptiness of the sleeping
forecastle he appeared bigger, colossal, very old; old as Father Time himself,
who should have come there into this place as quiet as a sepulchre to contemplate
with patient eyes the short victory of sleep, the consoler. Yet he was
only a child of time, a lonely relic of a devoured and forgotten generation.
He stood, still strong, as ever unthinking; a ready man with a vast empty
past and with no future, with his childlike impulses and his man's passions
already dead within his tattooed breast. The men who could understand his
silence were gone -- those men who knew how to exist beyond the pale of
life and within sight of eternity. They had been strong, as those are strong
who know neither doubts nor hopes. They had been impatient and enduring,
turbulent and devoted, unruly and faithful. Well-meaning people had tried
to represent those men as whining over every mouthful of their food; as
going about their work in fear of their lives. But in truth they had been
men who knew toil, privation, violence, debauchery -- but knew not fear,
and had no desire of spite in their hearts. Men hard to manage, but easy
to inspire; voiceless men -- but men enough to scorn in their hearts the
sentimental voices that bewailed the hardness of their fate. It was a fate
unique and their own; the capacity to bear it appeared to them the privilege
of the chosen! Their generation lived inarticulate and indispensable, without
knowing the sweetness of affections or the refuge of a home -- and died
free from the dark menace of a narrow grave. They were the everlasting
children of the mysterious sea. Their successors are the grown-up children
of a discontented earth. They

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 18</TT>

<P>are less naughty, but less innocent; less profane, but perhaps also
less believing; and if they had learned how to speak they have also learned
how to whine. But the others were strong and mute, they were effaced, bowed
and enduring, like stone caryatides that hold up in the night the lighted
halls of a resplendent and glorious edifice. They are gone now -- and it
does not matter. The sea and the earth are unfaithful to their children:
a truth, a faith, a generation of men goes -- and is forgotten, and it
does not matter! Except, perhaps, to the few of those who believed the
truth confessed the faith -- or loved the men.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A breeze was coming. The ship that had been lying tide-rode
swung to a heavier puff; and suddenly the slack of the chain cable between
the windlass and the hawse-pipe clinked, slipped forward an inch, and rose
gently off the deck with a startling suggestion as of unsuspected life
that had been lurking stealthily in the iron. In the hawse-pipe The grinding
links sent through the ship a sound like a low groan of a man sighing under
a burden. The strain came on the windlass, the chain tautened like a string,
vibrated -- and the handle of the screw-brake moved in slight jerks. Singleton
stepped forward.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Till then he had been standing meditative and unthinking,
reposeful and hopeless, with a face grim and blank -- a sixty-year-old
child of the mysterious sea. The thoughts of all his lifetime could have
been expressed in six words, but the stir of those things that were as
much a part of his existence as his beating heart called up a gleam of
alert understanding upon the sternness of his aged face. The flame of the
lamp swayed, and the old man, with knitted and bushy eyebrows, stood over
the brake, watchful and motionless in the wild saraband of dancing shadows.
Then the ship, obedient to the call of her anchor, forged ahead slightly
and eased the strain. The cable relieved, hung down, and after swaying
imperceptibly to and fro dropped with a loud tap on the hard wood planks.
Singleton seized the high lever, and, by a violent throw forward of his
body, wrung out another half-turn from the brake. He recovered himself,
breathed largely, and remained for awhile glaring down at the powerful
and compact engine that squatted on the deck at his feet, like some quiet
monster -- a creature amazing and tame.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;You....hold!&amp;rsquo; he growled at it masterfully,
in the incult tangle of his white beard.
