<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next morning, at daylight, the <I>Narcissus</I> went to
sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A slight haze blurred the horizon. Outside the harbour
the measureless expanse of smooth water lay sparkling lay sparkling like
a floor of jewels, and as empty as the sky. The short black tug gave a
pluck to windward, in the usual way, then let go the rope, and hovered
for a moment on the quarter with her engines stopped; while the slim, long
hull of the ship moved ahead slowly under lower top-sails. The loose upper
canvas blew out in the breeze with soft round contours, resembling small
white clouds snared in the maze of ropes. Then the sheets were hauled home,
the yards hoisted, and the ship became a high and lonely pyramid, gliding,
all shining and white, through the sunlit mist. The tug turned short round
and went away towards land. Twenty-six pairs of eyes watched her low broad
stern crawling languidly over the beating water with fierce hurry. She
resembled an enormous and aquatic blackbeetle, surprised by the light,
overwhelmed by the sunshine, trying to escape with ineffectual effort into
the distant gloom of the land. She left a lingering smudge of smoke on
the sky, and two vanishing trails of foam on the water. On the place where
she had stopped a round black patch of soot remained undulating on the
swell -- an unclean mark of the creature's rest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>Narcissus</I> left alone, heading south, seemed
to stand resplendent and still upon the restless sea, under the moving
sun. Flakes of foam swept past her sides; the water struck her with flashing
blows; the land glided away, slowly fading; a few birds screamed on motionless
wings over the swaying mastheads. But soon the land disappeared, the birds
went away; and to the west the pointed sail of an Arab dhow running for
Bombay, rose triangular and upright above the sharp edge of the horizon,
lingered, and vanished like an illusion. Then the ship's wake, long and
straight, stretched itself out through a day of immense solitude. The setting
sun, burning on the level of the water, flamed crimson below the blackness
of heavy rain clouds. The sunset squall, coming up from behind, dissolved
itself into the short deluge of a hissing shower. It left the ship glistening
from trucks to waterline, and with darkened sails. She ran easily before
a fair monsoon, with her decks cleared for the night; and, moving along
with her, was heard the sustained and monotonous swishing of the waves,
mingled with the low whispers of men mustered aft for the setting of watches;
the short plaint of some block aloft; or, now and then, a loud sigh of
wind.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Baker, coming out of his cabin, called out the first
name sharply before closing the door behind him. He was going to take charge
of the deck. On the homeward trip according to an old custom of the sea,
the chief officer takes the first night-watch -- from eight till midnight.
So Mr. Baker, after he had heard the last &amp;lsquo;Yes, sir!&amp;rsquo;
said moodily, &amp;lsquo;Relieve the wheel and look-out;&amp;rsquo; and
climbed with heavy feet the poop ladder to windward. Soon after Mr. Creighton
came down, whistling softly, and went into the cabin. On the doorstep the
steward lounged, in slippers, meditative, and with his shirt-sleeves rolled
up to the armpits. On the main deck the cook, locking up the galley doors,
had an altercation with young Charley about a pair of socks. He could be
heard saying impressively, in the darkness amidships: &amp;lsquo;You don't
deserve a kindness. I've been drying them for you, and now you complain
about the holes -- and you swear, too! Right in front of me! If I hadn't
been a Christian -- which you ain't, you young ruffian -- I would give
you a clout on the head.....Go away!&amp;rsquo; Men in couples or threes
stood pensive or moved silently along the bulwarks in the

<P>waist. The first busy day of a homeward passage was sinking into the
dull peace of resumed routine. Aft, on the high poop, Mr. Baker walked
shuffling, grunted to himself in the pauses of his thoughts. Forward, the
look-out man, erect between the flukes of the two anchors, hummed an endless
tune, keeping his eyes fixed dutifully ahead in a vacant stare. A multitude
of stars coming out into the clear night peopled the emptiness of the sky.
They glittered, as if alive above the sea; they surrounded the running
ship on all sides; more intense than the eyes of a staring crowd, and as
inscrutable as the souls of men.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The passage had begun; and the ship, a fragment detached
from the earth, went on lonely and swift like a small planet. Round her
the abysses of sky and sea met in an unattainable frontier. A great circular
solitude moved with her, ever changing and ever the same, always monotonous
and always imposing. Now and then another wandering white speck, burdened
with life, appeared far off -- disappeared; intent on its own destiny.
The sun looked upon her all day, and every morning rose with a burning,
round stare of undying curiosity. She had her own future; she was alive
with the lives of those beings who trod her decks; like that earth which
had given her up to the sea, she had an intolerable load of regrets and
hopes. On her lived timid truth and audacious lies; and, like the earth,
she was unconscious, fair to see -- and condemned by men to an ignoble
fate. The august loneliness of her path lent dignity to the sordid inspiration
of her pilgrimage. She drove foaming to the southward, as if guided by
the courage of a high endeavour. The smiling greatness of the sea dwarfed
the extent of time. The days raced after one another, brilliant and quick
like the flashes of a lighthouse, and the nights, eventful and short, resembled
fleeting dreams. The men had shaken into their places, and the half-hourly
voice of the bells ruled their life of unceasing care. Night and day the
head and shoulders of a seaman could be seen aft by the wheel, outlined
high against sunshine or starlight, very steady above the stir of revolving
spokes. The faces changed, passing in rotation. Youthful faces, bearded
faces, dark faces: faces serene, or faces moody, but all akin with the
brotherhood of the sea; all with the same attentive expression of eyes,
carefully watching the compass

<P>or the sails. Captain Allistoun, serious, and with an old red muffler
round his throat all day long pervaded the poop. At night, many times he
rose out of the darkness of the companion, such as a phantom above a grave,
and stood watchful and mute under the stars, his night-shirt fluttering
like a flag -- then, without a sound, sank down again. He was born on the
shores of the Pentland Firth. In his youth he attained the rank of harpooner
in Peterhead whalers. When he spoke of that time his restless grey eyes
became still and cold, like the loom of ice. Afterwards he went into the
East Indian trade for the sake of change. He had commanded the <I>Narcissus</I>
since she was built. He loved his ship, and drove her unmercifully; for
his secret ambition was to make her accomplish some day a brilliantly quick
passage which would be mentioned in nautical papers. He pronounced his
owner's name with a sardonic smile spoke but seldom to his officers, and
reproved errors in a gentle voice, with words that cut to the quick. His
hair was iron-grey, his face hard and of the colour of pump-leather. He
shaved every morning of his life -- at six -- but once (being caught in
a fierce hurricane eighty miles south-west of Mauritius) he had missed
three consecutive days. He feared naught but an unforgiving God, and wished
to end his days in a little house, with a plot of ground attached -- far
in the country -- out of sight of the sea.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He, the ruler of that minute world, seldom descended from
the Olympian heights of his poop. Below him -- at his feet, so to speak
-- common mortals led their busy and insignificant lives. Along the main
deck Mr. Baker grunted in a manner bloodthirsty and innocuous; and kept
all our noses to the grindstone, being -- as he once remarked -- paid for
doing that very thing. The men working about the deck were healthy and
contented -- as most seamen are, when once well out to sea. The true peace
of God begins at any spot a thousand miles from the nearest land; and when
He sends there the messengers of His might it is not in terrible wrath
against crime, presumption, and folly, but paternally, to chasten simple
hearts -- ignorant hearts that know nothing of life, and beat undisturbed
by envy or greed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening the cleared decks had a reposeful aspect,
resembling the autumn of the earth. The sun was sinking to rest, wrapped

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 23</TT>

<P>in a mantle of warm clouds. Forward, on the end of the spare spurs,
the boatswain and the carpenter sat together with crossed arms; two men
friendly, powerful, and deep-chested. Beside them the short, dumpy sailmaker
-- who had been in the Navy -- related, between the whiffs of his pipe,
impossible stories about Admirals. Couples tramped backwards and forwards,
keeping step and balance without effort, in a confined space. Pigs grunted
in the big pigstye. Belfast, leaning thoughtfully on his elbow, above the
bars communed with them through the silence of his meditation. Fellows
with shirts open wide on sunburnt breasts sat upon the mooring bits, and
all up the steps of the forecastle ladders. By the foremast a few discussed
in a circle the characteristics of a gentleman. One said: -- &amp;lsquo;It's
money as does it.&amp;rsquo; Another maintained: -- &amp;lsquo;No, it's
the way they speak.&amp;rsquo; Lame Knowles stumped up with an unwashed
face (he had the distinction of being the dirty man of the forecastle),
and, showing a few yellow fangs in a shrewd smile, explained craftily that
he &amp;lsquo;had seen some of their pants&amp;rsquo; The backsides of
them -- he had observed -- were thinner than paper from constant sitting
down in offices, yet otherwise they looked first-rate and would last for
years. It was all appearance. &amp;lsquo;It was,&amp;rsquo; he said, &amp;lsquo;bloomin'
easy to be a gentleman when you had a clean job for life.&amp;rsquo; They
disputed endlessly, obstinate and childish; they repeated in shouts and
with inflamed faces their amazing arguments; while the soft breeze, eddying
down the enormous cavity of the foresail, that stood out distended above
their bare heads, stirred the tumbled hair with a touch passing and light
like an indulgent caress.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They were forgetting their toil, they were forgetting themselves.
The cook approached to hear, and stood by, beaming with the inward consciousness
of his faith, like a conceited saint unable to forget his glorious reward;
Donkin, solitary and brooding over his wrongs on the forecastle-head, moved
closer to catch the drift of the discussion below him; he turned his sallow
face to the sea, and his thin nostrils moved, sniffing the breeze, as he
lounged negligently by the rail. In the glow of sunset faces shone with
interest, teeth flashed, eyes sparkled. The walking couples stood still
suddenly, with broad grins; a man bending over a washtub, sat up, entranced,
with the soapsuds flecking his wet arms. Even the

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 24</TT>

<P>three petty officers listened leaning back, comfortably propped, and
with superior smiles. Belfast left off scratching the ear of his favorite
pig, and, open-mouthed, tried with eager eyes to have his say. He lifted
his arms, grimacing and baffled. From a distance Charley screamed at the
ring: -- &amp;lsquo;I know about gentlemen morn'n any of you. I've been
hintymate with 'em....I've blacked their boots.&amp;rsquo; The cook, craning
his neck to hear better, was scandalized. &amp;lsquo;Keep your mouth shut
when your elders speak, you impudent young heathen -- you.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;All
right, old Hallelujah, I'm done,&amp;rsquo; answered Charley, soothingly.
At some opinion of dirty Knowles, delivered with an air of supernatural
cunning, a ripple of laughter ran along, rose like a wave, burst with a
startling roar. They stamped with both feet; they turned their shouting
faces to the sky; many, spluttering, slapped their thighs; while one or
two, bent double, gasped hugging themselves with both arms like men in
pain. The carpenter and the boatswain, without changing their attitude,
shook with laughter where they sat; the sailmaker, charged with an anecdote
about a Commodore, looked sulky; the cook was wiping his eyes with a greasy
rag; and lame Knowles, astonished at his own success, stood in their midst
showing a slow smile.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly the face of Donkin leaning high-shouldered over
the after-rail became grave. Something like a weak rattle was heard through
the forecastle door. It became a murmur; it ended in a sighing groan. The
washerman plunged both his arms into the tub abruptly; the cook became
more crestfallen than an exposed backslider; the boatswain moved his shoulders
uneasily; the carpenter got up with a spring and walked away -- while the
sailmaker seemed mentally to give his story up, and began to puff at his
pipe with sombre determination. In the blackness of the doorway a pair
of eyes glimmered white, and big and staring. Then James Wait's head protruding,
became visible, as if suspended between the two hands that grasped a doorpost
on each side of the face. The tassel of his blue woollen nightcap, cocked
forward, danced gaily over his left eyelid. He stepped out in a tottering
stride. He looked powerful as ever, but showed a strange and affected unsteadiness
in his gait; his face was perhaps a trifle thinner, and his eyes appeared
rather startlingly prominent. He seemed to hasten the

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 25</TT>

<P>retreat of departing light by his very presence; the setting sun dipped
sharply, as though fleeing from our nigger; a black mist emanated from
him; a subtle and dismal influence a something cold and gloomy that floated
out and settled on all the faces like a mourning veil. The circle broke
up. The joy of laughter died on stiffened lips. There was not a smile left
among all the ship's company. Not a word was spoken. Many turned their
backs, trying to look unconcerned; others, with averted heads, sent half-reluctant
glances out of the corners of their eyes. They resembled criminals conscious
of misdeeds more than honest men distracted by doubt; only two or three
stared frankly, but stupidly, with lips slightly open. All expected James
Wait to say something, and, at the same time, had the air of knowing beforehand
what he would say. He leaned his back against the doorpost, and with heavy
eyes swept over us a glance domineering and pained, like a sick tyrant
overawing a crowd of abject but untrustworthy slaves.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No one went away. they waited in fascinated dread. He said
ironically, with gasps between the words: --

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Thank you....chaps. You....are nice....and....
quiet....you are! Yelling so....before....the door....&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made a longer pause, during which he worked his ribs
in an exaggerated labour of breathing. It was intolerable. Feet were shuffled.
Belfast let out a groan; but Donkin above blinked his red eyelids with
invisible eyelashes, and smiled bitterly over the nigger's head.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nigger went on again with surprising ease. He gasped
no more, and his voice rang, hollow and loud, as though he had been talking
in an empty cavern. He was contemptuously angry.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lsquo;I tried to get a wink of sleep. You know I can't
sleep o'nights. And you come jabbering near the door here like a blooming
lot of old women....You think yourselves good shipmates. Do you?.... Much
you care for a dying man!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Belfast swung away from the pigstye. &amp;lsquo;Jimmy,&amp;rsquo;
he cried tremulously, &amp;lsquo;if you hadn't been sick I would -- &amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped. The nigger waited awhile, then said, in a gloomy
tone: -- &amp;lsquo;You would.....What? Go an' fight another such one as
yourself. Leave me alone. It won't be for long. I'll soon die.....It's
coming right enough!&amp;rsquo;

<P>

<P><TT>Page 26</TT>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Men stood around very still, breathing lightly, and with
exasperated eyes It was just what they had expected, and hated to hear,
that idea of stalking death, thrust at them many times a day like a boast
and like a menace by this obnoxious nigger. He seemed to take a pride in
that death which, so far, had attended only upon the ease of his life;
he was overbearing about it, as if no one else in the world had ever been
intimate with such a companion; he paraded it unceasingly before us with
an affectionate persistence that made its presence indubitable, and at
the same time incredible. No man should be suspected of such monstrous
friendship! Was he a reality -- or was he a sham -- this ever-expected
visitor of Jimmy's? We hesitated between pity and mistrust, while, on the
slightest provocation, he shook before our eyes the bones of his bothersome
and infamous skeleton. He was for ever trotting him out. He would talk
of that coming death as though it had been already there, as if it had
been walking the deck outside, as if it would presently come in to sleep
in the only empty bunk; as if it had sat by his side at every meal. It
interfered daily with our occupations, with our leisure, with our amusements.
We had no songs and no music in the evening, because Jimmy (we all lovingly
called him Jimmy, to conceal our hate of his accomplice) had managed, with
that prospective decease of his, to disturb even Archie's mental balance.
Archie was the owner of the concertina; but after a couple of stinging
lectures from Jimmy he refused to play any more. He said: -- &amp;lsquo;Yon's
an uncanny joker. I dinna ken what's wrang wi' him, but there's something
verra wrang, verra wrang. It's nae manner of use asking me. I won't play.&amp;rsquo;
Our singers became mute because Jimmy was a dying man. For the same reason
no chap -- as Knowles remarked -- could &amp;lsquo;drive in a nail to hang
his few poor rags upon,&amp;rsquo; without being made aware of the enormity
he committed in disturbing Jimmy's interminable last moments. At night,
instead of the cheerful yell, &amp;lsquo;One bell! Turn out! Do you hear
there? Hey! hey! hey! Show leg!&amp;rsquo; the watches were called man
by man, in whispers, so as not to interfere with Jimmy's, possibly, last
slumber on earth. True, he was always awake, and managed, as we sneaked
out on deck, to plant in our backs some cutting remark that, for the moment,
made us feel as if we had been brutes, and afterwards made us suspect ourselves
of

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 27</TT>

<P>being fools. We spoke in low tones within that fo'c'sle as though it
had been a church. We ate our meals in silence and dread, for Jimmy was
capricious with his food, and railed bitterly at the salt meat, at the
biscuits, at the tea as at articles unfit for human consumption -- &amp;lsquo;let
alone for a dying man!&amp;rsquo; He would say: -- &amp;lsquo;Can't you
find a better slice of meat for a sick man who's trying to get home to
be cured -- or buried? But there! if I had a chance, you fellows would
do away with it. You would poison me. Look at what you have given me! &amp;rsquo;
We served him in his bed with rage and humility, as if we had been the
base couriers of a hated prince; and he rewarded us by his unconciliating
criticism. He had found the secret of keeping for ever on the run the fundamental
imbecility of mankind; he had the secret of life, that confounded dying
men, and he made himself master of every moment of our existence. We grew
desperate, and remained submissive. Emotional little Belfast was for ever
on the verge of assault or on the verge of tears. One evening he confided
to Archie: -- &amp;lsquo;for a ha'penny I would knock his ugly block off
the skulking dodger!&amp;rsquo; And the straight-forward Archie pretended
to be shocked! Such was the infernal spell which that casual St. Kitt's
nigger had cast upon our guileless manhood! But the same night Belfast
stole from the galley the officers' Sunday fruit pie, to tempt the fastidious
appetite of Jimmy. He endangered not only his long friendship with the
cook but also -- as is appeared -- his eternal welfare. The cook was over-whelmed
with grief; he did not know the culprit but he knew that wickedness flourished;
he knew that Satan was abroad amongst those men, whom he looked upon as
in some way under his spiritual care. Whenever he saw three or four of
us standing together he would leave his stove, to run out and preach. We
fled from him; and only Charley (who knew the thief) affronted the cook
with a candid gaze which irritated the good man. &amp;lsquo;It's you, I
believe,&amp;rsquo; he groaned, sorrowful, and with a patch of soot on
his chin. &amp;lsquo;It's you. You are a brand for burning! No more of
your socks in my galley.&amp;rsquo; Soon, unofficially, the information
was spread about that, should there be another case of stealing, our marmalade
(an extra allowance: half a pound per man) would be stopped. Mr. Baker
ceased to heap jocular abuse upon his favourites, and grunted suspiciously
at all. The captain's cold eyes, high up on the poop,

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 28</TT>

<P>glittered mistrustful, as he surveyed us trooping in a small mob from
halyards to braces for the usual evening pull at all the ropes. Such stealing
in a merchant ship is difficult to check, and may be taken as a declaration
by the men of their dislike for their officers. It is a bad symptom. It
may end in God knows what trouble. The <I>Narcissus</I> was still a peaceful
ship, but mutual confidence was shaken. Donkin did not conceal his delight.
We were dismayed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then illogical Belfast approached our nigger with great
fury. James Wait, with his elbow on the pillow, choked, gasped out: --
&amp;lsquo;Did I ask you to bone the dratted thing? Blow your blamed pie.
It has made me worse -- you little Irish lunatic, you!&amp;rsquo; Belfast,
with scarlet face and trembling lips, made a dash at him. Every man in
the forecastle rose with a shout. There was a moment of wild tumult. Some
one shrieked piercingly: -- &amp;lsquo;Easy, Belfast! Easy!....&amp;rsquo;
We expected Belfast to strangle Wait without more ado. Dust flew. We heard
it through the nigger's cough, metallic and explosive like a gong. Next
moment we saw Belfast hanging over him. He was saying plaintively: -- &amp;lsquo;Don't!
Don't, Jimmy! don't be like that. an angel couldn't put up with ye -- sick
as ye are.&amp;rsquo; He looked round at us from Jimmy 's bedside, his
comical mouth twitching, and through tearful eyes; then he tried to put
straight the disarranged blankets. The unceasing whisper of the sea filled
the forecastle. Was James Wait frightened, or touched, or repentant? He
lay on his back with a hand to his side, and as motionless as if his expected
visitor had come at last. Belfast fumbled about his feet, repeating with
emotion: -- &amp;lsquo;Yes. We know. Ye are bad, but....Just say what ye
want done, and....We all know ye are bad -- very bad.... &amp;rsquo;No!
Decidedly James Wait was not touched or repentant. Truth to say, he seemed
rather startled. He sat up with incredible suddenness and ease. &amp;lsquo;Ah,
you think I am bad, do you?&amp;rsquo; he said gloomily, in his clearest
baritone voice (to hear him speak sometimes you would never think t here
was anything wrong with that man). &amp;lsquo;Do you?.... Well, act according!
Some of you haven't sense enough to put a blanket shipshape over a sick
man. There! Leave it alone'! I can die anyhow!&amp;rsquo; Belfast turned
away limply with a gesture of discouragement. In the silence of the forecastle,
full of interested men, Donkin pronounced distinctly: -- &amp;lsquo;Well,
I'm blowed!&amp;rsquo; and sniggered. Wait looked at him. He looked at
him in a

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 29</TT>

<P>quite friendly manner. Nobody could tell what would please our incomprehensible
invalid: but for us the scorn of that snigger was hard to bear.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Donkin's position in the forecastle was distinguished but
unsafe. He stood on the bad eminence of a general dislike. He was left
alone; and in his isolation he could do nothing but think of the gales
of the Cape of Good Hope and envy us the possession of warm clothing and
waterproofs. Our sea-boots, our oilskin coats, our well-filled sea-chests,
were to him so many causes for bitter meditation: he had none of those
things, and he felt instinctively that no man, when the need arose, would
offer to share them with him. He was impudently cringing to us and systematically
insolent to the officers. He anticipated the best results, for himself,
from such a line of conduct -- and was mistaken. Such natures forget that
under extreme provocation men will be just -- whether they want to be so
or not. Donkin's insolence to long-suffering Mr. Baker became at last intolerable
to us, and we rejoiced when the mate, one dark nigh, tamed him for good.
I was done neatly, with great decency and decorum, and with little noise.
We had been called -- just before midnight -- to trim the yards, and Donkin
-- as usual made -- as usual, made insulting remarks. We stood sleepily
in a row with the forebrace in our hands waiting for the next order, and
heard in the darkness a scuffly trampling of feet, an exclamation of surprise,
sounds of cuffs and slaps, suppressed, hissing whispers: -- &amp;lsquo;Ah!
Will you!&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Don't!.... Don't!&amp;rsquo;....&amp;lsquo;Then
behave.&amp;rsquo;...&amp;lsquo;Oh! Oh!....&amp;rsquo; Afterwards there
were soft thuds mixed with the rattle of iron things as if a man's body
had been tumbling helplessly amongst the main-pump rods. Before we could
realise the situation, Mr. Baker's voice was heard very near and a little
impatient: -- &amp;lsquo;Haul away, men! Lay back on that rope!&amp;rsquo;
And we did lay back on the rope with great alacrity. As if nothing had
happened, the chief mate went on trimming the yards with his usual and
exasperating fastidiousness. We didn't at the time see anything of Donkin,
and did not care. Had the chief officer thrown him overboard, no man would
have said as much as &amp;lsquo;Hallo! he's gone!&amp;rsquo; But, in truth,
no great harm was done -- even if Donkin did lose one of his front teeth.
We perceived this in the morning, and preserved a ceremonious silence:
the etiquette of the forecastle

<P>
<HR>

<P><TT>Page 30</TT>

<P>commanded us to be blind and dumb in such a case, and we cherished the
decencies of our life more than ordinary landsmen respect theirs. Charley,
with unpardonable want of <I>savoir vivre</I>, yelled out: -- &amp;lsquo;'Ave
you been to your dentyst?.... Hurt ye, didn't it?&amp;rsquo; He got a box
on the ear from one of his best friends. The boy was surprised, and remained
plunged in grief for at least three hours. We were sorry for him, but youth
requires even more discipline than age. Donkin grinned venomously. From
that day he became pitiless; told Jimmy that he was a &amp;lsquo;black
fraud&amp;rsquo; ; hinted to us that we were an imbecile lot, daily taken
in by a vulgar nigger. And Jimmy seemed to like the fellow!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singleton lived untouched by human emotions. Taciturn and
unsmiling, he breathed amongst us -- in that alone resembling the rest
of the crowd. We were trying to be decent chaps, and found it jolly difficult;
we oscillated between the desire of virtue and the fear of ridicule; we
wished to save ourselves from the pain of remorse, but did not want to
be made the contemptible dupes of our sentiment. Jimmy's hateful accomplice
seemed to have blown with his impure breath undreamt-of subtleties into
our hearts. We were disturbed and cowardly. That we knew. Singleton seemed
to know nothing, understand nothing. We had thought him till then as wise
as he looked, but now we dared, at times, suspect him of being stupid --
from old age. One day, however, at dinner, as we sat on our boxes round
a tin dish that stood on the deck within the circle of our feet, Jimmy
expressed his general disgust with men and things in words that were particularly
disgusting. Singleton lifted his head. We became mute. The old man, addressing
Jimmy, asked: -- &amp;lsquo;Are you dying?&amp;rsquo; Thus interrogated,
Jame Wait appeared horribly startled and confused. We were all startled.
Mouths remained open; hearts thumped; eyes blinked; a dropped tin fork
rattled in the dish; a man rose as if to go out, and stood still. In less
than a minute Jimmy pulled himself together. -- &amp;lsquo;Why? Can't you
see I am?&amp;rsquo; he answered shakily. Singleton lifted a piece of soaked
biscuit (&amp;lsquo;his teeth&amp;rsquo; -- he declared -- &amp;lsquo;had
no edge on them now&amp;rsquo;) to his lips. -- &amp;lsquo;Well, get on
with your dying,&amp;rsquo; he said with venerable mildness: &amp;lsquo;don't
raise a blamed fuss with us over that job. We can't help you.&amp;rsquo;
Jimmy fell back in his bunk, and for a long time lay very still wiping
the perspiration off his chin. The dinner-tins were put

<P>away quickly. On deck we discussed the incident in whispers. Some showed
a chuckling exultation. Many looked grave. Wamibo, after long periods of
staring dreaminess, attempted abortive smiles; and one of the young Scandinavians,
much tormented by doubt, ventured in the second dog-watch to approach Singleton
(the old man did not encourage us much to speak to him) and ask sheepishly:
-- &amp;lsquo;You think he will die?&amp;rsquo; Singleton looked up. --
&amp;lsquo;Why, of course he will die.&amp;rsquo;he said deliberately.
This seemed decisive. It was promptly imparted to every one by him who
had consulted the oracle. Shy and eager, he would step up and with averted
gaze recite his formula: -- &amp;lsquo;Old Singleton says he will die.&amp;rsquo;
It was a relief! At last we knew that our compassion would not be misplaced,
and we could again smile without misgivings -- but we reckoned without
Donkin. Donkin &amp;lsquo;didn't want to 'ave no truck with 'em dirty furriners.&amp;rsquo;
When Neillssen came to him with the news: &amp;lsquo;Singleton says he
will die,&amp;rsquo; he answered him by a spiteful &amp;lsquo;And so will
you -- you fat-headed Dutchman. Wish you Dutchmen were hall dead -- 'stead
comin' takin' our money hinto your starvin' country.&amp;rsquo; We were
appalled. We perceived that after all Singleton's answer meant nothing.
We began to hate him for making fun of us. All our certitudes were going;
we were on doubtful terms with our officers; the cook had given us up for
lost; we had overheard the boatswain's opinion that &amp;lsquo;we were
a crowd of softies&amp;rsquo; We suspected Jimmy, one another, and even
our very selves. We did not know what to do. At every insignificant turn
of our humble life we met Jimmy overbearing and blocking the way, arm-in-arm
with his awful and veiled familiar. It was a weird servitude.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It began a week after leaving Bombay and came on us stealthily
like any other great misfortune. Every one had remarked that Jimmy from
the first was very slack at his work; but we thought it simply the outcome
of his philosophy of life. Donkin said: -- &amp;lsquo;You put no more weight
on a rope than a bloody spurrer.&amp;rsquo; He disdained him. Belfast,
ready for a fight, exclaimed provokingly: -- &amp;lsquo;You don't kill
yourself, old man!&amp;rsquo; -- -- &amp;lsquo;Would you?&amp;rsquo; he
retorted with extreme scorn -- and Belfast retired. One morning, as we
were washing decks, Mr. Baker called to him: -- &amp;lsquo;Bring your broom
over here, Wait.&amp;rsquo; He strolled languidly. &amp;lsquo;Move yourself!
Ough!&amp;rsquo; grunted Mr. Baker. &amp;lsquo;What's the matter with y
our hind legs?&amp;rsquo; He stopped dead

<P>short. He gazed slowly with eyes that bulged out, with an expression
audacious and sad. -- &amp;lsquo;It isn't my legs,&amp;rsquo; he said,
&amp;lsquo;it's my lungs.&amp;rsquo; Everybody listened. -- &amp;lsquo;What's....Ough....!&amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;What's wrong with them?&amp;rsquo; inquired Mr. Baker. All the
watch stood around on the wet deck, grinning, with brooms or buckets in
their hands. He said mournfully: -- &amp;lsquo;Going -- or gone. Can't
you see I'm a dying man? I know it!&amp;rsquo; Mr. Baker was disgusted.
-- &amp;lsquo;Then why the devil did you ship aboard here? -- &amp;rsquo;
&amp;lsquo;I must live till I die -- mustn't I?&amp;rsquo; he replied.
The grins became audible. -- &amp;lsquo;Go off the deck -- get out of my
sight,&amp;rsquo; said Mr. Baker. He was nonplussed. It was an unique experience.
James Wait, obedient, dropped his broom, and walked slowly forward. A burst
of laughter followed him. It was too funny. All hands laughed.....They
laughed!....Alas!&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He became the tormentor of all our moments; he was worse
than a nightmare. You couldn't see that there was anything wrong with him:
a nigger does not show. He was not very fat -- certainly -- but then he
was no leaner than other niggers we had known. He coughed often, but the
most prejudiced person could perceive that, mostly, he coughed when it
suited his purpose. he wouldn't, or couldn't, do his work -- and he wouldn't
lie up. One day he would skip aloft with the best of them, and next time
we would be obliged to risk our lives to get his limp body down. He was
reported, he was examined; he was remonstrated with, threatened, cajoled,
lectured. He was called into the cabin to interview the captain. There
were wild rumours. It was said he had cheeked the old man; it was said
he had frightened him. Charley maintained that the &amp;lsquo;skipper,
weepin' 'as giv' 'im 'is blessin' an' a pot of jam.&amp;rsquo; Knowles
had it from the steward that the unspeakable Jimmy had been reeling against
the cabin furniture; that he had groaned; that he had complained of general
brutality and disbelief; and had ended by coughing all over the old man's
meteorological journals which were then spread on the table. At any rate,
Wait returned forward supported by the steward. who, in a pained and shocked
voice, entreated us: -- &amp;lsquo;Here! Catch hold of him, one or you.
He is to lie up.&amp;rsquo; Jimmy drank a tin mugful of coffee, and, after
bullying first one and then another, went to bed. He remained there most
of the time, but when it suited him would come on deck and appear amongst
us. He was scornful and brooding; he looked ahead upon

<P>the sea; and no one could tell what was the meaning of that black man
sitting apart in a meditative attitude and as motionless as a carving.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He refused steadily all medicine; he threw sago and cornflour
overboard till the steward got tired of bringing it to him. He asked for
paregoric. They sent him a big bottle; enough to poison a wilderness of
babes. He kept it between his mattress and the deal lining of the ship's
side; and nobody ever saw him take a dose. Donkin abused him to his face,
jeered at him while he gasped; and the same day Wait would lend him a warm
jersey. Once Donkin reviled him for half an hour; reproached him with the
extra work his malingering gave to the watch; and ended by calling him
&amp;lsquo;a black-faced swine.&amp;rsquo; Under the spell of our accursed
perversity we were horror-struck. But Jimmy positively seemed to revel
in that abuse. It made him look cheerful -- and Donkin had a pair of old
sea boots thrown at him. &amp;lsquo;Here, you East-end trash,&amp;rsquo;
boomed Wait, &amp;lsquo;you may have that.&amp;rsquo;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last Mr. Baker had to tell the captain that James Wait
was disturbing the peace of the ship. &amp;lsquo;Knock discipline on the
head -- he will, Ough,&amp;rsquo; grunted Mr. Baker. As a matter of fact,
the starboard watch came as near as possible to refusing duty, when ordered
one morning by the boatswain to wash out their forecastle. It appears Jimmy
objected to a wet floor -- and that morning we were in a compassionate
mood. We thought the boatswain a brute, and, practically, told him so.
Only Mr. Baker's delicate tact prevented an all-fired row: he refused to
take us seriously. He came bustling forward, and called us many unpolite
names, but in such a hearty and seamanlike manner that we began to feel
ashamed of ourselves. In truth, we thought him much too good a sailor to
annoy him willingly: and after all Jimmy might have been a fraud -- probably
was! The forecastle got a clean up that morning; but in the afternoon a
sick-bay was fitted up in the deck-house. It was a nice little cabin opening
on deck, and with two berths. Jimmy's belongings were transported there,
and then -- notwithstanding his protests -- Jimmy himself. He said he couldn't
walk. Four men carried him on a blanket. He complained that he would have
to die there alone, like a dog. We grieved for him, and were delighted
to have him removed from the forecastle. We attended him as before. The
galley was next door, and the cook looked in many times a day. Wait became
a little more cheerful. Knowles affirmed having heard him laugh to himself
in peals one day. Others had seen him walking about on deck at night. His
little place, with the door ajar on a long hook, was always full of tobacco
smoke. We spoke through the crack cheerfully, sometimes abusively, as we
passed by, intent on our work. He fascinated us. He would never let doubt
die. He overshadowed the ship. Invulnerable in his promise of speedy corruption
he trampled on our self-respect, he demonstrated to us daily our want of
moral courage; he tainted our lives. Had we been a miserable gang of wretched
immortals, unhallowed alike by hope and fear, he could not have lorded
it over us with a more pitiless assertion of his sublime privilege.
