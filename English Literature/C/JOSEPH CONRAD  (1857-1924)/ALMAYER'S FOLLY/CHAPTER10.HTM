<P>"It has set at last," said Nina to her mother pointing towards

<P>the hills behind which the sun had sunk.&nbsp; "Listen, mother, I am

<P>going now to Bulangi's creek, and if I should never return--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She interrupted herself, and something like doubt dimmed for a

<P>moment the fire of suppressed exaltation that had glowed in her

<P>eyes and had illuminated the serene impassiveness of her features

<P>with a ray of eager life during all that long day of excitement--

<P>the day of joy and anxiety, of hope and terror, of vague grief

<P>and indistinct delight.&nbsp; While the sun shone with that dazzling

<P>light in which her love was born and grew till it possessed her

<P>whole being, she was kept firm in her unwavering resolve by the

<P>mysterious whisperings of desire which filled her heart with

<P>impatient longing for the darkness that would mean the end of

<P>danger and strife, the beginning of happiness, the fulfilling of

<P>love, the completeness of life.&nbsp; It had set at last!&nbsp; The
short

<P>tropical twilight went out before she could draw the long breath

<P>of relief; and now the sudden darkness seemed to be full of

<P>menacing voices calling upon her to rush headlong into the

<P>unknown; to be true to her own impulses, to give herself up to

<P>the passion she had evoked and shared.&nbsp; He was waiting!&nbsp; In
the

<P>solitude of the secluded clearing, in the vast silence of the

<P>forest he was waiting alone, a fugitive in fear of his life.

<P>Indifferent to his danger he was waiting for her.&nbsp; It was for her

<P>only that he had come; and now as the time approached when he

<P>should have his reward, she asked herself with dismay what meant

<P>that chilling doubt of her own will and of her own desire?&nbsp; With

<P>an effort she shook off the fear of the passing weakness.&nbsp; He

<P>should have his reward.&nbsp; Her woman's love and her woman's honour

<P>overcame the faltering distrust of that unknown future waiting

<P>for her in the darkness of the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, you will not return," muttered Mrs. Almayer, prophetically.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Without you he will not go, and if he remains here--"&nbsp; She waved

<P>her hand towards the lights of "Almayer's Folly," and the

<P>unfinished sentence died out in a threatening murmur.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two women had met behind the house, and now were walking

<P>slowly together towards the creek where all the canoes were

<P>moored.&nbsp; Arrived at the fringe of bushes they stopped by a common

<P>impulse, and Mrs. Almayer, laying her hand on her daughter's arm,

<P>tried in vain to look close into the girl's averted face.&nbsp; When

<P>she attempted to speak her first words were lost in a stifled sob

<P>that sounded strangely coming from that woman who, of all human

<P>passions, seemed to know only those of anger and hate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are going away to be a great Ranee," she said at last, in a

<P>voice that was steady enough now, "and if you be wise you shall

<P>have much power that will endure many days, and even last into

<P>your old age.&nbsp; What have I been?&nbsp; A slave all my life, and
I have

<P>cooked rice for a man who had no courage and no wisdom.&nbsp; Hai!&nbsp;
I!

<P>even I, was given in gift by a chief and a warrior to a man that

<P>was neither.&nbsp; Hai!&nbsp; Hai!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wailed to herself softly, lamenting the lost possibilities of

<P>murder and mischief that could have fallen to her lot had she

<P>been mated with a congenial spirit.&nbsp; Nina bent down over Mrs.

<P>Almayer's slight form and scanned attentively, under the stars

<P>that had rushed out on the black sky and now hung breathless over

<P>that strange parting, her mother's shrivelled features, and

<P>looked close into the sunken eyes that could see into her own

<P>dark future by the light of a long and a painful experience.

<P>Again she felt herself fascinated, as of old, by her mother's

<P>exalted mood and by the oracular certainty of expression which,

<P>together with her fits of violence, had contributed not a little

<P>to the reputation for witchcraft she enjoyed in the settlement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was a slave, and you shall be a queen," went on Mrs. Almayer,

<P>looking straight before her; "but remember men's strength and

<P>their weakness.&nbsp; Tremble before his anger, so that he may see

<P>your fear in the light of day; but in your heart you may laugh,

<P>for after sunset he is your slave."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A slave!&nbsp; He!&nbsp; The master of life!&nbsp; You do not know
him,

<P>mother."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer condescended to laugh contemptuously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You speak like a fool of a white woman," she exclaimed.&nbsp; "What

<P>do you know of men's anger and of men's love?&nbsp; Have you watched

<P>the sleep of men weary of dealing death?&nbsp; Have you felt about you

<P>the strong arm that could drive a kriss deep into a beating

<P>heart?&nbsp; Yah! you are a white woman, and ought to pray to a

<P>woman-god!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why do you say this?&nbsp; I have listened to your words so long that

<P>I have forgotten my old life.&nbsp; If I was white would I stand here,

<P>ready to go?&nbsp; Mother, I shall return to the house and look once

<P>more at my father's face."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No!" said Mrs. Almayer, violently.&nbsp; "No, he sleeps now the sleep

<P>of gin; and if you went back he might awake and see you.&nbsp; No, he

<P>shall never see you.&nbsp; When the terrible old man took you away

<P>from me when you were little, you remember--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was such a long time ago," murmured Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I remember," went on Mrs. Almayer, fiercely.&nbsp; "I wanted to look

<P>at your face again.&nbsp; He said no!&nbsp; I heard you cry and jumped
into

<P>the river.&nbsp; You were his daughter then; you are my daughter now.

<P>Never shall you go back to that house; you shall never cross this

<P>courtyard again.&nbsp; No! no!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her voice rose almost to a shout.&nbsp; On the other side of the creek

<P>there was a rustle in the long grass.&nbsp; The two women heard it,

<P>and listened for a while in startled silence.&nbsp; "I shall go," said

<P>Nina, in a cautious but intense whisper.&nbsp; "What is your hate or

<P>your revenge to me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She moved towards the house, Mrs. Almayer clinging to her and

<P>trying to pull her back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop, you shall not go!" she gasped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina pushed away her mother impatiently and gathered up her

<P>skirts for a quick run, but Mrs. Almayer ran forward and turned

<P>round, facing her daughter with outstretched arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you move another step," she exclaimed, breathing quickly, "I

<P>shall cry out.&nbsp; Do you see those lights in the big house?&nbsp;
There

<P>sit two white men, angry because they cannot have the blood of

<P>the man you love.&nbsp; And in those dark houses," she continued, more

<P>calmly as she pointed towards the settlement, "my voice could

<P>wake up men that would lead the Orang Blanda soldiers to him who

<P>is waiting--for you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not see her daughter's face, but the white figure

<P>before her stood silent and irresolute in the darkness.&nbsp; Mrs.

<P>Almayer pursued her advantage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Give up your old life!&nbsp; Forget!" she said in entreating tones.

<P>"Forget that you ever looked at a white face; forget their words;

<P>forget their thoughts.&nbsp; They speak lies.&nbsp; And they think lies

<P>because they despise us that are better than they are, but not so

<P>strong.&nbsp; Forget their friendship and their contempt; forget their

<P>many gods.&nbsp; Girl, why do you want to remember the past when there

<P>is a warrior and a chief ready to give many lives--his own life--

<P>for one of your smiles?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While she spoke she pushed gently her daughter towards the

<P>canoes, hiding her own fear, anxiety, and doubt under the flood

<P>of passionate words that left Nina no time to think and no

<P>opportunity to protest, even if she had wished it.&nbsp; But she did

<P>not wish it now.&nbsp; At the bottom of that passing desire to look

<P>again at her father's face there was no strong affection.&nbsp; She

<P>felt no scruples and no remorse at leaving suddenly that man

<P>whose sentiment towards herself she could not understand, she

<P>could not even see.&nbsp; There was only an instinctive clinging to

<P>old life, to old habits, to old faces; that fear of finality

<P>which lurks in every human breast and prevents so many heroisms

<P>and so many crimes.&nbsp; For years she had stood between her mother

<P>and her father, the one so strong in her weakness, the other so

<P>weak where he could have been strong.&nbsp; Between those two beings

<P>so dissimilar, so antagonistic, she stood with mute heart

<P>wondering and angry at the fact of her own existence.&nbsp; It seemed

<P>so unreasonable, so humiliating to be flung there in that

<P>settlement and to see the days rush by into the past, without a

<P>hope, a desire, or an aim that would justify the life she had to

<P>endure in ever-growing weariness.&nbsp; She had little belief and no

<P>sympathy for her father's dreams; but the savage ravings of her

<P>mother chanced to strike a responsive chord, deep down somewhere

<P>in her despairing heart; and she dreamed dreams of her own with

<P>the persistent absorption of a captive thinking of liberty within

<P>the walls of his prison cell.&nbsp; With the coming of Dain she found

<P>the road to freedom by obeying the voice of the new-born

<P>impulses, and with surprised joy she thought she could read in

<P>his eyes the answer to all the questionings of her heart.&nbsp; She

<P>understood now the reason and the aim of life; and in the

<P>triumphant unveiling of that mystery she threw away disdainfully

<P>her past with its sad thoughts, its bitter feelings, and its

<P>faint affections, now withered and dead in contact with her

<P>fierce passion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer unmoored Nina's own canoe and, straightening herself

<P>painfully, stood, painter in hand, looking at her daughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Quick," she said; "get away before the moon rises, while the

<P>river is dark.&nbsp; I am afraid of Abdulla's slaves.&nbsp; The wretches

<P>prowl in the night often, and might see and follow you.&nbsp; There

<P>are two paddles in the canoe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina approached her mother and hesitatingly touched lightly with

<P>her lips the wrinkled forehead.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer snorted

<P>contemptuously in protest against that tenderness which she,

<P>nevertheless, feared could be contagious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I ever see you again, mother?" murmured Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Mrs. Almayer, after a short silence.&nbsp; "Why should you

<P>return here where it is my fate to die?&nbsp; You will live far away

<P>in splendour and might.&nbsp; When I hear of white men driven from the

<P>islands, then I shall know that you are alive, and that you

<P>remember my words."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall always remember," returned Nina, earnestly; "but where

<P>is my power, and what can I do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not let him look too long in your eyes, nor lay his head on

<P>your knees without reminding him that men should fight before

<P>they rest.&nbsp; And if he lingers, give him his kriss yourself and

<P>bid him go, as the wife of a mighty prince should do when the

<P>enemies are near.&nbsp; Let him slay the white men that come to us to

<P>trade, with prayers on their lips and loaded guns in their hands.

<P>Ah!"--she ended with a sigh--"they are on every sea, and on every

<P>shore; and they are very many!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She swung the bow of the canoe towards the river, but did not let

<P>go the gunwale, keeping her hand on it in irresolute

<P>thoughtfulness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina put the point of the paddle against the bank, ready to shove

<P>off into the stream.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is it, mother?" she asked, in a low voice.&nbsp; "Do you hear

<P>anything?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Mrs. Almayer, absently.&nbsp; "Listen, Nina," she

<P>continued, abruptly, after a slight pause, "in after years there

<P>will be other women--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A stifled cry in the boat interrupted her, and the paddle rattled

<P>in the canoe as it slipped from Nina's hands, which she put out

<P>in a protesting gesture.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer fell on her knees on the

<P>bank and leaned over the gunwale so as to bring her own face

<P>close to her daughter's.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There will be other women," she repeated firmly; "I tell you

<P>that, because you are half white, and may forget that he is a

<P>great chief, and that such things must be.&nbsp; Hide your anger, and

<P>do not let him see on your face the pain that will eat your

<P>heart.&nbsp; Meet him with joy in your eyes and wisdom on your lips,

<P>for to you he will turn in sadness or in doubt.&nbsp; As long as he

<P>looks upon many women your power will last, but should there be

<P>one, one only with whom he seems to forget you, then--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I could not live," exclaimed Nina, covering her face with both

<P>her hands.&nbsp; "Do not speak so, mother; it could not be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then," went on Mrs. Almayer, steadily, "to that woman, Nina,

<P>show no mercy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She moved the canoe down towards the stream by the gunwale, and

<P>gripped it with both her hands, the bow pointing into the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you crying?" she asked sternly of her daughter, who sat

<P>still with covered face.&nbsp; "Arise, and take your paddle, for he

<P>has waited long enough.&nbsp; And remember, Nina, no mercy; and if you

<P>must strike, strike with a steady hand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She put out all her strength, and swinging her body over the

<P>water, shot the light craft far into the stream.&nbsp; When she

<P>recovered herself from the effort she tried vainly to catch a

<P>glimpse of the canoe that seemed to have dissolved suddenly into

<P>the white mist trailing over the heated waters of the Pantai.

<P>After listening for a while intently on her knees, Mrs. Almayer

<P>rose with a deep sigh, while two tears wandered slowly down her

<P>withered cheeks.&nbsp; She wiped them off quickly with a wisp of her

<P>grey hair as if ashamed of herself, but could not stifle another

<P>loud sigh, for her heart was heavy and she suffered much, being

<P>unused to tender emotions.&nbsp; This time she fancied she had heard
a

<P>faint noise, like the echo of her own sigh, and she stopped,

<P>straining her ears to catch the slightest sound, and peering

<P>apprehensively towards the bushes near her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who is there?" she asked, in an unsteady voice, while her

<P>imagination peopled the solitude of the riverside with ghost-like

<P>forms.&nbsp; "Who is there?" she repeated faintly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no answer:&nbsp; only the voice of the river murmuring in

<P>sad monotone behind the white veil seemed to swell louder for a

<P>moment, to die away again in a soft whisper of eddies washing

<P>against the bank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer shook her head as if in answer to her own thoughts,

<P>and walked quickly away from the bushes, looking to the right and

<P>left watchfully.&nbsp; She went straight towards the cooking-shed,

<P>observing that the embers of the fire there glowed more brightly

<P>than usual, as if somebody had been adding fresh fuel to the

<P>fires during the evening.&nbsp; As she approached, Babalatchi, who had

<P>been squatting in the warm glow, rose and met her in the shadow

<P>outside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is she gone?" asked the anxious statesman, hastily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," answered Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; "What are the white men doing?

<P>When did you leave them?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are sleeping now, I think.&nbsp; May they never wake!" exclaimed

<P>Babalatchi, fervently.&nbsp; "Oh! but they are devils, and made much

<P>talk and trouble over that carcase.&nbsp; The chief threatened me

<P>twice with his hand, and said he would have me tied up to a tree.

<P>Tie me up to a tree!&nbsp; Me!" he repeated, striking his breast

<P>violently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer laughed tauntingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you salaamed and asked for mercy.&nbsp; Men with arms by their

<P>side acted otherwise when I was young."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And where are they, the men of your youth?&nbsp; You mad woman!"

<P>retorted Babalatchi, angrily.&nbsp; "Killed by the Dutch.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp;
But I

<P>shall live to deceive them.&nbsp; A man knows when to fight and when

<P>to tell peaceful lies.&nbsp; You would know that if you were not a

<P>woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Mrs. Almayer did not seem to hear him.&nbsp; With bent body and

<P>outstretched arm she appeared to be listening to some noise

<P>behind the shed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There are strange sounds," she whispered, with evident alarm.

<P>"I have heard in the air the sounds of grief, as of a sigh and

<P>weeping.&nbsp; That was by the riverside.&nbsp; And now again I heard--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where?" asked Babalatchi, in an altered voice.&nbsp; "What did you

<P>hear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Close here.&nbsp; It was like a breath long drawn.&nbsp; I wish I had

<P>burnt the paper over the body before it was buried."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," assented Babalatchi.&nbsp; "But the white men had him thrown

<P>into a hole at once.&nbsp; You know he found his death on the river,"

<P>he added cheerfully, "and his ghost may hail the canoes, but

<P>would leave the land alone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer, who had been craning her neck to look round the

<P>corner of the shed, drew back her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is nobody there," she said, reassured.&nbsp; "Is it not time

<P>for the Rajah war-canoe to go to the clearing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have been waiting for it here, for I myself must go,"

<P>explained Babalatchi.&nbsp; "I think I will go over and see what makes

<P>them late.&nbsp; When will you come?&nbsp; The Rajah gives you refuge."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall paddle over before the break of day.&nbsp; I cannot leave my

<P>dollars behind," muttered Mrs. Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They separated.&nbsp; Babalatchi crossed the courtyard towards the

<P>creek to get his canoe, and Mrs. Almayer walked slowly to the

<P>house, ascended the plankway, and passing through the back

<P>verandah entered the passage leading to the front of the house;

<P>but before going in she turned in the doorway and looked back at

<P>the empty and silent courtyard, now lit up by the rays of the

<P>rising moon.&nbsp; No sooner she had disappeared, however, than a

<P>vague shape flitted out from amongst the stalks of the banana

<P>plantation, darted over the moonlit space, and fell in the

<P>darkness at the foot of the verandah.&nbsp; It might have been the

<P>shadow of a driving cloud, so noiseless and rapid was its

<P>passage, but for the trail of disturbed grass, whose feathery

<P>heads trembled and swayed for a long time in the moonlight before

<P>they rested motionless and gleaming, like a design of silver

<P>sprays embroidered on a sombre background.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer lighted the cocoanut lamp, and lifting cautiously

<P>the red curtain, gazed upon her husband, shading the light with

<P>her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer, huddled up in the chair, one of his arms hanging down,

<P>the other thrown across the lower part of his face as if to ward

<P>off an invisible enemy, his legs stretched straight out, slept

<P>heavily, unconscious of the unfriendly eyes that looked upon him

<P>in disparaging criticism.&nbsp; At his feet lay the overturned table,

<P>amongst a wreck of crockery and broken bottles.&nbsp; The appearance

<P>as of traces left by a desperate struggle was accentuated by the

<P>chairs, which seemed to have been scattered violently all over

<P>the place, and now lay about the verandah with a lamentable

<P>aspect of inebriety in their helpless attitudes.&nbsp; Only Nina's big

<P>rocking-chair, standing black and motionless on its high runners,

<P>towered above the chaos of demoralised furniture, unflinchingly

<P>dignified and patient, waiting for its burden.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a last scornful look towards the sleeper, Mrs. Almayer

<P>passed behind the curtain into her own room.&nbsp; A couple of bats,

<P>encouraged by the darkness and the peaceful state of affairs,

<P>resumed their silent and oblique gambols above Almayer's head,

<P>and for a long time the profound quiet of the house was unbroken,

<P>save for the deep breathing of the sleeping man and the faint

<P>tinkle of silver in the hands of the woman preparing for flight.

<P>In the increasing light of the moon that had risen now above the

<P>night mist, the objects on the verandah came out strongly

<P>outlined in black splashes of shadow with all the uncompromising

<P>ugliness of their disorder, and a caricature of the sleeping

<P>Almayer appeared on the dirty whitewash of the wall behind him in

<P>a grotesquely exaggerated detail of attitude and feature enlarged

<P>to a heroic size.&nbsp; The discontented bats departed in quest of

<P>darker places, and a lizard came out in short, nervous rushes,

<P>and, pleased with the white table-cloth, stopped on it in

<P>breathless immobility that would have suggested sudden death had

<P>it not been for the melodious call he exchanged with a less

<P>adventurous friend hiding amongst the lumber in the courtyard.

<P>Then the boards in the passage creaked, the lizard vanished, and

<P>Almayer stirred uneasily with a sigh:&nbsp; slowly, out of the

<P>senseless annihilation of drunken sleep, he was returning,

<P>through the land of dreams, to waking consciousness.&nbsp; Almayer's

<P>head rolled from shoulder to shoulder in the oppression of his

<P>dream; the heavens had descended upon him like a heavy mantle,

<P>and trailed in starred folds far under him.&nbsp; Stars above, stars

<P>all round him; and from the stars under his feet rose a whisper

<P>full of entreaties and tears, and sorrowful faces flitted amongst

<P>the clusters of light filling the infinite space below.&nbsp; How

<P>escape from the importunity of lamentable cries and from the look

<P>of staring, sad eyes in the faces which pressed round him till he

<P>gasped for breath under the crushing weight of worlds that hung

<P>over his aching shoulders?&nbsp; Get away!&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; If he
attempted

<P>to move he would step off into nothing, and perish in the

<P>crashing fall of that universe of which he was the only support.

<P>And what were the voices saying?&nbsp; Urging him to move!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Move

<P>to destruction!&nbsp; Not likely!&nbsp; The absurdity of the thing filled

<P>him with indignation.&nbsp; He got a firmer foothold and stiffened his

<P>muscles in heroic resolve to carry his burden to all eternity.

<P>And ages passed in the superhuman labour, amidst the rush of

<P>circling worlds; in the plaintive murmur of sorrowful voices

<P>urging him to desist before it was too late--till the mysterious

<P>power that had laid upon him the giant task seemed at last to

<P>seek his destruction.&nbsp; With terror he felt an irresistible hand

<P>shaking him by the shoulder, while the chorus of voices swelled

<P>louder into an agonised prayer to go, go before it is too late.

<P>He felt himself slipping, losing his balance, as something

<P>dragged at his legs, and he fell.&nbsp; With a faint cry he glided out

<P>of the anguish of perishing creation into an imperfect waking

<P>that seemed to be still under the spell of his dream.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?&nbsp; What?" he murmured sleepily, without moving or opening

<P>his eyes.&nbsp; His head still felt heavy, and he had not the courage

<P>to raise his eyelids.&nbsp; In his ears there still lingered the sound

<P>of entreating whisper.--"Am I awake?--Why do I hear the voices?"

<P>he argued to himself, hazily.--"I cannot get rid of the horrible

<P>nightmare yet.--I have been very drunk.--What is that shaking me?

<P>I am dreaming yet--I must open my eyes and be done with it.&nbsp; I
am

<P>only half awake, it is evident."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made an effort to shake off his stupor and saw a face close to

<P>his, glaring at him with staring eyeballs.&nbsp; He closed his eyes

<P>again in amazed horror and sat up straight in the chair,

<P>trembling in every limb.&nbsp; What was this apparition?--His own

<P>fancy, no doubt.--His nerves had been much tried the day

<P>before--and then the drink!&nbsp; He would not see it again if he had

<P>the courage to look.--He would look directly.--Get a little

<P>steadier first.-- So.--Now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked.&nbsp; The figure of a woman standing in the steely light,

<P>her hands stretched forth in a suppliant gesture, confronted him

<P>from the far-off end of the verandah; and in the space between

<P>him and the obstinate phantom floated the murmur of words that

<P>fell on his ears in a jumble of torturing sentences, the meaning

<P>of which escaped the utmost efforts of his brain.&nbsp; Who spoke the

<P>Malay words?&nbsp; Who ran away?&nbsp; Why too late--and too late for
what?

<P>What meant those words of hate and love mixed so strangely

<P>together, the ever-recurring names falling on his ears again and

<P>again--Nina, Dain; Dain, Nina?&nbsp; Dain was dead, and Nina was

<P>sleeping, unaware of the terrible experience through which he was

<P>now passing.&nbsp; Was he going to be tormented for ever, sleeping or

<P>waking, and have no peace either night or day?&nbsp; What was the

<P>meaning of this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shouted the last words aloud.&nbsp; The shadowy woman seemed to

<P>shrink and recede a little from him towards the doorway, and

<P>there was a shriek.&nbsp; Exasperated by the incomprehensible nature

<P>of his torment, Almayer made a rush upon the apparition, which

<P>eluded his grasp, and he brought up heavily against the wall.

<P>Quick as lightning he turned round and pursued fiercely the

<P>mysterious figure fleeing from him with piercing shrieks that

<P>were like fuel to the flames of his anger.&nbsp; Over the furniture,

<P>round the overturned table, and now he had it cornered behind

<P>Nina's chair.&nbsp; To the left, to the right they dodged, the chair

<P>rocking madly between them, she sending out shriek after shriek

<P>at every feint, and he growling meaningless curses through his

<P>hard set teeth.&nbsp; "Oh! the fiendish noise that split his head and

<P>seemed to choke his breath.--It would kill him.--It must be

<P>stopped!"&nbsp; An insane desire to crush that yelling thing induced

<P>him to cast himself recklessly over the chair with a desperate

<P>grab, and they came down together in a cloud of dust amongst the

<P>splintered wood.&nbsp; The last shriek died out under him in a faint

<P>gurgle, and he had secured the relief of absolute silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked at the woman's face under him.&nbsp; A real woman!&nbsp; He
knew

<P>her.&nbsp; By all that is wonderful!&nbsp; Taminah!&nbsp; He jumped
up ashamed

<P>of his fury and stood perplexed, wiping his forehead.&nbsp; The girl

<P>struggled to a kneeling posture and embraced his legs in a

<P>frenzied prayer for mercy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be afraid," he said, raising her.&nbsp; "I shall not hurt you.

<P>Why do you come to my house in the night?&nbsp; And if you had to

<P>come, why not go behind the curtain where the women sleep?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The place behind the curtain is empty," gasped Taminah, catching

<P>her breath between the words.&nbsp; "There are no women in your house

<P>any more, Tuan.&nbsp; I saw the old Mem go away before I tried to wake

<P>you.&nbsp; I did not want your women, I wanted you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Old Mem!" repeated Almayer.&nbsp; "Do you mean my wife?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She nodded her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But of my daughter you are not afraid?" said Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you not heard me?" she exclaimed.&nbsp; "Have I not spoken for
a

<P>long time when you lay there with eyes half open?&nbsp; She is gone

<P>too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was asleep.&nbsp; Can you not tell when a man is sleeping and when

<P>awake?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sometimes," answered Taminah in a low voice; "sometimes the

<P>spirit lingers close to a sleeping body and may hear.&nbsp; I spoke
a

<P>long time before I touched you, and I spoke softly for fear it

<P>would depart at a sudden noise and leave you sleeping for ever.

<P>I took you by the shoulder only when you began to mutter words I

<P>could not understand.&nbsp; Have you not heard, then, and do you know

<P>nothing?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing of what you said.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Tell again if you
want

<P>me to know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He took her by the shoulder and led her unresisting to the front

<P>of the verandah into a stronger light.&nbsp; She wrung her hands with

<P>such an appearance of grief that he began to be alarmed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Speak," he said.&nbsp; "You made noise enough to wake even dead men.

<P>And yet nobody living came," he added to himself in an uneasy

<P>whisper.&nbsp; "Are you mute?&nbsp; Speak!" he repeated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a rush of words which broke out after a short struggle from

<P>her trembling lips she told him the tale of Nina's love and her

<P>own jealousy.&nbsp; Several times he looked angrily into her face and

<P>told her to be silent; but he could not stop the sounds that

<P>seemed to him to run out in a hot stream, swirl about his feet,

<P>and rise in scalding waves about him, higher, higher, drowning

<P>his heart, touching his lips with a feel of molten lead, blotting

<P>out his sight in scorching vapour, closing over his head,

<P>merciless and deadly.&nbsp; When she spoke of the deception as to

<P>Dain's death of which he had been the victim only that day, he

<P>glanced again at her with terrible eyes, and made her falter for

<P>a second, but he turned away directly, and his face suddenly lost

<P>all expression in a stony stare far away over the river.&nbsp; Ah! the

<P>river!&nbsp; His old friend and his old enemy, speaking always with

<P>the same voice as he runs from year to year bringing fortune or

<P>disappointment happiness or pain, upon the same varying but

<P>unchanged surface of glancing currents and swirling eddies.&nbsp; For

<P>many years he had listened to the passionless and soothing murmur

<P>that sometimes was the song of hope, at times the song of

<P>triumph, of encouragement; more often the whisper of consolation

<P>that spoke of better days to come.&nbsp; For so many years!&nbsp; So
many

<P>years!&nbsp; And now to the accompaniment of that murmur he listened

<P>to the slow and painful beating of his heart.&nbsp; He listened

<P>attentively, wondering at the regularity of its beats.&nbsp; He began

<P>to count mechanically.&nbsp; One, two.&nbsp; Why count?&nbsp; At the
next beat

<P>it must stop.&nbsp; No heart could suffer so and beat so steadily for

<P>long.&nbsp; Those regular strokes as of a muffled hammer that rang in

<P>his ears must stop soon.&nbsp; Still beating unceasing and cruel.&nbsp;
No

<P>man can bear this; and is this the last, or will the next one be

<P>the last?--How much longer?&nbsp; O God! how much longer?&nbsp; His
hand

<P>weighed heavier unconsciously on the girl's shoulder, and she

<P>spoke the last words of her story crouching at his feet with

<P>tears of pain and shame and anger.&nbsp; Was her revenge to fail her?

<P>This white man was like a senseless stone.&nbsp; Too late!&nbsp; Too
late!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you saw her go?" Almayer's voice sounded harshly above her

<P>head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did I not tell you?" she sobbed, trying to wriggle gently out

<P>from under his grip.&nbsp; "Did I not tell you that I saw the

<P>witchwoman push the canoe?&nbsp; I lay hidden in the grass and heard

<P>all the words.&nbsp; She that we used to call the white Mem wanted to

<P>return to look at your face, but the witchwoman forbade her,

<P>and--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She sank lower yet on her elbow, turning half round under the

<P>downward push of the heavy hand, her face lifted up to him with

<P>spiteful eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And she obeyed," she shouted out in a half-laugh, half-cry of

<P>pain.&nbsp; "Let me go, Tuan.&nbsp; Why are you angry with me?&nbsp;
Hasten, or

<P>you shall be too late to show your anger to the deceitful woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer dragged her up to her feet and looked close into her face

<P>while she struggled, turning her head away from his wild stare.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who sent you here to torment me?" he asked, violently.&nbsp; "I do

<P>not believe you.&nbsp; You lie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He straightened his arm suddenly and flung her across the

<P>verandah towards the doorway, where she lay immobile and silent,

<P>as if she had left her life in his grasp, a dark heap, without a

<P>sound or a stir.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! Nina!" whispered Almayer, in a voice in which reproach and

<P>love spoke together in pained tenderness.&nbsp; "Oh!&nbsp; Nina!&nbsp;
I do not

<P>believe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A light draught from the river ran over the courtyard in a wave

<P>of bowing grass and, entering the verandah, touched Almayer's

<P>forehead with its cool breath, in a caress of infinite pity.&nbsp; The

<P>curtain in the women's doorway blew out and instantly collapsed

<P>with startling helplessness.&nbsp; He stared at the fluttering stuff.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nina!" cried Almayer.&nbsp; "Where are you, Nina?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wind passed out of the empty house in a tremulous sigh, and

<P>all was still.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer hid his face in his hands as if to shut out a loathsome

<P>sight.&nbsp; When, hearing a slight rustle, he uncovered his eyes, the

<P>dark heap by the door was gone.
