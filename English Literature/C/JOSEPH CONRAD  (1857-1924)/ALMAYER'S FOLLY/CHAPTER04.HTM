<P>That year, towards the breaking up of the south-west monsoon,

<P>disquieting rumours reached Sambir.&nbsp; Captain Ford, coming up to

<P>Almayer's house for an evening's chat, brought late numbers of

<P>the Straits Times giving the news of Acheen war and of the

<P>unsuccessful Dutch expedition.&nbsp; The Nakhodas of the rare trading

<P>praus ascending the river paid visits to Lakamba, discussing with

<P>that potentate the unsettled state of affairs, and wagged their

<P>heads gravely over the recital of Orang Blanda exaction,

<P>severity, and general tyranny, as exemplified in the total

<P>stoppage of gunpowder trade and the rigorous visiting of all

<P>suspicious craft trading in the straits of Macassar.&nbsp; Even the

<P>loyal soul of Lakamba was stirred into a state of inward

<P>discontent by the withdrawal of his license for powder and by the

<P>abrupt confiscation of one hundred and fifty barrels of that

<P>commodity by the gunboat Princess Amelia, when, after a hazardous

<P>voyage, it had almost reached the mouth of the river.&nbsp; The

<P>unpleasant news was given him by Reshid, who, after the

<P>unsuccessful issue of his matrimonial projects, had made a long

<P>voyage amongst the islands for trading purposes; had bought the

<P>powder for his friend, and was overhauled and deprived of it on

<P>his return when actually congratulating himself on his acuteness

<P>in avoiding detection.&nbsp; Reshid's wrath was principally directed

<P>against Almayer, whom he suspected of having notified the Dutch

<P>authorities of the desultory warfare carried on by the Arabs and

<P>the Rajah with the up-river Dyak tribes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Reshid's great surprise the Rajah received his complaints very

<P>coldly, and showed no signs of vengeful disposition towards the

<P>white man.&nbsp; In truth, Lakamba knew very well that Almayer was

<P>perfectly innocent of any meddling in state affairs; and besides,

<P>his attitude towards that much persecuted individual was wholly

<P>changed in&nbsp; consequence of a reconciliation effected between him

<P>and his old enemy by Almayer's newly-found friend, Dain Maroola.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer had now a friend.&nbsp; Shortly after Reshid's departure on

<P>his commercial journey, Nina, drifting slowly with the tide in

<P>the canoe on her return home after one of her solitary

<P>excursions, heard in one of the small creeks a splashing, as if

<P>of heavy ropes dropping in the water, and the prolonged song of

<P>Malay seamen when some heavy pulling is to be done.&nbsp; Through the

<P>thick fringe of bushes hiding the mouth of the creek she saw the

<P>tall spars of some European-rigged sailing vessel overtopping the

<P>summits of the Nipa palms.&nbsp; A brig was being hauled out of the

<P>small creek into the main stream.&nbsp; The sun had set, and during

<P>the short moments of twilight Nina saw the brig, aided by the

<P>evening breeze and the flowing tide, head towards Sambir under

<P>her set foresail.&nbsp; The girl turned her canoe out of the main

<P>river into one of the many narrow channels amongst the wooded

<P>islets, and paddled vigorously over the black and sleepy

<P>backwaters towards Sambir.&nbsp; Her canoe brushed the water-palms,

<P>skirted the short spaces of muddy bank where sedate alligators

<P>looked at her with lazy unconcern, and, just as darkness was

<P>setting in, shot out into the broad junction of the two main

<P>branches of the river, where the brig was already at anchor with

<P>sails furled, yards squared, and decks seemingly untenanted by

<P>any human being.&nbsp; Nina had to cross the river and pass pretty

<P>close to the brig in order to reach home on the low promontory

<P>between the two branches of the Pantai.&nbsp; Up both branches, in the

<P>houses built on the banks and over the water, the lights twinkled

<P>already, reflected in the still waters below.&nbsp; The hum of voices,

<P>the occasional cry of a child, the rapid and abruptly interrupted

<P>roll of a wooden drum, together with some distant hailing in the

<P>darkness by the returning fishermen, reached her over the broad

<P>expanse of the river.&nbsp; She hesitated a little before crossing,

<P>the sight of such an unusual object as an European-rigged vessel

<P>causing her some uneasiness, but the river in its wide expansion

<P>was dark enough to render a small canoe invisible.&nbsp; She urged her

<P>small craft with swift strokes of her paddle, kneeling in the

<P>bottom and bending forward to catch any suspicious sound while

<P>she steered towards the little jetty of Lingard and Co., to which

<P>the strong light of the paraffin lamp shining on the whitewashed

<P>verandah of Almayer's bungalow served as a convenient guide.&nbsp; The

<P>jetty itself, under the shadow of the bank overgrown by drooping

<P>bushes, was hidden in darkness.&nbsp; Before even she could see it she

<P>heard the hollow bumping of a large boat against its rotten

<P>posts, and heard also the murmur of whispered conversation in

<P>that boat whose white paint and great dimensions, faintly visible

<P>on nearer approach, made her rightly guess that it belonged to

<P>the brig just anchored.&nbsp; Stopping her course by a rapid motion
of

<P>her paddle, with another swift stroke she sent it whirling away

<P>from the wharf and steered for a little rivulet which gave access

<P>to the back courtyard of the house.&nbsp; She landed at the muddy head

<P>of the creek and made her way towards the house over the trodden

<P>grass of the courtyard.&nbsp; To the left, from the cooking shed,

<P>shone a red glare through the banana plantation she skirted, and

<P>the noise of feminine laughter reached her from there in the

<P>silent evening.&nbsp; She rightly judged her mother was not near,

<P>laughter and Mrs. Almayer not being close neighbours.&nbsp; She must

<P>be in the house, thought Nina, as she ran lightly up the inclined

<P>plane of shaky planks leading to the back door of the narrow

<P>passage dividing the house in two.&nbsp; Outside the doorway, in the

<P>black shadow, stood the faithful Ali.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who is there?" asked Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A great Malay man has come," answered Ali, in a tone of

<P>suppressed excitement.&nbsp; "He is a rich man.&nbsp; There are six
men

<P>with lances.&nbsp; Real Soldat, you understand.&nbsp; And his dress
is very

<P>brave.&nbsp; I have seen his dress.&nbsp; It shines!&nbsp; What jewels!&nbsp;
Don't

<P>go there, Mem Nina.&nbsp; Tuan said not; but the old Mem is gone.

<P>Tuan will be angry.&nbsp; Merciful Allah! what jewels that man has

<P>got!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina slipped past the outstretched hand of the slave into the

<P>dark passage where, in the crimson glow of the hanging curtain,

<P>close by its other end, she could see a small dark form crouching

<P>near the wall.&nbsp; Her mother was feasting her eyes and ears with

<P>what was taking place on the front verandah, and Nina approached

<P>to take her share in the rare pleasure of some novelty.&nbsp; She was

<P>met by her mother's extended arm and by a low murmured warning

<P>not to make a noise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you seen them, mother?" asked Nina, in a breathless

<P>whisper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer turned her face towards the girl, and her sunken

<P>eyes shone strangely in the red half-light of the passage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I saw him," she said, in an almost inaudible tone, pressing her

<P>daughter's hand with her bony fingers.&nbsp; "A great Rajah has come

<P>to Sambir--a Son of Heaven," muttered the old woman to herself.

<P>"Go away, girl!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two women stood close to the curtain, Nina wishing to

<P>approach the rent in the stuff, and her mother defending the

<P>position with angry obstinacy.&nbsp; On the other side there was a

<P>lull in the conversation, but the breathing of several men, the

<P>occasional light tinkling of some ornaments, the clink of metal

<P>scabbards, or of brass siri-vessels passed from hand to hand, was

<P>audible during the short pause.&nbsp; The women struggled silently,

<P>when there was a shuffling noise and the shadow of Almayer's

<P>burly form fell on the curtain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The women ceased struggling and remained motionless.&nbsp; Almayer had

<P>stood up to answer his guest, turning his back to the doorway,

<P>unaware of what was going on on the other side.&nbsp; He spoke in a

<P>tone of regretful irritation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have come to the wrong house, Tuan Maroola, if you want to

<P>trade as you say.&nbsp; I was a trader once, not now, whatever you may

<P>have heard about me in Macassar.&nbsp; And if you want anything, you

<P>will not find it here; I have nothing to give, and want nothing

<P>myself.&nbsp; You should go to the Rajah here; you can see in the

<P>daytime his houses across the river, there, where those fires are

<P>burning on the shore.&nbsp; He will help you and trade with you.&nbsp;
Or,

<P>better still, go to the Arabs over there," he went on bitterly,

<P>pointing with his hand towards the houses of Sambir.&nbsp; "Abdulla
is

<P>the man you want.&nbsp; There is nothing he would not buy, and there

<P>is nothing he would not sell; believe me, I know him well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He waited for an answer a short time, then added--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All that I have said is true, and there is nothing more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina, held back by her mother, heard a soft voice reply with a

<P>calm evenness of intonation peculiar to the better class Malays--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who would doubt a white Tuan's words?&nbsp; A man seeks his friends

<P>where his heart tells him.&nbsp; Is this not true also?&nbsp; I have
come,

<P>although so late, for I have something to say which you may be

<P>glad to hear.&nbsp; To-morrow I will go to the Sultan; a trader wants

<P>the friendship of great men.&nbsp; Then I shall return here to speak

<P>serious words, if Tuan permits.&nbsp; I shall not go to the Arabs;

<P>their lies are very great!&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; Chelakka!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer's voice sounded a little more pleasantly in reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, as you like.&nbsp; I can hear you to-morrow at any time if you

<P>have anything to say.&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; After you have seen the Sultan

<P>Lakamba you will not want to return here, Inchi Dain.&nbsp; You will

<P>see.&nbsp; Only mind, I will have nothing to do with Lakamba.&nbsp;
You may

<P>tell him so.&nbsp; What is your business with me, after all?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To-morrow we talk, Tuan, now I know you," answered the Malay.

<P>"I speak English a little, so we can talk and nobody will

<P>understand, and then--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He interrupted himself suddenly, asking surprised, "What's that

<P>noise, Tuan?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer had also heard the increasing noise of the scuffle

<P>recommenced on the women's side of the curtain.&nbsp; Evidently Nina's

<P>strong curiosity was on the point of overcoming Mrs. Almayer's

<P>exalted sense of social proprieties.&nbsp; Hard breathing was

<P>distinctly audible, and the curtain shook during the contest,

<P>which was mainly physical, although Mrs. Almayer's voice was

<P>heard in angry remonstrance with its usual want of strictly

<P>logical reasoning, but with the well-known richness of invective.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You shameless woman!&nbsp; Are you a slave?" shouted shrilly the

<P>irate matron.&nbsp; "Veil your face, abandoned wretch!&nbsp; You white

<P>snake, I will not let you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer's face expressed annoyance and also doubt as to the

<P>advisability of interfering between mother and daughter.&nbsp; He

<P>glanced at his Malay visitor, who was waiting silently for the

<P>end of the uproar in an attitude of amused expectation, and

<P>waving his hand contemptuously he murmured--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is nothing.&nbsp; Some women."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Malay nodded his head gravely, and his face assumed an

<P>expression of serene indifference, as etiquette demanded after

<P>such an explanation.&nbsp; The contest was ended behind the curtain,

<P>and evidently the younger will had its way, for the rapid shuffle

<P>and click of Mrs. Almayer's high-heeled sandals died away in the

<P>distance.&nbsp; The tranquillised master of the house was going to

<P>resume the conversation when, struck by an unexpected change in

<P>the expression of his guest's countenance, he turned his head and

<P>saw Nina standing in the doorway.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After Mrs. Almayer's retreat from the field of battle, Nina, with

<P>a contemptuous exclamation, "It's only a trader," had lifted the

<P>conquered curtain and now stood in full light, framed in the dark

<P>background on the passage, her lips slightly parted, her hair in

<P>disorder after the exertion, the angry gleam not yet faded out of

<P>her glorious and sparkling eyes.&nbsp; She took in at a glance the

<P>group of white-clad lancemen standing motionless in the shadow of

<P>the far-off end of the verandah, and her gaze rested curiously on

<P>the chief of that imposing cortege.&nbsp; He stood, almost facing her,

<P>a little on one side, and struck by the beauty of the unexpected

<P>apparition had bent low, elevating his joint hands above his head

<P>in a sign of respect accorded by Malays only to the great of this

<P>earth.&nbsp; The crude light of the lamp shone on the gold embroidery

<P>of his black silk jacket, broke in a thousand sparkling rays on

<P>the jewelled hilt of his kriss protruding from under the many

<P>folds of the red sarong gathered into a sash round his waist, and

<P>played on the precious stones of the many rings on his dark

<P>fingers.&nbsp; He straightened himself up quickly after the low bow,

<P>putting his hand with a graceful ease on the hilt of his heavy

<P>short sword ornamented with brilliantly dyed fringes of

<P>horsehair.&nbsp; Nina, hesitating on the threshold, saw an erect lithe

<P>figure of medium height with a breadth of shoulder suggesting

<P>great power.&nbsp; Under the folds of a blue turban, whose fringed

<P>ends hung gracefully over the left shoulder, was a face full of

<P>determination and expressing a reckless good-humour, not devoid,

<P>however, of some dignity.&nbsp; The squareness of lower jaw, the full

<P>red lips, the mobile nostrils, and the proud carriage of the head

<P>gave the impression of a being half-savage, untamed, perhaps

<P>cruel, and corrected the liquid softness of the almost feminine

<P>eye, that general characteristic of the race.&nbsp; Now, the first

<P>surprise over, Nina saw those eyes fixed upon her with such an

<P>uncontrolled expression of admiration and desire that she felt a

<P>hitherto unknown feeling of shyness, mixed with alarm and some

<P>delight, enter and penetrate her whole being.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Confused by those unusual sensations she stopped in the doorway

<P>and instinctively drew the lower part of the curtain across her

<P>face, leaving only half a rounded cheek, a stray tress, and one

<P>eye exposed, wherewith to contemplate the gorgeous and bold being

<P>so unlike in appearance to the rare specimens of traders she had

<P>seen before on that same verandah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain Maroola, dazzled by the unexpected vision, forgot the

<P>confused Almayer, forgot his brig, his escort staring in

<P>open-mouthed admiration, the object of his visit and all things

<P>else, in his overpowering desire to prolong the contemplation of

<P>so much loveliness met so suddenly in such an unlikely place--as

<P>he thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is my daughter," said Almayer, in an embarrassed manner.&nbsp; "It

<P>is of no consequence.&nbsp; White women have their customs, as you

<P>know Tuan, having travelled much, as you say.&nbsp; However, it is

<P>late; we will finish our talk to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain bent low trying to convey in a last glance towards the girl

<P>the bold expression of his overwhelming admiration.&nbsp; The next

<P>minute he was shaking Almayer's hand with grave courtesy, his

<P>face wearing a look of stolid unconcern as to any feminine

<P>presence.&nbsp; His men filed off, and he followed them quickly,

<P>closely attended by a thick-set, savage-looking Sumatrese he had

<P>introduced before as the commander of his brig.&nbsp; Nina walked to

<P>the balustrade of the verandah and saw the sheen of moonlight on

<P>the steel spear-heads and heard the rhythmic jingle of brass

<P>anklets as the men moved in single file towards the jetty.&nbsp; The

<P>boat shoved off after a little while, looming large in the full

<P>light of the moon, a black shapeless mass in the slight haze

<P>hanging over the water.&nbsp; Nina fancied she could distinguish the

<P>graceful figure of the trader standing erect in the stern sheets,

<P>but in a little while all the outlines got blurred, confused, and

<P>soon disappeared in the folds of white vapour shrouding the

<P>middle of the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer had approached his daughter, and leaning with both arms

<P>over the rail, was looking moodily down on the heap of rubbish

<P>and broken bottles at the foot of the verandah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What was all that noise just now?" he growled peevishly, without

<P>looking up.&nbsp; "Confound you and your mother!&nbsp; What did she
want?

<P>What did you come out for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She did not want to let me come out," said Nina.&nbsp; "She is angry.

<P>She says the man just gone is some Rajah.&nbsp; I think she is right

<P>now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe all you women are crazy," snarled Almayer.&nbsp; "What's

<P>that to you, to her, to anybody?&nbsp; The man wants to collect

<P>trepang and birds' nests on the islands.&nbsp; He told me so, that

<P>Rajah of yours.&nbsp; He will come to-morrow.&nbsp; I want you both
to keep

<P>away from the house, and let me attend to my business in peace."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain Maroola came the next day and had a long conversation with

<P>Almayer.&nbsp; This was the beginning of a close and friendly

<P>intercourse which, at first, was much remarked in Sambir, till

<P>the population got used to the frequent sight of many fires

<P>burning in Almayer's campong, where Maroola's men were warming

<P>themselves during the cold nights of the north-east monsoon,

<P>while their master had long conferences with the Tuan Putih--as

<P>they styled Almayer amongst themselves.&nbsp; Great was the curiosity

<P>in Sambir on the subject of the new trader.&nbsp; Had he seen the

<P>Sultan?&nbsp; What did the Sultan say?&nbsp; Had he given any presents?

<P>What would he sell? What would he buy? Those were the questions

<P>broached eagerly by the inhabitants of bamboo houses built over

<P>the river.&nbsp; Even in more substantial buildings, in Abdulla's

<P>house, in the residences of principal traders, Arab, Chinese, and

<P>Bugis, the excitement ran high, and lasted many days.&nbsp; With

<P>inborn suspicion they would not believe the simple account of

<P>himself the young trader was always ready to give.&nbsp; Yet it had

<P>all the appearance of truth.&nbsp; He said he was a trader, and sold

<P>rice.&nbsp; He did not want to buy gutta-percha or beeswax, because
he

<P>intended to employ his numerous crew in collecting trepang on the

<P>coral reefs outside the river, and also in seeking for bird's

<P>nests on the mainland.&nbsp; Those two articles he professed himself

<P>ready to buy if there were any to be obtained in that way.&nbsp; He

<P>said he was from Bali, and a Brahmin, which last statement he

<P>made good by refusing all food during his often repeated visits

<P>to Lakamba's and Almayer's houses.&nbsp; To Lakamba he went generally

<P>at night and had long audiences.&nbsp; Babalatchi, who was always a

<P>third party at those meetings of potentate and trader, knew how

<P>to resist all attempts on the part of the curious to ascertain

<P>the subject of so many long talks.&nbsp; When questioned with languid

<P>courtesy by the grave Abdulla he sought refuge in a vacant stare

<P>of his one eye, and in the affectation of extreme simplicity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am only my master's slave," murmured Babalatchi, in a

<P>hesitating manner.&nbsp; Then as if making up his mind suddenly for
a

<P>reckless confidence he would inform Abdulla of some transaction

<P>in rice, repeating the words, "A hundred big bags the Sultan

<P>bought; a hundred, Tuan!" in a tone of mysterious solemnity.

<P>Abdulla, firmly persuaded of the existence of some more important

<P>dealings, received, however, the information with all the signs

<P>of respectful astonishment.&nbsp; And the two would separate, the Arab

<P>cursing inwardly the wily dog, while Babalatchi went on his way

<P>walking on the dusty path, his body swaying, his chin with its

<P>few grey hairs pushed forward, resembling an inquisitive goat

<P>bent on some unlawful expedition.&nbsp; Attentive eyes watched his

<P>movements.&nbsp; Jim-Eng, descrying Babalatchi far away, would shake

<P>off the stupor of an habitual opium smoker and, tottering on to

<P>the middle of the road, would await the approach of that

<P>important person, ready with hospitable invitation.&nbsp; But

<P>Babalatchi's discretion was proof even against the combined

<P>assaults of good fellowship and of strong gin generously

<P>administered by the open-hearted Chinaman.&nbsp; Jim-Eng, owning

<P>himself beaten, was left uninformed with the empty bottle, and

<P>gazed sadly after the departing form of the statesman of Sambir

<P>pursuing his devious and unsteady way, which, as usual, led him

<P>to Almayer's compound.&nbsp; Ever since a reconciliation had been

<P>effected by Dain Maroola between his white friend and the Rajah,

<P>the one-eyed diplomatist had again become a frequent guest in the

<P>Dutchman's house.&nbsp; To Almayer's great disgust he was to be seen

<P>there at all times, strolling about in an abstracted kind of way

<P>on the verandah, skulking in the passages, or else popping round

<P>unexpected corners, always willing to engage Mrs. Almayer in

<P>confidential conversation.&nbsp; He was very shy of the master

<P>himself, as if suspicious that the pent-up feelings of the white

<P>man towards his person might find vent in a sudden kick.&nbsp; But the

<P>cooking shed was his favourite place, and he became an habitual

<P>guest there, squatting for hours amongst the busy women, with his

<P>chin resting on his knees, his lean arms clasped round his legs,

<P>and his one eye roving uneasily--the very picture of watchful

<P>ugliness.&nbsp; Almayer wanted more than once to complain to Lakamba

<P>of his Prime Minister's intrusion, but Dain dissuaded him.&nbsp; "We

<P>cannot say a word here that he does not hear," growled Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then come and talk on board the brig," retorted Dain, with a

<P>quiet smile.&nbsp; "It is good to let the man come here.&nbsp; Lakamba

<P>thinks he knows much.&nbsp; Perhaps the Sultan thinks I want to run

<P>away.&nbsp; Better let the one-eyed crocodile sun himself in your

<P>campong, Tuan."
<BR>&nbsp;
