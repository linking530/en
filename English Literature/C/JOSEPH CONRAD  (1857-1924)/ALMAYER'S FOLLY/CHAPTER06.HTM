<P>Dain was not long in crossing the river after leaving Almayer.

<P>He landed at the water-gate of the stockade enclosing the group

<P>of houses which composed the residence of the Rajah of Sambir.

<P>Evidently somebody was expected there, for the gate was open, and

<P>men with torches were ready to precede the visitor up the

<P>inclined plane of planks leading to the largest house where

<P>Lakamba actually resided, and where all the business of state was

<P>invariably transacted.&nbsp; The other buildings within the enclosure

<P>served only to accommodate the numerous household and the wives

<P>of the ruler.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lakamba's own house was a strong structure of solid planks,

<P>raised on high piles, with a verandah of split bamboos

<P>surrounding it on all sides; the whole was covered in by an

<P>immensely high-pitched roof of palm-leaves, resting on beams

<P>blackened by the smoke of many torches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The building stood parallel to the river, one of its long sides

<P>facing the water-gate of the stockade.&nbsp; There was a door in the

<P>short side looking up the river, and the inclined plank-way led

<P>straight from the gate to that door.&nbsp; By the uncertain light of

<P>smoky torches, Dain noticed the vague outlines of a group of

<P>armed men in the dark shadows to his right.&nbsp; From that group

<P>Babalatchi stepped forward to open the door, and Dain entered the

<P>audience chamber of the Rajah's residence.&nbsp; About one-third of

<P>the house was curtained off, by heavy stuff of European

<P>manufacture, for that purpose; close to the curtain there was a

<P>big arm-chair of some black wood, much carved, and before it a

<P>rough deal table.&nbsp; Otherwise the room was only furnished with

<P>mats in great profusion.&nbsp; To the left of the entrance stood a

<P>rude arm-rack, with three rifles with fixed bayonets in it.&nbsp; By

<P>the wall, in the shadow, the body-guard of Lakamba--all friends

<P>or relations--slept in a confused heap of brown arms, legs, and

<P>multi-coloured garments, from whence issued an occasional snore

<P>or a subdued groan of some uneasy sleeper.&nbsp; An European lamp with

<P>a green shade standing on the table made all this indistinctly

<P>visible to Dain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are welcome to your rest here," said Babalatchi, looking at

<P>Dain interrogatively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must speak to the Rajah at once," answered Dain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi made a gesture of assent, and, turning to the brass

<P>gong suspended under the arm-rack, struck two sharp blows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ear-splitting din woke up the guard.&nbsp; The snores ceased;

<P>outstretched legs were drawn in; the whole heap moved, and slowly

<P>resolved itself into individual forms, with much yawning and

<P>rubbing of sleepy eyes; behind the curtains there was a burst of

<P>feminine chatter; then the bass voice of Lakamba was heard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is that the Arab trader?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, Tuan," answered Babalatchi; "Dain has returned at last.&nbsp; He

<P>is here for an important talk, bitcharra--if you mercifully

<P>consent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Evidently Lakamba's mercy went so far--for in a short while he

<P>came out from behind the curtain--but it did not go to the length

<P>of inducing him to make an extensive toilet.&nbsp; A short red sarong

<P>tightened hastily round his hips was his only garment.&nbsp; The

<P>merciful ruler of Sambir looked sleepy and rather sulky.&nbsp; He sat

<P>in the arm-chair, his knees well apart, his elbows on the

<P>arm-rests, his chin on his breast, breathing heavily and waiting

<P>malevolently for Dain to open the important talk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Dain did not seem anxious to begin.&nbsp; He directed his gaze

<P>towards Babalatchi, squatting comfortably at the feet of his

<P>master, and remained silent with a slightly bent head as if in

<P>attentive expectation of coming words of wisdom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi coughed discreetly, and, leaning forward, pushed over

<P>a few mats for Dain to sit upon, then lifting up his squeaky

<P>voice he assured him with eager volubility of everybody's delight

<P>at this long-looked-for return.&nbsp; His heart had hungered for the

<P>sight of Dain's face, and his ears were withering for the want of

<P>the refreshing sound of his voice.&nbsp; Everybody's hearts and ears

<P>were in the same sad predicament, according to Babalatchi, as he

<P>indicated with a sweeping gesture the other bank of the river

<P>where the settlement slumbered peacefully, unconscious of the

<P>great joy awaiting it on the morrow when Dain's presence amongst

<P>them would be disclosed.&nbsp; "For"--went on Babalatchi--"what is the

<P>joy of a poor man if not the open hand of a generous trader or of

<P>a great--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here he checked himself abruptly with a calculated embarrassment

<P>of manner, and his roving eye sought the floor, while an

<P>apologetic smile dwelt for a moment on his misshapen lips.&nbsp; Once

<P>or twice during this opening speech an amused expression flitted

<P>across Dain's face, soon to give way, however, to an appearance

<P>of grave concern.&nbsp; On Lakamba's brow a heavy frown had settled,

<P>and his lips moved angrily as he listened to his Prime Minister's

<P>oratory.&nbsp; In the silence that fell upon the room when Babalatchi

<P>ceased speaking arose a chorus of varied snores from the corner

<P>where the body-guard had resumed their interrupted slumbers, but

<P>the distant rumble of thunder filling then Nina's heart with

<P>apprehension for the safety of her lover passed unheeded by those

<P>three men intent each on their own purposes, for life or death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short silence, Babalatchi, discarding now the flowers of

<P>polite eloquence, spoke again, but in short and hurried sentences

<P>and in a low voice.&nbsp; They had been very uneasy.&nbsp; Why did Dain

<P>remain so long absent?&nbsp; The men dwelling on the lower reaches of

<P>the river heard the reports of big guns and saw a fire-ship of

<P>the Dutch amongst the islands of the estuary.&nbsp; So they were

<P>anxious.&nbsp; Rumours of a disaster had reached Abdulla a few days

<P>ago, and since then they had been waiting for Dain's return under

<P>the apprehension of some misfortune.&nbsp; For days they had closed

<P>their eyes in fear, and woke up alarmed, and walked abroad

<P>trembling, like men before an enemy.&nbsp; And all on account of Dain.

<P>Would he not allay their fears for his safety, not for

<P>themselves?&nbsp; They were quiet and faithful, and devoted to the

<P>great Rajah in Batavia--may his fate lead him ever to victory for

<P>the joy and profit of his servants!&nbsp; "And here," went on

<P>Babalatchi, "Lakamba my master was getting thin in his anxiety

<P>for the trader he had taken under his protection; and so was

<P>Abdulla, for what would wicked men not say if perchance - "
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Be silent, fool!" growled Lakamba, angrily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi subsided into silence with a satisfied smile, while

<P>Dain, who had been watching him as if fascinated, turned with a

<P>sigh of relief towards the ruler of Sambir.&nbsp; Lakamba did not

<P>move, and, without raising his head, looked at Dain from under

<P>his eyebrows, breathing audibly, with pouted lips, in an air of

<P>general discontent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Speak! O Dain!" he said at last.&nbsp; "We have heard many rumours.

<P>Many nights in succession has my friend Reshid come here with bad

<P>tidings.&nbsp; News travels fast along the coast.&nbsp; But they may
be

<P>untrue; there are more lies in men's mouths in these days than

<P>when I was young, but I am not easier to deceive now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All my words are true," said Dain, carelessly.&nbsp; "If you want to

<P>know what befell my brig, then learn that it is in the hands of

<P>the Dutch.&nbsp; Believe me, Rajah," he went on, with sudden energy,

<P>"the Orang Blanda have good friends in Sambir, or else how did

<P>they know I was coming thence?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lakamba gave Dain a short and hostile glance.&nbsp; Babalatchi rose

<P>quietly, and, going to the arm-rack, struck the gong violently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Outside the door there was a shuffle of bare feet; inside, the

<P>guard woke up and sat staring in sleepy surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you faithful friend of the white Rajah," went on Dain,

<P>scornfully, turning to Babalatchi, who had returned to his place,

<P>"I have escaped, and I am here to gladden your heart.&nbsp; When I saw

<P>the Dutch ship I ran the brig inside the reefs and put her

<P>ashore.&nbsp; They did not dare to follow with the ship, so they sent

<P>the boats.&nbsp; We took to ours and tried to get away, but the ship

<P>dropped fireballs at us, and killed many of my men.&nbsp; But I am

<P>left, O Babalatchi!&nbsp; The Dutch are coming here.&nbsp; They are
seeking

<P>for me.&nbsp; They are coming to ask their faithful friend Lakamba and

<P>his slave Babalatchi.&nbsp; Rejoice!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But neither of his hearers appeared to be in a joyful mood.

<P>Lakamba had put one leg over his knee, and went on gently

<P>scratching it with a meditative air, while Babalatchi, sitting

<P>cross-legged, seemed suddenly to become smaller and very limp,

<P>staring straight before him vacantly.&nbsp; The guard evinced some

<P>interest in the proceedings, stretching themselves full length on

<P>the mats to be nearer the speaker.&nbsp; One of them got up and now

<P>stood leaning against the arm-rack, playing absently with the

<P>fringes of his sword-hilt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain waited till the crash of thunder had died away in distant

<P>mutterings before he spoke again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you dumb, O ruler of Sambir, or is the son of a great Rajah

<P>unworthy of your notice?&nbsp; I am come here to seek refuge and to

<P>warn you, and want to know what you intend doing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You came here because of the white man's daughter," retorted

<P>Lakamba, quickly.&nbsp; "Your refuge was with your father, the Rajah

<P>of Bali, the Son of Heaven, the 'Anak Agong' himself.&nbsp; What am
I

<P>to protect great princes?&nbsp; Only yesterday I planted rice in a

<P>burnt clearing; to-day you say I hold your life in my hand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi glanced at his master.&nbsp; "No man can escape his fate,"

<P>he murmured piously.&nbsp; "When love enters a man's heart he is like

<P>a child--without any understanding.&nbsp; Be merciful, Lakamba," he

<P>added, twitching the corner of the Rajah's sarong warningly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lakamba snatched away the skirt of the sarong angrily.&nbsp; Under the

<P>dawning comprehension of intolerable embarrassments caused by

<P>Dain's return to Sambir he began to lose such composure as he had

<P>been, till then, able to maintain; and now he raised his voice

<P>loudly above the whistling of the wind and the patter of rain on

<P>the roof in the hard squall passing over the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You came here first as a trader with sweet words and great

<P>promises, asking me to look the other way while you worked your

<P>will on the white man there.&nbsp; And I did.&nbsp; What do you want
now?

<P>When I was young I fought.&nbsp; Now I am old, and want peace.&nbsp;
It is

<P>easier for me to have you killed than to fight the Dutch.&nbsp; It is

<P>better for me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The squall had now passed, and, in the short stillness of the

<P>lull in the storm, Lakamba repeated softly, as if to himself,

<P>"Much easier.&nbsp; Much better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain did not seem greatly discomposed by the Rajah's threatening

<P>words.&nbsp; While Lakamba was speaking he had glanced once rapidly

<P>over his shoulder, just to make sure that there was nobody behind

<P>him, and, tranquillised in that respect, he had extracted a

<P>siri-box out of the folds of his waist-cloth, and was wrapping

<P>carefully the little bit of betel-nut and a small pinch of lime

<P>in the green leaf tendered him politely by the watchful

<P>Babalatchi.&nbsp; He accepted this as a peace- offering from the

<P>silent statesman--a kind of mute protest against his master's

<P>undiplomatic violence, and as an omen of a possible understanding

<P>to be arrived at yet.&nbsp; Otherwise Dain was not uneasy.&nbsp; Although

<P>recognising the justice of Lakamba's surmise that he had come

<P>back to Sambir only for the sake of the white man's daughter, yet

<P>he was not conscious of any childish lack of understanding, as

<P>suggested by Babalatchi.&nbsp; In fact, Dain knew very well that

<P>Lakamba was too deeply implicated in the gunpowder smuggling to

<P>care for an investigation the Dutch authorities into that matter.

<P>When sent off by his father, the independent Rajah of Bali, at

<P>the time when the hostilities between Dutch and Malays threatened

<P>to spread from Sumatra over the whole archipelago, Dain had found

<P>all the big traders deaf to his guarded proposals, and above the

<P>temptation of the great prices he was ready to give for

<P>gunpowder.&nbsp; He went to Sambir as a last and almost hopeless

<P>resort, having heard in Macassar of the white man there, and of

<P>the regular steamer trading from Singapore--allured also by the

<P>fact that there was no Dutch resident on the river, which would

<P>make things easier, no doubt.&nbsp; His hopes got nearly wrecked
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>against the stubborn loyalty of Lakamba arising from

<P>well-understood self-interest; but at last the young man's

<P>generosity, his persuasive enthusiasm, the prestige of his

<P>father's great name, overpowered the prudent hesitation of the

<P>ruler of Sambir.&nbsp; Lakamba would have nothing to do himself with

<P>any illegal traffic.&nbsp; He also objected to the Arabs being made

<P>use of in that matter; but he suggested Almayer, saying that he

<P>was a weak man easily persuaded, and that his friend, the English

<P>captain of the steamer, could be made very useful--very likely

<P>even would join in the business, smuggling the powder in the

<P>steamer without Abdulla's knowledge.&nbsp; There again Dain met in

<P>Almayer with unexpected resistance; Lakamba had to send

<P>Babalatchi over with the solemn promise that his eyes would be

<P>shut in friendship for the white man, Dain paying for the promise

<P>and the friendship in good silver guilders of the hated Orang

<P>Blanda.&nbsp; Almayer, at last consenting, said the powder would be

<P>obtained, but Dain must trust him with dollars to send to

<P>Singapore in payment for it.&nbsp; He would induce Ford to buy and

<P>smuggle it in the steamer on board the brig.&nbsp; He did not want any

<P>money for himself out of the transaction, but Dain must help him

<P>in his great enterprise after sending off the brig.&nbsp; Almayer had

<P>explained to Dain that he could not trust Lakamba alone in that

<P>matter; he would be afraid of losing his treasure and his life

<P>through the cupidity of the Rajah; yet the Rajah had to be told,

<P>and insisted on taking a share in that operation, or else his

<P>eyes would remain shut no longer.&nbsp; To this Almayer had to submit.

<P>Had Dain not seen Nina he would have probably refused to engage

<P>himself and his men in the projected expedition to Gunong

<P>Mas--the mountain of gold.&nbsp; As it was he intended to return with

<P>half of his men as soon as the brig was clear of the reefs, but

<P>the persistent chase given him by the Dutch frigate had forced

<P>him to run south and ultimately to wreck and destroy his vessel

<P>in order to preserve his liberty or perhaps even his life.&nbsp; Yes,

<P>he had come back to Sambir for Nina, although aware that the

<P>Dutch would look for him there, but he had also calculated his

<P>chances of safety in Lakamba's hands.&nbsp; For all his ferocious

<P>talk, the merciful ruler would not kill him, for he had long ago

<P>been impressed with the notion that Dain possessed the secret of

<P>the white man's treasure; neither would he give him up to the

<P>Dutch, for fear of some fatal disclosure of complicity in the

<P>treasonable trade.&nbsp; So Dain felt tolerably secure as he sat

<P>meditating quietly his answer to the Rajah's bloodthirsty speech.

<P>Yes, he would point out to him the aspect of his position should

<P>he--Dain--fall into the hands of the Dutch and should he speak

<P>the truth.&nbsp; He would have nothing more to lose then, and he would

<P>speak the truth.&nbsp; And if he did return to Sambir, disturbing

<P>thereby Lakamba's peace of mind, what then?&nbsp; He came to look

<P>after his property.&nbsp; Did he not pour a stream of silver into Mrs.

<P>Almayer's greedy lap?&nbsp; He had paid, for the girl, a price worthy

<P>of a great prince, although unworthy of that delightfully

<P>maddening creature for whom his untamed soul longed in an

<P>intensity of desire far more tormenting than the sharpest pain.

<P>He wanted his happiness.&nbsp; He had the right to be in Sambir.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He rose, and, approaching the table, leaned both his elbows on

<P>it; Lakamba responsively edged his seat a little closer, while

<P>Babalatchi scrambled to his feet and thrust his inquisitive head

<P>between his master's and Dain's.&nbsp; They interchanged their ideas

<P>rapidly, speaking in whispers into each other's faces, very close

<P>now, Dain suggesting, Lakamba contradicting, Babalatchi

<P>conciliating and anxious in his vivid apprehension of coming

<P>difficulties.&nbsp; He spoke most, whispering earnestly, turning his

<P>head slowly from side to side so as to bring his solitary eye to

<P>bear upon each of his interlocutors in turn.&nbsp; Why should there
be

<P>strife? said he.&nbsp; Let Tuan Dain, whom he loved only less than his

<P>master, go trustfully into hiding.&nbsp; There were many places for

<P>that.&nbsp; Bulangi's house away in the clearing was best.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Bulangi was a safe man.&nbsp; In the network of crooked channels no

<P>white man could find his way.&nbsp; White men were strong, but very

<P>foolish.&nbsp; It was undesirable to fight them, but deception was

<P>easy.&nbsp; They were like silly women--they did not know the use of

<P>reason, and he was a match for any of them--went on Babalatchi,

<P>with all the confidence of deficient experience.&nbsp; Probably the

<P>Dutch would seek Almayer.&nbsp; Maybe they would take away their

<P>countryman if they were suspicious of him.&nbsp; That would be good.

<P>After the Dutch went away Lakamba and Dain would get the treasure

<P>without any trouble, and there would be one person less to share

<P>it.&nbsp; Did he not speak wisdom?&nbsp; Will Tuan Dain go to Bulangi's

<P>house till the danger is over, go at once?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain accepted this suggestion of going into hiding with a certain

<P>sense of conferring a favour upon Lakamba and the anxious

<P>statesman, but he met the proposal of going at once with a

<P>decided no, looking Babalatchi meaningly in the eye.&nbsp; The

<P>statesman sighed as a man accepting the inevitable would do, and

<P>pointed silently towards the other bank of the river.&nbsp; Dain bent

<P>his head slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I am going there," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Before the day comes?" asked Babalatchi.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am going there now," answered Dain, decisively.&nbsp; "The Orang

<P>Blanda will not be here before to-morrow night, perhaps, and I

<P>must tell Almayer of our arrangements."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, Tuan.&nbsp; No; say nothing," protested Babalatchi.&nbsp; "I will
go

<P>over myself at sunrise and let him know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will see," said Dain, preparing to go.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The thunderstorm was recommencing outside, the heavy clouds

<P>hanging low overhead now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a constant rumble of distant thunder punctuated by the

<P>nearer sharp crashes, and in the continuous play of blue

<P>lightning the woods and the river showed fitfully, with all the

<P>elusive distinctness of detail characteristic of such a scene.

<P>Outside the door of the Rajah's house Dain and Babalatchi stood

<P>on the shaking verandah as if dazed and stunned by the violence

<P>of the storm.&nbsp; They stood there amongst the cowering forms of the

<P>Rajah's slaves and retainers seeking shelter from the rain, and

<P>Dain called aloud to his boatmen, who responded with an unanimous

<P>"Ada! Tuan!" while they looked uneasily at the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is a great flood!" shouted Babalatchi into Dain's ear.

<P>"The river is very angry.&nbsp; Look! Look at the drifting logs! Can

<P>you go?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain glanced doubtfully on the livid expanse of seething water

<P>bounded far away on the other side by the narrow black line of

<P>the forests.&nbsp; Suddenly, in a vivid white flash, the low point of

<P>land with the bending trees on it and Almayer's house, leaped

<P>into view, flickered and disappeared.&nbsp; Dain pushed Babalatchi

<P>aside and ran down to the water-gate followed by his shivering

<P>boatmen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi backed slowly in and closed the door, then turned

<P>round and looked silently upon Lakamba.&nbsp; The Rajah sat still,

<P>glaring stonily upon the table, and Babalatchi gazed curiously at

<P>the perplexed mood of the man he had served so many years through

<P>good and evil fortune.&nbsp; No doubt the one-eyed statesman felt

<P>within his savage and much sophisticated breast the unwonted

<P>feelings of sympathy with, and perhaps even pity for, the man he

<P>called his master.&nbsp; From the safe position of a confidential

<P>adviser, he could, in the dim vista of past years, see himself--a

<P>casual cut-throat--finding shelter under that man's roof in the

<P>modest rice-clearing of early beginnings.&nbsp; Then came a long

<P>period of unbroken success, of wise counsels, and deep plottings

<P>resolutely carried out by the fearless Lakamba, till the whole

<P>east coast from Poulo Laut to Tanjong Batu listened to

<P>Babalatchi's wisdom speaking through the mouth of the ruler of

<P>Sambir.&nbsp; In those long years how many dangers escaped, how many

<P>enemies bravely faced, how many white men successfully

<P>circumvented!&nbsp; And now he looked upon the result of so many years

<P>of patient toil:&nbsp; the fearless Lakamba cowed by the shadow of an

<P>impending trouble.&nbsp; The ruler was growing old, and Babalatchi,

<P>aware of an uneasy feeling at the pit of his stomach, put both

<P>his hands there with a suddenly vivid and sad perception of the

<P>fact that he himself was growing old too; that the time of

<P>reckless daring was past for both of them, and that they had to

<P>seek refuge in prudent cunning.&nbsp; They wanted peace; they were

<P>disposed to reform; they were ready even to retrench, so as to

<P>have the wherewithal to bribe the evil days away, if bribed away

<P>they could be.&nbsp; Babalatchi sighed for the second time that night

<P>as he squatted again at his master's feet and tendered him his

<P>betel-nut box in mute sympathy.&nbsp; And they sat there in close yet

<P>silent communion of betel-nut chewers, moving their jaws slowly,

<P>expectorating decorously into the wide-mouthed brass vessel they

<P>passed to one another, and listening to the awful din of the

<P>battling elements outside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is a very great flood," remarked Babalatchi, sadly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Lakamba.&nbsp; "Did Dain go?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He went, Tuan.&nbsp; He ran down to the river like a man possessed
of

<P>the Sheitan himself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was another long pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He may get drowned," suggested Lakamba at last, with some show

<P>of interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The floating logs are many," answered Babalatchi, "but he is a

<P>good swimmer," he added languidly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He ought to live," said Lakamba; "he knows where the treasure

<P>is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi assented with an ill-humoured grunt.&nbsp; His want of

<P>success in penetrating the white man's secret as to the locality

<P>where the gold was to be found was a sore point with the

<P>statesman of Sambir, as the only conspicuous failure in an

<P>otherwise brilliant career.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A great peace had now succeeded the turmoil of the storm.&nbsp; Only

<P>the little belated clouds, which hurried past overhead to catch

<P>up the main body flashing silently in the distance, sent down

<P>short showers that pattered softly with a soothing hiss over the

<P>palm-leaf roof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lakamba roused himself from his apathy with an appearance of

<P>having grasped the situation at last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Babalatchi," he called briskly, giving him a slight kick.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ada Tuan! I am listening."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If the Orang Blanda come here, Babalatchi, and take Almayer to

<P>Batavia to punish him for smuggling gunpowder, what will he do,

<P>you think?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know, Tuan."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are a fool," commented Lakamba, exultingly.&nbsp; "He will tell

<P>them where the treasure is, so as to find mercy.&nbsp; He will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi looked up at his master and nodded his head with by no

<P>means a joyful surprise.&nbsp; He had not thought of this; there was
a

<P>new complication.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Almayer must die," said Lakamba, decisively, "to make our secret

<P>safe.&nbsp; He must die quietly, Babalatchi.&nbsp; You must do it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi assented, and rose wearily to his feet.&nbsp; "To-morrow?"

<P>he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; before the Dutch come.&nbsp; He drinks much coffee," answered

<P>Lakamba, with seeming irrelevancy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi stretched himself yawning, but Lakamba, in the

<P>flattering consciousness of a knotty problem solved by his own

<P>unaided intellectual efforts, grew suddenly very wakeful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Babalatchi," he said to the exhausted statesman, "fetch the box

<P>of music the white captain gave me.&nbsp; I cannot sleep."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this order a deep shade of melancholy settled upon

<P>Babalatchi's features.&nbsp; He went reluctantly behind the curtain

<P>and soon reappeared carrying in his arms a small hand-organ,

<P>which he put down on the table with an air of deep dejection.

<P>Lakamba settled himself comfortably in his arm-chair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Turn, Babalatchi, turn," he murmured, with closed eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi's hand grasped the handle with the energy of despair,

<P>and as he turned, the deep gloom on his countenance changed into

<P>an expression of hopeless resignation.&nbsp; Through the open shutter

<P>the notes of Verdi's music floated out on the great silence over

<P>the river and forest.&nbsp; Lakamba listened with closed eyes and a

<P>delighted smile; Babalatchi turned, at times dozing off and

<P>swaying over, then catching himself up in a great fright with a

<P>few quick turns of the handle.&nbsp; Nature slept in an exhausted

<P>repose after the fierce turmoil, while under the unsteady hand of

<P>the statesman of Sambir the Trovatore fitfully wept, wailed, and

<P>bade good-bye to his Leonore again and again in a mournful round

<P>of tearful and endless iteration.
