<P>"Can I believe what you tell me? It is like a tale for men that

<P>listen only half awake by the camp fire, and it seems to have run

<P>off a woman's tongue."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who is there here for me to deceive, O Rajah?" answered

<P>Babalatchi.&nbsp; "Without you I am nothing.&nbsp; All I have told you
I

<P>believe to be true.&nbsp; I have been safe for many years in the

<P>hollow of your hand.&nbsp; This is no time to harbour suspicions.&nbsp;
The

<P>danger is very great.&nbsp; We should advise and act at once, before

<P>the sun sets."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Right.&nbsp; Right," muttered Lakamba, pensively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had been sitting for the last hour together in the audience

<P>chamber of the Rajah's house, for Babalatchi, as soon as he had

<P>witnessed the landing of the Dutch officers, had crossed the

<P>river to report to his master the events of the morning, and to

<P>confer with him upon the line of conduct to pursue in the face of

<P>altered circumstances.&nbsp; They were both puzzled and frightened by

<P>the unexpected turn the events had taken.&nbsp; The Rajah, sitting

<P>crosslegged on his chair, looked fixedly at the floor; Babalatchi

<P>was squatting close by in an attitude of deep dejection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And where did you say he is hiding now?" asked Lakamba, breaking

<P>at last the silence full of gloomy forebodings in which they both

<P>had been lost for a long while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In Bulangi's clearing--the furthest one, away from the house.

<P>They went there that very night.&nbsp; The white man's daughter took

<P>him there.&nbsp; She told me so herself, speaking to me openly, for

<P>she is half white and has no decency.&nbsp; She said she was waiting

<P>for him while he was here; then, after a long time, he came out

<P>of the darkness and fell at her feet exhausted.&nbsp; He lay like one

<P>dead, but she brought him back to life in her arms, and made him

<P>breathe again with her own breath.&nbsp; That is what she said,

<P>speaking to my face, as I am speaking now to you, Rajah.&nbsp; She is

<P>like a white woman and knows no shame."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused, deeply shocked.&nbsp; Lakamba nodded his head.&nbsp; "Well,
and

<P>then?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They called the old woman," went on Babalatchi, "and he told

<P>them all--about the brig, and how he tried to kill many men.&nbsp; He

<P>knew the Orang Blanda were very near, although he had said

<P>nothing to us about that; he knew his great danger.&nbsp; He thought

<P>he had killed many, but there were only two dead, as I have heard

<P>from the men of the sea that came in the warship's boats."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And the other man, he that was found in the river?" interrupted

<P>Lakamba.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That was one of his boatmen.&nbsp; When his canoe was overturned by

<P>the logs those two swam together, but the other man must have

<P>been hurt.&nbsp; Dain swam, holding him up.&nbsp; He left him in the
bushes

<P>when he went up to the house.&nbsp; When they all came down his heart

<P>had ceased to beat; then the old woman spoke; Dain thought it was

<P>good.&nbsp; He took off his anklet and broke it, twisting it round the

<P>man's foot.&nbsp; His ring he put on that slave's hand.&nbsp; He took
off

<P>his sarong and clothed that thing that wanted no clothes, the two

<P>women holding it up meanwhile, their intent being to deceive all

<P>eyes and to mislead the minds in the settlement, so that they

<P>could swear to the thing that was not, and that there could be no

<P>treachery when the white-men came.&nbsp; Then Dain and the white woman

<P>departed to call up Bulangi and find a hiding-place.&nbsp; The old

<P>woman remained by the body."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hai!" exclaimed Lakamba.&nbsp; "She has wisdom."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she has a Devil of her own to whisper counsel in her ear,"

<P>assented Babalatchi.&nbsp; "She dragged the body with great toil to

<P>the point where many logs were stranded.&nbsp; All these things were

<P>done in the darkness after the storm had passed away.&nbsp; Then she

<P>waited.&nbsp; At the first sign of daylight she battered the face of

<P>the dead with a heavy stone, and she pushed him amongst the logs.

<P>She remained near, watching.&nbsp; At sunrise Mahmat Banjer came and

<P>found him.&nbsp; They all believed; I myself was deceived, but not for

<P>long.&nbsp; The white man believed, and, grieving, fled to his house.

<P>When we were alone I, having doubts, spoke to the woman, and she,

<P>fearing my anger and your might, told me all, asking for help in

<P>saving Dain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He must not fall into the hands of the Orang Blanda," said

<P>Lakamba; "but let him die, if the thing can be done quietly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It cannot, Tuan!&nbsp; Remember there is that woman who, being half

<P>white, is ungovernable, and would raise a great outcry.&nbsp; Also the

<P>officers are here.&nbsp; They are angry enough already.&nbsp; Dain must

<P>escape; he must go.&nbsp; We must help him now for our own safety."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are the officers very angry?" inquired Lakamba, with interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are.&nbsp; The principal chief used strong words when speaking

<P>to me--to me when I salaamed in your name.&nbsp; I do not think,"

<P>added Babalatchi, after a short pause and looking very

<P>worried--"I do not think I saw a white chief so angry before.&nbsp;
He

<P>said we were careless or even worse.&nbsp; He told me he would speak

<P>to the Rajah, and that I was of no account."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Speak to the Rajah!" repeated Lakamba, thoughtfully.&nbsp; "Listen,

<P>Babalatchi: I am sick, and shall withdraw; you cross over and

<P>tell the white men."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Babalatchi, "I am going over at once; and as to

<P>Dain?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You get him away as you can best.&nbsp; This is a great trouble in
my

<P>heart," sighed Lakamba.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi got up, and, going close to his master, spoke

<P>earnestly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is one of our praus at the southern mouth of the river.

<P>The Dutch warship is to the northward watching the main entrance.

<P>I shall send Dain off to-night in a canoe, by the hidden

<P>channels, on board the prau.&nbsp; His father is a great prince, and

<P>shall hear of our generosity.&nbsp; Let the prau take him to Ampanam.

<P>Your glory shall be great, and your reward in powerful

<P>friendship.&nbsp; Almayer will no doubt deliver the dead body as

<P>Dain's to the officers, and the foolish white men shall say,

<P>'This is very good; let there be peace.' And the trouble shall be

<P>removed from your heart, Rajah."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True! true!" said Lakamba.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And, this being accomplished by me who am your slave, you shall

<P>reward with a generous hand.&nbsp; That I know!&nbsp; The white man
is

<P>grieving for the lost treasure, in the manner of white men who

<P>thirst after dollars.&nbsp; Now, when all other things are in order,

<P>we shall perhaps obtain the treasure from the white man.&nbsp; Dain

<P>must escape, and Almayer must live."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now go, Babalatchi, go!" said Lakamba, getting off his chair.

<P>"I am very sick, and want medicine.&nbsp; Tell the white chief so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Babalatchi was not to be got rid of in this summary manner.

<P>He knew that his master, after the manner of the great, liked to

<P>shift the burden of toil and danger on to his servants'

<P>shoulders, but in the difficult straits in which they were now

<P>the Rajah must play his part.&nbsp; He may be very sick for the white

<P>men, for all the world if he liked, as long as he would take upon

<P>himself the execution of part at least of Babalatchi's carefully

<P>thought-of plan.&nbsp; Babalatchi wanted a big canoe manned by twelve

<P>men to be sent out after dark towards Bulangi's clearing.&nbsp; Dain

<P>may have to be overpowered.&nbsp; A man in love cannot be expected to

<P>see clearly the path of safety if it leads him away from the

<P>object of his affections, argued Babalatchi, and in that case

<P>they would have to use force in order to make him go.&nbsp; Would the

<P>Rajah see that trusty men manned the canoe?&nbsp; The thing must be

<P>done secretly.&nbsp; Perhaps the Rajah would come himself, so as to

<P>bring all the weight of his authority to bear upon Dain if he

<P>should prove obstinate and refuse to leave his hiding-place.&nbsp; The

<P>Rajah would not commit himself to a definite promise, and

<P>anxiously pressed Babalatchi to go, being afraid of the white men

<P>paying him an unexpected visit.&nbsp; The aged statesman reluctantly

<P>took his leave and went into the courtyard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before going down to his boat Babalatchi stopped for a while in

<P>the big open space where the thick-leaved trees put black patches

<P>of shadow which seemed to float on a flood of smooth, intense

<P>light that rolled up to the houses and down to the stockade and

<P>over the river, where it broke and sparkled in thousands of

<P>glittering wavelets, like a band woven of azure and gold edged

<P>with the brilliant green of the forests guarding both banks of

<P>the Pantai.&nbsp; In the perfect calm before the coming of the

<P>afternoon breeze the irregularly jagged line of tree-tops stood

<P>unchanging, as if traced by an unsteady hand on the clear blue of

<P>the hot sky.&nbsp; In the space sheltered by the high palisades there

<P>lingered the smell of decaying blossoms from the surrounding

<P>forest, a taint of drying fish; with now and then a whiff of

<P>acrid smoke from the cooking fires when it eddied down from under

<P>the leafy boughs and clung lazily about the burnt-up grass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Babalatchi looked up at the flagstaff over-topping a group of

<P>low trees in the middle of the courtyard, the tricolour flag of

<P>the Netherlands stirred slightly for the first time since it had

<P>been hoisted that morning on the arrival of the man-of-war boats.

<P>With a faint rustle of trees the breeze came down in light puffs,

<P>playing capriciously for a time with this emblem of Lakamba's

<P>power, that was also the mark of his servitude; then the breeze

<P>freshened in a sharp gust of wind, and the flag flew out straight

<P>and steady above the trees.&nbsp; A dark shadow ran along the river,

<P>rolling over and covering up the sparkle of declining sunlight.

<P>A big white cloud sailed slowly across the darkening sky, and

<P>hung to the westward as if waiting for the sun to join it there.

<P>Men and things shook off the torpor of the hot afternoon and

<P>stirred into life under the first breath of the sea breeze.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi hurried down to the water-gate; yet before he passed

<P>through it he paused to look round the courtyard, with its light

<P>and shade, with its cheery fires, with the groups of Lakamba's

<P>soldiers and retainers scattered about.&nbsp; His own house stood

<P>amongst the other buildings in that enclosure, and the statesman

<P>of Sambir asked himself with a sinking heart when and how would

<P>it be given him to return to that house.&nbsp; He had to deal with a

<P>man more dangerous than any wild beast of his experience: a proud

<P>man, a man wilful after the manner of princes, a man in love.

<P>And he was going forth to speak to that man words of cold and

<P>worldly wisdom.&nbsp; Could anything be more appalling?&nbsp; What if
that

<P>man should take umbrage at some fancied slight to his honour or

<P>disregard of his affections and suddenly "amok"?&nbsp; The wise

<P>adviser would be the first victim, no doubt, and death would be

<P>his reward.&nbsp; And underlying the horror of this situation there

<P>was the danger of those meddlesome fools, the white men.&nbsp; A

<P>vision of comfortless exile in far-off Madura rose up before

<P>Babalatchi.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be worse than death itself?&nbsp; And
there

<P>was that half-white woman with threatening eyes.&nbsp; How could he

<P>tell what an incomprehensible creature of that sort would or

<P>would not do?&nbsp; She knew so much that she made the killing of Dain

<P>an impossibility.&nbsp; That much was certain.&nbsp; And yet the sharp,

<P>rough-edged kriss is a good and discreet friend, thought

<P>Babalatchi, as he examined his own lovingly, and put it back in

<P>the sheath, with a sigh of regret, before unfastening his canoe.

<P>As he cast off the painter, pushed out into the stream, and took

<P>up his paddle, he realised vividly how unsatisfactory it was to

<P>have women mixed up in state affairs.&nbsp; Young women, of course.

<P>For Mrs. Almayer's mature wisdom, and for the easy aptitude in

<P>intrigue that comes with years to the feminine mind, he felt the

<P>most sincere respect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paddled leisurely, letting the canoe drift down as he crossed

<P>towards the point.&nbsp; The sun was high yet, and nothing pressed.

<P>His work would commence only with the coming of darkness.

<P>Avoiding the Lingard jetty, he rounded the point, and paddled up

<P>the creek at the back of Almayer's house.&nbsp; There were many canoes

<P>lying there, their noses all drawn together, fastened all to the

<P>same stake.&nbsp; Babalatchi pushed his little craft in amongst them

<P>and stepped on shore.&nbsp; On the other side of the ditch something

<P>moved in the grass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who's that hiding?" hailed Babalatchi.&nbsp; "Come out and speak to

<P>me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nobody answered.&nbsp; Babalatchi crossed over, passing from boat to

<P>boat, and poked his staff viciously in the suspicious place.

<P>Taminah jumped up with a cry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you doing here?" he asked, surprised.&nbsp; "I have nearly

<P>stepped on your tray.&nbsp; Am I a Dyak that you should hide at my

<P>sight?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was weary, and--I slept," whispered Taminah, confusedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You slept! You have not sold anything to-day, and you will be

<P>beaten when you return home," said Babalatchi.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Taminah stood before him abashed and silent.&nbsp; Babalatchi looked

<P>her over carefully with great satisfaction.&nbsp; Decidedly he would

<P>offer fifty dollars more to that thief Bulangi.&nbsp; The girl pleased

<P>him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now you go home.&nbsp; It is late," he said sharply.&nbsp; "Tell Bulangi

<P>that I shall be near his house before the night is half over, and

<P>that I want him to make all things ready for a long journey.&nbsp; You

<P>understand?&nbsp; A long journey to the southward.&nbsp; Tell him that

<P>before sunset, and do not forget my words."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Taminah made a gesture of assent, and watched Babalatchi recross

<P>the ditch and disappear through the bushes bordering Almayer's

<P>compound.&nbsp; She moved a little further off the creek and sank in

<P>the grass again, lying down on her face, shivering in dry-eyed

<P>misery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi walked straight towards the cooking-shed looking for

<P>Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; The courtyard was in a great uproar.&nbsp; A strange

<P>Chinaman had possession of the kitchen fire and was noisily

<P>demanding another saucepan.&nbsp; He hurled objurgations, in the

<P>Canton dialect and bad Malay, against the group of slave-girls

<P>standing a little way off, half frightened, half amused, at his

<P>violence.&nbsp; From the camping fires round which the seamen of the

<P>frigate were sitting came words of encouragement, mingled with

<P>laughter and jeering.&nbsp; In the midst of this noise and confusion

<P>Babalatchi met Ali, an empty dish in his hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where are the white men?" asked Babalatchi.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They are eating in the front verandah," answered Ali.&nbsp; "Do not

<P>stop me, Tuan.&nbsp; I am giving the white men their food and am

<P>busy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where's Mem Almayer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Inside in the passage.&nbsp; She is listening to the talk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ali grinned and passed on; Babalatchi ascended the plankway to

<P>the rear verandah, and beckoning out Mrs. Almayer, engaged her in

<P>earnest conversation.&nbsp; Through the long passage, closed at the

<P>further end by the red curtain, they could hear from time to time

<P>Almayer's voice mingling in conversation with an abrupt loudness

<P>that made Mrs. Almayer look significantly at Babalatchi.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Listen," she said.&nbsp; "He has drunk much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He has," whispered Babalatchi.&nbsp; "He will sleep heavily

<P>to-night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Almayer looked doubtful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sometimes the devil of strong gin makes him keep awake, and he

<P>walks up and down the verandah all night, cursing; then we stand

<P>afar off," explained Mrs. Almayer, with the fuller knowledge born

<P>of twenty odd years of married life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But then he does not hear, nor understand, and his hand, of

<P>course, has no strength.&nbsp; We do not want him to hear to-night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," assented Mrs. Almayer, energetically, but in a cautiously

<P>subdued voice.&nbsp; "If he hears he will kill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi looked incredulous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hai Tuan, you may believe me.&nbsp; Have I not lived many years with

<P>that man?&nbsp; Have I not seen death in that man's eyes more than

<P>once when I was younger and he guessed at many things.&nbsp; Had he

<P>been a man of my own people I would not have seen such a look

<P>twice; but he--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a contemptuous gesture she seemed to fling unutterable scorn

<P>on Almayer's weak-minded aversion to sudden bloodshed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If he has the wish but not the strength, then what do we fear?"

<P>asked Babalatchi, after a short silence during which they both

<P>listened to Almayer's loud talk till it subsided into the murmur

<P>of general conversation.&nbsp; "What do we fear?" repeated Babalatchi

<P>again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To keep the daughter whom he loves he would strike into your

<P>heart and mine without hesitation," said Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; "When the

<P>girl is gone he will be like the devil unchained.&nbsp; Then you and
I

<P>had better beware."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am an old man and fear not death," answered Babalatchi, with a

<P>mendacious assumption of indifference.&nbsp; "But what will you do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am an old woman, and wish to live," retorted Mrs. Almayer.

<P>"She is my daughter also.&nbsp; I shall seek safety at the feet of our

<P>Rajah, speaking in the name of the past when we both were young,

<P>and he--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi raised his hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Enough.&nbsp; You shall be protected," he said soothingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again the sound of Almayer's voice was heard, and again

<P>interrupting their talk, they listened to the confused but loud

<P>utterance coming in bursts of unequal strength, with unexpected

<P>pauses and noisy repetitions that made some words and sentences

<P>fall clear and distinct on their ears out of the meaningless

<P>jumble of excited shoutings emphasised by the thumping of

<P>Almayer's fist upon the table.&nbsp; On the short intervals of

<P>silence, the high complaining note of tumblers, standing close

<P>together and vibrating to the shock, lingered, growing fainter,

<P>till it leapt up again into tumultuous ringing, when a new idea

<P>started a new rush of words and brought down the heavy hand

<P>again.&nbsp; At last the quarrelsome shouting ceased, and the thin

<P>plaint of disturbed glass died away into reluctant quietude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi and Mrs. Almayer had listened curiously, their bodies

<P>bent and their ears turned towards the passage.&nbsp; At every louder

<P>shout they nodded at each other with a ridiculous affectation of

<P>scandalised propriety, and they remained in the same attitude for

<P>some time after the noise had ceased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is the devil of gin," whispered Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; "Yes; he

<P>talks like that sometimes when there is nobody to hear him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What does he say?" inquired Babalatchi, eagerly.&nbsp; "You ought to

<P>understand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have forgotten their talk.&nbsp; A little I understood.&nbsp; He
spoke

<P>without any respect of the white ruler in Batavia, and of

<P>protection, and said he had been wronged; he said that several

<P>times.&nbsp; More I did not understand.&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp; Again he
speaks!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tse! tse! tse!" clicked Babalatchi, trying to appear shocked,

<P>but with a joyous twinkle of his solitary eye.&nbsp; "There will be

<P>great trouble between those white men.&nbsp; I will go round now and

<P>see.&nbsp; You tell your daughter that there is a sudden and a long

<P>journey before her, with much glory and splendour at the end.

<P>And tell her that Dain must go, or he must die, and that he will

<P>not go alone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, he will not go alone," slowly repeated Mrs. Almayer, with a

<P>thoughtful air, as she crept into the passage after seeing

<P>Babalatchi disappear round the corner of the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The statesman of Sambir, under the impulse of vivid curiosity,

<P>made his way quickly to the front of the house, but once there he

<P>moved slowly and cautiously as he crept step by step up the

<P>stairs of the verandah.&nbsp; On the highest step he sat down quietly,

<P>his feet on the steps below, ready for flight should his presence

<P>prove unwelcome.&nbsp; He felt pretty safe so.&nbsp; The table stood
nearly

<P>endways to him, and he saw Almayer's back; at Nina he looked full

<P>face, and had a side view of both officers; but of the four

<P>persons sitting at the table only Nina and the younger officer

<P>noticed his noiseless arrival.&nbsp; The momentary dropping of Nina's

<P>eyelids acknowledged Babalatchi's presence; she then spoke at

<P>once to the young sub, who turned towards her with attentive

<P>alacrity, but her gaze was fastened steadily on her father's face

<P>while Almayer was speaking uproariously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>" . . . disloyalty and unscrupulousness!&nbsp; What have you ever done

<P>to make me loyal?&nbsp; You have no grip on this country.&nbsp; I had
to

<P>take care of myself, and when I asked for protection I was met

<P>with threats and contempt, and had Arab slander thrown in my

<P>face.&nbsp; I! a white man!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be violent, Almayer," remonstrated the lieutenant; "I have

<P>heard all this already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then why do you talk to me about scruples?&nbsp; I wanted money, and

<P>I gave powder in exchange.&nbsp; How could I know that some of your

<P>wretched men were going to be blown up?&nbsp; Scruples!&nbsp; Pah!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He groped unsteadily amongst the bottles, trying one after

<P>another, grumbling to himself the while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No more wine," he muttered discontentedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have had enough, Almayer," said the lieutenant, as he

<P>lighted a cigar.&nbsp; "Is it not time to deliver to us your prisoner?

<P>I take it you have that Dain Maroola stowed away safely

<P>somewhere.&nbsp; Still we had better get that business over, and then

<P>we shall have more drink.&nbsp; Come! don't look at me like this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer was staring with stony eyes, his trembling fingers

<P>fumbling about his throat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gold," he said with difficulty.&nbsp; "Hem!&nbsp; A hand on the windpipe,

<P>you know.&nbsp; Sure you will excuse.&nbsp; I wanted to say--a little
gold

<P>for a little powder.&nbsp; What's that?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know, I know," said the lieutenant soothingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No! You don't know.&nbsp; Not one of you knows!" shouted Almayer.

<P>"The government is a fool, I tell you.&nbsp; Heaps of gold.&nbsp; I
am the

<P>man that knows; I and another one.&nbsp; But he won't speak.&nbsp; He
is--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He checked himself with a feeble smile, and, making an

<P>unsuccessful attempt to pat the officer on the shoulder, knocked

<P>over a couple of empty bottles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Personally you are a fine fellow," he said very distinctly, in a

<P>patronising manner.&nbsp; His head nodded drowsily as he sat muttering

<P>to himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two officers looked at each other helplessly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This won't do," said the lieutenant, addressing his junior.

<P>"Have the men mustered in the compound here.&nbsp; I must get some

<P>sense out of him.&nbsp; Hi!&nbsp; Almayer! Wake up, man.&nbsp; Redeem
your word.

<P>You gave your word.&nbsp; You gave your word of honour, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer shook off the officer's hand with impatience, but his

<P>ill-humour vanished at once, and he looked up, putting his

<P>forefinger to the side of his nose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very young; there is time for all things," he said, with

<P>an air of great sagacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant turned towards Nina, who, leaning back in her

<P>chair, watched her father steadily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Really I am very much distressed by all this for your sake," he

<P>exclaimed.&nbsp; "I do not know;" he went on, speaking with some

<P>embarrassment, "whether I have any right to ask you anything,

<P>unless, perhaps, to withdraw from this painful scene, but I feel

<P>that I must--for your father's good--suggest that you should--I

<P>mean if you have any influence over him you ought to exert it now

<P>to make him keep the promise he gave me before he--before he got

<P>into this state."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He observed with discouragement that she seemed not to take any

<P>notice of what he said sitting still with half-closed eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I trust--" he began again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is the promise you speak of?" abruptly asked Nina, leaving

<P>her seat and moving towards her father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing that is not just and proper.&nbsp; He promised to deliver to

<P>us a man who in time of profound peace took the lives of innocent

<P>men to escape the punishment he deserved for breaking the law.

<P>He planned his mischief on a large scale.&nbsp; It is not his fault
if

<P>it failed, partially.&nbsp; Of course you have heard of Dain Maroola.

<P>Your father secured him, I understand.&nbsp; We know he escaped up

<P>this river.&nbsp; Perhaps you--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And he killed white men!" interrupted Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I regret to say they were white.&nbsp; Yes, two white men lost their

<P>lives through that scoundrel's freak."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Two only!" exclaimed Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The officer looked at her in amazement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why! why! You- " he stammered, confused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There might have been more," interrupted Nina.&nbsp; "And when you

<P>get this--this scoundrel will you go?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant, still speechless, bowed his assent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then I would get him for you if I had to seek him in a burning

<P>fire," she burst out with intense energy.&nbsp; "I hate the sight of

<P>your white faces.&nbsp; I hate the sound of your gentle voices.&nbsp;
That

<P>is the way you speak to women, dropping sweet words before any

<P>pretty face.&nbsp; I have heard your voices before.&nbsp; I hoped to
live

<P>here without seeing any other white face but this," she added in

<P>a gentler tone, touching lightly her father's cheek.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer ceased his mumbling and opened his eyes.&nbsp; He caught hold

<P>of his daughter's hand and pressed it to his face, while Nina

<P>with the other hand smoothed his rumpled grey hair, looking

<P>defiantly over her father's head at the officer, who had now

<P>regained his composure and returned her look with a cool, steady

<P>stare.&nbsp; Below, in front of the verandah, they could hear the

<P>tramp of seamen mustering there according to orders.&nbsp; The

<P>sub-lieutenant came up the steps, while Babalatchi stood up

<P>uneasily and, with finger on lip, tried to catch Nina's eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are a good girl," whispered Almayer, absently, dropping his

<P>daughter's hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Father! father!" she cried, bending over him with passionate

<P>entreaty.&nbsp; "See those two men looking at us.&nbsp; Send them away.&nbsp;
I

<P>cannot bear it any more.&nbsp; Send them away.&nbsp; Do what they want
and

<P>let them go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She caught sight of Babalatchi and ceased speaking suddenly, but

<P>her foot tapped the floor with rapid beats in a paroxysm of

<P>nervous restlessness.&nbsp; The two officers stood close together

<P>looking on curiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What has happened?&nbsp; What is the matter?" whispered the younger

<P>man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't know," answered the other, under his breath.&nbsp; "One is

<P>furious, and the other is drunk.&nbsp; Not so drunk, either.&nbsp; Queer,

<P>this.&nbsp; Look!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer had risen, holding on to his daughter's arm.&nbsp; He

<P>hesitated a moment, then he let go his hold and lurched half-way

<P>across the verandah.&nbsp; There he pulled himself together, and stood

<P>very straight, breathing hard and glaring round angrily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are the men ready?" asked the lieutenant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All ready, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Mr. Almayer, lead the way," said the lieutenant
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer rested his eyes on him as if he saw him for the first

<P>time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Two men," he said thickly.&nbsp; The effort of speaking seemed to

<P>interfere with his equilibrium.&nbsp; He took a quick step to save

<P>himself from a fall, and remained swaying backwards and forwards.

<P>"Two men," he began again, speaking with difficulty.&nbsp; "Two white

<P>men--men in uniform--honourable men.&nbsp; I want to say--men of

<P>honour.&nbsp; Are you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come! None of that," said the officer impatiently.&nbsp; "Let us have

<P>that friend of yours."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What do you think I am?" asked Almayer, fiercely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are drunk, but not so drunk as not to know what you are

<P>doing.&nbsp; Enough of this tomfoolery," said the officer sternly, "or

<P>I will have you put under arrest in your own house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Arrest!" laughed Almayer, discordantly.&nbsp; "Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Arrest!

<P>Why, I have been trying to get out of this infernal place for

<P>twenty years, and I can't.&nbsp; You hear, man! I can't, and never

<P>shall!&nbsp; Never!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ended his words with a sob, and walked unsteadily down the

<P>stairs.&nbsp; When in the courtyard the lieutenant approached him, and

<P>took him by the arm.&nbsp; The sub-lieutenant and Babalatchi followed

<P>close.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's better, Almayer," said the officer encouragingly.&nbsp; "Where

<P>are you going to?&nbsp; There are only planks there.&nbsp; Here," he
went

<P>on, shaking him slightly, "do we want the boats?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," answered Almayer, viciously.&nbsp; "You want a grave."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?&nbsp; Wild again!&nbsp; Try to talk sense."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Grave!" roared Almayer, struggling to get himself free.&nbsp; "A hole

<P>in the ground.&nbsp; Don't you understand?&nbsp; You must be drunk.&nbsp;
Let me

<P>go!&nbsp; Let go, I tell you!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He tore away from the officer's grasp, and reeled towards the

<P>planks where the body lay under its white cover; then he turned

<P>round quickly, and faced the semicircle of interested faces.&nbsp; The

<P>sun was sinking rapidly, throwing long shadows of house and trees

<P>over the courtyard, but the light lingered yet on the river,

<P>where the logs went drifting past in midstream, looking very

<P>distinct and black in the pale red glow.&nbsp; The trunks of the trees

<P>in the forest on the east bank were lost in gloom while their

<P>highest branches swayed gently in the departing sunlight.&nbsp; The

<P>air felt heavy and cold in the breeze, expiring in slight puffs

<P>that came over the water.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer shivered as he made an effort to speak, and again with an

<P>uncertain gesture he seemed to free his throat from the grip of

<P>an invisible hand.&nbsp; His bloodshot eyes wandered aimlessly from

<P>face to face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There!" he said at last.&nbsp; "Are you all there?&nbsp; He is a dangerous

<P>man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He dragged at the cover with hasty violence, and the body rolled

<P>stiffly off the planks and fell at his feet in rigid

<P>helplessness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cold, perfectly cold," said Almayer, looking round with a

<P>mirthless smile.&nbsp; "Sorry can do no better.&nbsp; And you can't
hang

<P>him, either.&nbsp; As you observe, gentlemen," he added gravely,

<P>"there is no head, and hardly any neck."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last ray of light was snatched away from the tree-tops, the

<P>river grew suddenly dark, and in the great stillness the murmur

<P>of the flowing water seemed to fill the vast expanse of grey

<P>shadow that descended upon the land.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is Dain," went on Almayer to the silent group that

<P>surrounded him.&nbsp; "And I have kept my word.&nbsp; First one hope,
then

<P>another, and this is my last.&nbsp; Nothing is left now.&nbsp; You think

<P>there is one dead man here?&nbsp; Mistake, I 'sure you.&nbsp; I am much

<P>more dead.&nbsp; Why don't you hang me?" he suggested suddenly, in a

<P>friendly tone, addressing the lieutenant.&nbsp; "I assure, assure you

<P>it would be a mat--matter of form altog--altogether."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These last words he muttered to himself, and walked zigzaging

<P>towards his house.&nbsp; "Get out!" he thundered at Ali, who was

<P>approaching timidly with offers of assistance.&nbsp; From afar, scared

<P>groups of men and women watched his devious progress.&nbsp; He dragged

<P>himself up the stairs by the banister, and managed to reach a

<P>chair into which he fell heavily.&nbsp; He sat for awhile panting with

<P>exertion and anger, and looking round vaguely for Nina; then

<P>making a threatening gesture towards the compound, where he had

<P>heard Babalatchi's voice, he overturned the table with his foot

<P>in a great crash of smashed crockery.&nbsp; He muttered yet menacingly

<P>to himself, then his head fell on his breast, his eyes closed,

<P>and with a deep sigh he fell asleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That night--for the first time in its history--the peaceful and

<P>flourishing settlement of Sambir saw the lights shining about

<P>"Almayer's Folly."&nbsp; These were the lanterns of the boats hung up

<P>by the seamen under the verandah where the two officers were

<P>holding a court of inquiry into the truth of the story related to

<P>them by Babalatchi.&nbsp; Babalatchi had regained all his importance.

<P>He was eloquent and persuasive, calling Heaven and Earth to

<P>witness the truth of his statements.&nbsp; There were also other

<P>witnesses.&nbsp; Mahmat Banjer and a good many others underwent a

<P>close examination that dragged its weary length far into the

<P>evening.&nbsp; A messenger was sent for Abdulla, who excused himself

<P>from coming on the score of his venerable age, but sent Reshid.

<P>Mahmat had to produce the bangle, and saw with rage and

<P>mortification the lieutenant put it in his pocket, as one of the

<P>proofs of Dain's death, to be sent in with the official report of

<P>the mission.&nbsp; Babalatchi's ring was also impounded for the same

<P>purpose, but the experienced statesman was resigned to that loss

<P>from the very beginning.&nbsp; He did not mind as long as he was sure,

<P>that the white men believed.&nbsp; He put that question to himself

<P>earnestly as he left, one of the last, when the proceedings came

<P>to a close.&nbsp; He was not certain.&nbsp; Still, if they believed
only

<P>for a night, he would put Dain beyond their reach and feel safe

<P>himself.&nbsp; He walked away fast, looking from time to time over his

<P>shoulder in the fear of being followed, but he saw and heard

<P>nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ten o'clock," said the lieutenant, looking at his watch and

<P>yawning.&nbsp; "I shall hear some of the captain's complimentary

<P>remarks when we get back.&nbsp; Miserable business, this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think all this is true?" asked the younger man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True! It is just possible.&nbsp; But if it isn't true what can we do?

<P>If we had a dozen boats we could patrol the creeks; and that

<P>wouldn't be much good.&nbsp; That drunken madman was right; we haven't

<P>enough hold on this coast.&nbsp; They do what they like.&nbsp; Are our

<P>hammocks slung?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I told the coxswain.&nbsp; Strange couple over there," said the

<P>sub, with a wave of his hand towards Almayer's house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hem! Queer, certainly.&nbsp; What have you been telling her?&nbsp;
I was

<P>attending to the father most of the time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I assure you I have been perfectly civil," protested the other

<P>warmly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All right.&nbsp; Don't get excited.&nbsp; She objects to civility,
then,

<P>from what I understand.&nbsp; I thought you might have been tender.

<P>You know we are on service."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, of course.&nbsp; Never forget that.&nbsp; Coldly civil.&nbsp;
That's

<P>all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They both laughed a little, and not feeling sleepy began to pace

<P>the verandah side by side.&nbsp; The moon rose stealthily above the

<P>trees, and suddenly changed the river into a stream of

<P>scintillating silver.&nbsp; The forest came out of the black void and

<P>stood sombre and pensive over the sparkling water.&nbsp; The breeze

<P>died away into a breathless calm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Seamanlike, the two officers tramped measuredly up and down

<P>without exchanging a word.&nbsp; The loose planks rattled rhythmically

<P>under their steps with obstrusive dry sound in the perfect

<P>silence of the night.&nbsp; As they were wheeling round again the

<P>younger man stood attentive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you hear that?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No!" said the other.&nbsp; "Hear what?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought I heard a cry.&nbsp; Ever so faint.&nbsp; Seemed a woman's

<P>voice.&nbsp; In that other house.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Again!&nbsp; Hear
it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said the lieutenant, after listening awhile.&nbsp; "You young

<P>fellows always hear women's voices.&nbsp; If you are going to dream

<P>you had better get into your hammock.&nbsp; Good-night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The moon mounted higher, and the warm shadows grew smaller and

<P>crept away as if hiding before the cold and cruel light.
