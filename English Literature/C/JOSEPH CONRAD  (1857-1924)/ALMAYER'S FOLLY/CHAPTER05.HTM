<P>At last the excitement had died out in Sambir.&nbsp; The inhabitants

<P>got used to the sight of comings and goings between Almayer's

<P>house and the vessel, now moored to the opposite bank, and

<P>speculation as to the feverish activity displayed by Almayer's

<P>boatmen in repairing old canoes ceased to interfere with the due

<P>discharge of domestic duties by the women of the Settlement.

<P>Even the baffled Jim-Eng left off troubling his muddled brain

<P>with secrets of trade, and relapsed by the aid of his opium pipe

<P>into a state of stupefied bliss, letting Babalatchi pursue his

<P>way past his house uninvited and seemingly unnoticed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So on that warm afternoon, when the deserted river sparkled under

<P>the vertical sun, the statesman of Sambir could, without any

<P>hindrance from friendly inquirers, shove off his little canoe

<P>from under the bushes, where it was usually hidden during his

<P>visits to Almayer's compound.&nbsp; Slowly and languidly Babalatchi

<P>paddled, crouching low in the boat, making himself small under

<P>his as enormous sun hat to escape the scorching heat reflected

<P>from the water.&nbsp; He was not in a hurry; his master, Lakamba, was

<P>surely reposing at this time of the day.&nbsp; He would have ample

<P>time to cross over and greet him on his waking with important

<P>news.&nbsp; Will he be displeased?&nbsp; Will he strike his ebony wood

<P>staff angrily on the floor, frightening him by the incoherent

<P>violence of his exclamations; or will he squat down with a

<P>good-humoured smile, and, rubbing his hands gently over his

<P>stomach with a familiar gesture, expectorate copiously into the

<P>brass siri-vessel, giving vent to a low, approbative murmur?

<P>Such were Babalatchi's thoughts as he skilfully handled his

<P>paddle, crossing the river on his way to the Rajah's campong,

<P>whose stockades showed from behind the dense foliage of the bank

<P>just opposite to Almayer's bungalow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Indeed, he had a report to make.&nbsp; Something certain at last to

<P>confirm the daily tale of suspicions, the daily hints of

<P>familiarity, of stolen glances he had seen, of short and burning

<P>words he had overheard exchanged between Dain Maroola and

<P>Almayer's daughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lakamba had, till then, listened to it all, calmly and with

<P>evident distrust; now he was going to be convinced, for

<P>Babalatchi had the proof; had it this very morning, when fishing

<P>at break of day in the creek over which stood Bulangi's house.

<P>There from his skiff he saw Nina's long canoe drift past, the

<P>girl sitting in the stern bending over Dain, who was stretched in

<P>the bottom with his head resting on the girl's knees.&nbsp; He saw it.

<P>He followed them, but in a short time they took to the paddles

<P>and got away from under his observant eye.&nbsp; A few minutes

<P>afterwards he saw Bulangi's slave-girl paddling in a small

<P>dug-out to the town with her cakes for sale.&nbsp; She also had seen

<P>them in the grey dawn.&nbsp; And Babalatchi grinned confidentially to

<P>himself at the recollection of the slave-girl's discomposed face,

<P>of the hard look in her eyes, of the tremble in her voice, when

<P>answering his questions.&nbsp; That little Taminah evidently admired

<P>Dain Maroola.&nbsp; That was good!&nbsp; And Babalatchi laughed aloud
at

<P>the notion; then becoming suddenly serious, he began by some

<P>strange association of ideas to speculate upon the price for

<P>which Bulangi would, possibly, sell the girl.&nbsp; He shook his head

<P>sadly at the thought that Bulangi was a hard man, and had refused

<P>one hundred dollars for that same Taminah only a few weeks ago;

<P>then he became suddenly aware that the canoe had drifted too far

<P>down during his meditation.&nbsp; He shook off the despondency caused

<P>by the certitude of Bulangi's mercenary disposition, and, taking

<P>up his paddle, in a few strokes sheered alongside the water-gate

<P>of the Rajah's house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That afternoon Almayer, as was his wont lately, moved about on

<P>the water-side, overlooking the repairs to his boats.&nbsp; He had

<P>decided at last.&nbsp; Guided by the scraps of information contained

<P>in old Lingard's pocket-book, he was going to seek for the rich

<P>gold-mine, for that place where he had only to stoop to gather up

<P>an immense fortune and realise the dream of his young days.&nbsp; To

<P>obtain the necessary help he had shared his knowledge with Dain

<P>Maroola, he had consented to be reconciled with Lakamba, who gave

<P>his support to the enterprise on condition of sharing the

<P>profits; he had sacrificed his pride, his honour, and his loyalty

<P>in the face of the enormous risk of his undertaking, dazzled by

<P>the greatness of the results to be achieved by this alliance so

<P>distasteful yet so necessary.&nbsp; The dangers were great, but

<P>Maroola was brave; his men seemed as reckless as their chief, and

<P>with Lakamba's aid success seemed assured.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the last fortnight Almayer was absorbed in the preparations,

<P>walking amongst his workmen and slaves in a kind of waking

<P>trance, where practical details as to the fitting out of the

<P>boats were mixed up with vivid dreams of untold wealth, where the

<P>present misery of burning sun, of the muddy and malodorous river

<P>bank disappeared in a gorgeous vision of a splendid future

<P>existence for himself and Nina.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hardly saw Nina during
these

<P>last days, although the beloved daughter was ever present in his

<P>thoughts.&nbsp; He hardly took notice of Dain, whose constant presence

<P>in his house had become a matter of course to him now they were

<P>connected by a community of interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; When meeting the
young

<P>chief he gave him an absent greeting and passed on, seemingly

<P>wishing to avoid him, bent upon forgetting the hated reality of

<P>the present by absorbing himself in his work, or else by letting

<P>his imagination soar far above the tree-tops into the great white

<P>clouds away to the westward, where the paradise of Europe was

<P>awaiting the future Eastern millionaire.&nbsp; And Maroola, now the

<P>bargain was struck and there was no more business to be talked

<P>over, evidently did not care for the white man's company.&nbsp; Yet

<P>Dain was always about the house, but he seldom stayed long by the

<P>riverside.&nbsp; On his daily visits to the white man the Malay chief

<P>preferred to make his way quietly through the central passage of

<P>the house, and would come out into the garden at the back, where

<P>the fire was burning in the cooking shed, with the rice kettle

<P>swinging over it, under the watchful supervision of Mrs. Almayer.

<P>Avoiding that shed, with its black smoke and the warbling of

<P>soft, feminine voices, Dain would turn to the left.&nbsp; There, on

<P>the edge of a banana plantation, a clump of palms and mango trees

<P>formed a shady spot, a few scattered bushes giving it a certain

<P>seclusion into which only the serving women's chatter or an

<P>occasional burst of laughter could penetrate.&nbsp; Once in, he was

<P>invisible; and hidden there, leaning against the smooth trunk of

<P>a tall palm, he waited with gleaming eyes and an assured smile to

<P>hear the faint rustle of dried grass under the light footsteps of

<P>Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From the very first moment when his eyes beheld this--to him--

<P>perfection of loveliness he felt in his inmost heart the

<P>conviction that she would be his; he felt the subtle breath of

<P>mutual understanding passing between their two savage natures,

<P>and he did not want Mrs. Almayer's encouraging smiles to take

<P>every opportunity of approaching the girl; and every time he

<P>spoke to her, every time he looked into her eyes, Nina, although

<P>averting her face, felt as if this bold-looking being who spoke

<P>burning words into her willing ear was the embodiment of her

<P>fate, the creature of her dreams--reckless, ferocious, ready with

<P>flashing kriss for his enemies, and with passionate embrace for

<P>his beloved--the ideal Malay chief of her mother's tradition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She recognised with a thrill of delicious fear the mysterious

<P>consciousness of her identity with that being.&nbsp; Listening to his

<P>words, it seemed to her she was born only then to a knowledge of

<P>a new existence, that her life was complete only when near him,

<P>and she abandoned herself to a feeling of dreamy happiness, while

<P>with half- veiled face and in silence--as became a Malay

<P>girl--she listened to Dain's words giving up to her the whole

<P>treasure of love and passion his nature was capable of with all

<P>the unrestrained enthusiasm of a man totally untrammelled by any

<P>influence of civilised self-discipline.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And they used to pass many a delicious and fast fleeting hour

<P>under the mango trees behind the friendly curtain of bushes till

<P>Mrs. Almayer's shrill voice gave the signal of unwilling

<P>separation.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer had undertaken the easy task of

<P>watching her husband lest he should interrupt the smooth course

<P>of her daughter's love affair, in which she took a great and

<P>benignant interest.&nbsp; She was happy and proud to see Dain's

<P>infatuation, believing him to be a great and powerful chief, and

<P>she found also a gratification of her mercenary instincts in

<P>Dain's open-handed generosity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the eve of the day when Babalatchi's suspicions were confirmed

<P>by ocular demonstration, Dain and Nina had remained longer than

<P>usual in their shady retreat.&nbsp; Only Almayer's heavy step on the

<P>verandah and his querulous clamour for food decided Mrs. Almayer

<P>to lift a warning cry.&nbsp; Maroola leaped lightly over the low

<P>bamboo fence, and made his way stealthily through the banana

<P>plantation down to the muddy shore of the back creek, while Nina

<P>walked slowly towards the house to minister to her father's

<P>wants, as was her wont every evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almayer felt happy
enough

<P>that evening; the preparations were nearly completed; to-morrow

<P>he would launch his boats.&nbsp; In his mind's eye he saw the rich

<P>prize in his grasp; and, with tin spoon in his hand, he was

<P>forgetting the plateful of rice before him in the fanciful

<P>arrangement of some splendid banquet to take place on his arrival

<P>in Amsterdam.&nbsp; Nina, reclining in the long chair, listened

<P>absently to the few disconnected words escaping from her father's

<P>lips.&nbsp; Expedition!&nbsp; Gold! What did she care for all that?&nbsp;
But at

<P>the name of Maroola mentioned by her father she was all

<P>attention.&nbsp; Dain was going down the river with his brig to-morrow

<P>to remain away for a few days, said Almayer.&nbsp; It was very

<P>annoying, this delay.&nbsp; As soon as Dain returned they would have

<P>to start without loss of time, for the river was rising.&nbsp; He

<P>would not be surprised if a great flood was coming.&nbsp; And he

<P>pushed away his plate with an impatient gesture on rising from

<P>the table.&nbsp; But now Nina heard him not.&nbsp; Dain going away!&nbsp;
That's

<P>why he had ordered her, with that quiet masterfulness it was her

<P>delight to obey, to meet him at break of day in Bulangi's creek.

<P>Was there a paddle in her canoe? she thought.&nbsp; Was it ready?&nbsp;
She

<P>would have to start early--at four in the morning, in a very few

<P>hours.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She rose from her chair, thinking she would require rest before

<P>the long pull in the early morning.&nbsp; The lamp was burning dimly,

<P>and her father, tired with the day's labour, was already in his

<P>hammock.&nbsp; Nina put the lamp out and passed into a large room she

<P>shared with her mother on the left of the central passage.

<P>Entering, she saw that Mrs. Almayer had deserted the pile of mats

<P>serving her as bed in one corner of the room, and was now bending

<P>over the opened lid of her large wooden chest.&nbsp; Half a shell of

<P>cocoanut filled with oil, where a cotton rag floated for a wick,

<P>stood on the floor, surrounding her with a ruddy halo of light

<P>shining through the black and odorous smoke.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer's back

<P>was bent, and her head and shoulders hidden in the deep box.&nbsp; Her

<P>hands rummaged in the interior, where a soft clink as of silver

<P>money could be heard.&nbsp; She did not notice at first her daughter's

<P>approach, and Nina, standing silently by her, looked down on many

<P>little canvas bags ranged in the bottom of the chest, wherefrom

<P>her mother extracted handfuls of shining guilders and Mexican

<P>dollars, letting them stream slowly back again through her

<P>claw-like fingers.&nbsp; The music of tinkling silver seemed to

<P>delight her, and her eyes sparkled with the reflected gleam of

<P>freshly-minted coins.&nbsp; She was muttering to herself: "And this,

<P>and this, and yet this!&nbsp; Soon he will give more--as much more as

<P>I ask.&nbsp; He is a great Rajah--a Son of Heaven!&nbsp; And she will
be a

<P>Ranee--he gave all this for her!&nbsp; Who ever gave anything for me?

<P>I am a slave!&nbsp; Am I?&nbsp; I am the mother of a great Ranee!" She

<P>became aware suddenly of her daughter's presence, and ceased her

<P>droning, shutting the lid down violently; then, without rising

<P>from her crouching position, she looked up at the girl standing

<P>by with a vague smile on her dreamy face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have seen.&nbsp; Have you?" she shouted, shrilly.&nbsp; "That is
all

<P>mine, and for you.&nbsp; It is not enough!&nbsp; He will have to give
more

<P>before he takes you away to the southern island where his father

<P>is king.&nbsp; You hear me?&nbsp; You are worth more, granddaughter
of

<P>Rajahs!&nbsp; More!&nbsp; More!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sleepy voice of Almayer was heard on the verandah

<P>recommending silence.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer extinguished the light and

<P>crept into her corner of the room.&nbsp; Nina laid down on her back
on

<P>a pile of soft mats, her hands entwined under her head, gazing

<P>through the shutterless hole, serving as a window at the stars

<P>twinkling on the black sky; she was awaiting the time of start

<P>for her appointed meeting-place.&nbsp; With quiet happiness she

<P>thought of that meeting in the great forest, far from all human

<P>eyes and sounds.&nbsp; Her soul, lapsing again into the savage mood,

<P>which the genius of civilisation working by the hand of Mrs.

<P>Vinck could never destroy, experienced a feeling of pride and of

<P>some slight trouble at the high value her worldly-wise mother had

<P>put upon her person; but she remembered the expressive glances

<P>and words of Dain, and, tranquillised, she closed her eyes in a

<P>shiver of pleasant anticipation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There are some situations where the barbarian and the, so-called,

<P>civilised man meet upon the same ground.&nbsp; It may be supposed that

<P>Dain Maroola was not exceptionally delighted with his prospective

<P>mother-in-law, nor that he actually approved of that worthy

<P>woman's appetite for shining dollars.&nbsp; Yet on that foggy morning

<P>when Babalatchi, laying aside the cares of state, went to visit

<P>his fish-baskets in the Bulangi creek, Maroola had no misgivings,

<P>experienced no feelings but those of impatience and longing, when

<P>paddling to the east side of the island forming the back-water in

<P>question.&nbsp; He hid his canoe in the bushes and strode rapidly

<P>across the islet, pushing with impatience through the twigs of

<P>heavy undergrowth intercrossed over his path.&nbsp; From motives of

<P>prudence he would not take his canoe to the meeting-place, as

<P>Nina had done.&nbsp; He had left it in the main stream till his return

<P>from the other side of the island.&nbsp; The heavy warm fog was

<P>closing rapidly round him, but he managed to catch a fleeting

<P>glimpse of a light away to the left, proceeding from Bulangi's

<P>house.&nbsp; Then he could see nothing in the thickening vapour, and

<P>kept to the path only by a sort of instinct, which also led him

<P>to the very point on the opposite shore he wished to reach.&nbsp; A

<P>great log had stranded there, at right angles to the bank,

<P>forming a kind of jetty against which the swiftly flowing stream

<P>broke with a loud ripple.&nbsp; He stepped on it with a quick but

<P>steady motion, and in two strides found himself at the outer end,

<P>with the rush and swirl of the foaming water at his feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Standing there alone, as if separated from the world; the

<P>heavens, earth; the very water roaring under him swallowed up in

<P>the thick veil of the morning fog, he breathed out the name of

<P>Nina before him into the apparently limitless space, sure of

<P>being heard, instinctively sure of the nearness of the delightful

<P>creature; certain of her being aware of his near presence as he

<P>was aware of hers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The bow of Nina's canoe loomed up close to the log, canted high

<P>out of the water by the weight of the sitter in the stern.

<P>Maroola laid his hand on the stem and leaped lightly in, giving

<P>it a vigorous shove off.&nbsp; The light craft, obeying the new

<P>impulse, cleared the log by a hair's breadth, and the river, with

<P>obedient complicity, swung it broadside to the current, and bore

<P>it off silently and rapidly between the invisible banks.&nbsp; And

<P>once more Dain, at the feet of Nina, forgot the world, felt

<P>himself carried away helpless by a great wave of supreme emotion,

<P>by a rush of joy, pride, and desire; understood once more with

<P>overpowering certitude that there was no life possible without

<P>that being he held clasped in his arms with passionate strength

<P>in a prolonged embrace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina disengaged herself gently with a low laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will overturn the boat, Dain," she whispered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked into her eyes eagerly for a minute and let her go with

<P>a sigh, then lying down in the canoe he put his head on her

<P>knees, gazing upwards and stretching his arms backwards till his

<P>hands met round the girl's waist.&nbsp; She bent over him, and,

<P>shaking her head, framed both their faces in the falling locks of

<P>her long black hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And so they drifted on, he speaking with all the rude eloquence

<P>of a savage nature giving itself up without restraint to an

<P>overmastering passion, she bending low to catch the murmur of

<P>words sweeter to her than life itself.&nbsp; To those two nothing

<P>existed then outside the gunwales of the narrow and fragile

<P>craft.&nbsp; It was their world, filled with their intense and

<P>all-absorbing love.&nbsp; They took no heed of thickening mist, or of

<P>the breeze dying away before sunrise; they forgot the existence

<P>of the great forests surrounding them, of all the tropical nature

<P>awaiting the advent of the sun in a solemn and impressive

<P>silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Over the low river-mist hiding the boat with its freight of young

<P>passionate life and all-forgetful happiness, the stars paled, and

<P>a silvery-grey tint crept over the sky from the eastward.&nbsp; There

<P>was not a breath of wind, not a rustle of stirring leaf, not a

<P>splash of leaping fish to disturb the serene repose of all living

<P>things on the banks of the great river.&nbsp; Earth, river, and sky

<P>were wrapped up in a deep sleep, from which it seemed there would

<P>be no waking.&nbsp; All the seething life and movement of tropical

<P>nature seemed concentrated in the ardent eyes, in the

<P>tumultuously beating hearts of the two beings drifting in the

<P>canoe, under the white canopy of mist, over the smooth surface of

<P>the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly a great sheaf of yellow rays shot upwards from behind

<P>the black curtain of trees lining the banks of the Pantai.&nbsp; The

<P>stars went out; the little black clouds at the zenith glowed for

<P>a moment with crimson tints, and the thick mist, stirred by the

<P>gentle breeze, the sigh of waking nature, whirled round and broke

<P>into fantastically torn pieces, disclosing the wrinkled surface

<P>of the river sparkling in the broad light of day.&nbsp; Great flocks

<P>of white birds wheeled screaming above the swaying tree-tops.

<P>The sun had risen on the east coast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain was the first to return to the cares of everyday life.&nbsp; He

<P>rose and glanced rapidly up and down the river.&nbsp; His eye detected

<P>Babalatchi's boat astern, and another small black speck on the

<P>glittering water, which was Taminah's canoe.&nbsp; He moved cautiously

<P>forward, and, kneeling, took up a paddle; Nina at the stern took

<P>hers.&nbsp; They bent their bodies to the work, throwing up the water

<P>at every stroke, and the small craft went swiftly ahead, leaving

<P>a narrow wake fringed with a lace-like border of white and

<P>gleaming foam.&nbsp; Without turning his head, Dain spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Somebody behind us, Nina.&nbsp; We must not let him gain.&nbsp; I think
he

<P>is too far to recognise us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Somebody before us also," panted out Nina, without ceasing to

<P>paddle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think I know," rejoined Dain.&nbsp; "The sun shines over there, but

<P>I fancy it is the girl Taminah.&nbsp; She comes down every morning to

<P>my brig to sell cakes--stays often all day.&nbsp; It does not matter;

<P>steer more into the bank; we must get under the bushes.&nbsp; My canoe

<P>is hidden not far from here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he spoke his eyes watched the broad-leaved nipas which they

<P>were brushing in their swift and silent course.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look out, Nina," he said at last; "there, where the water palms

<P>end and the twigs hang down under the leaning tree.&nbsp; Steer for

<P>the big green branch."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stood up attentive, and the boat drifted slowly in shore, Nina

<P>guiding it by a gentle and skilful movement of her paddle.&nbsp; When

<P>near enough Dain laid hold of the big branch, and leaning back

<P>shot the canoe under a low green archway of thickly matted

<P>creepers giving access to a miniature bay formed by the caving in

<P>of the bank during the last great flood.&nbsp; His own boat was there

<P>anchored by a stone, and he stepped into it, keeping his hand on

<P>the gunwale of Nina's canoe.&nbsp; In a moment the two little

<P>nutshells with their occupants floated quietly side by side,

<P>reflected by the black water in the dim light struggling through

<P>a high canopy of dense foliage; while above, away up in the broad

<P>day, flamed immense red blossoms sending down on their heads a

<P>shower of great dew-sparkling petals that descended rotating

<P>slowly in a continuous and perfumed stream; and over them, under

<P>them, in the sleeping water; all around them in a ring of

<P>luxuriant vegetation bathed in the warm air charged with strong

<P>and harsh perfumes, the intense work of tropical nature went on:

<P>plants shooting upward, entwined, interlaced in inextricable

<P>confusion, climbing madly and brutally over each other in the

<P>terrible silence of a desperate struggle towards the life-giving

<P>sunshine above--as if struck with sudden horror at the seething

<P>mass of corruption below, at the death and decay from which they

<P>sprang.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must part now," said Dain, after a long silence.&nbsp; "You must

<P>return at once, Nina.&nbsp; I will wait till the brig drifts down

<P>here, and shall get on board then."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And will you be long away, Dain?" asked Nina, in a low voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Long!" exclaimed Dain.&nbsp; "Would a man willingly remain long in
a

<P>dark place?&nbsp; When I am not near you, Nina, I am like a man that

<P>is blind.&nbsp; What is life to me without light?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina leaned over, and with a proud and happy smile took Dain's

<P>face between her hands, looking into his eyes with a fond yet

<P>questioning gaze.&nbsp; Apparently she found there the confirmation
of

<P>the words just said, for a feeling of grateful security lightened

<P>for her the weight of sorrow at the hour of parting.&nbsp; She

<P>believed that he, the descendant of many great Rajahs, the son of

<P>a great chief, the master of life and death, knew the sunshine of

<P>life only in her presence.&nbsp; An immense wave of gratitude and love

<P>welled forth out of her heart towards him.&nbsp; How could she make
an

<P>outward and visible sign of all she felt for the man who had

<P>filled her heart with so much joy and so much pride?&nbsp; And in the

<P>great tumult of passion, like a flash of lightning came to her

<P>the reminiscence of that despised and almost forgotten

<P>civilisation she had only glanced at in her days of restraint, of

<P>sorrow, and of anger.&nbsp; In the cold ashes of that hateful and

<P>miserable past she would find the sign of love, the fitting

<P>expression of the boundless felicity of the present, the pledge

<P>of a bright and splendid future.&nbsp; She threw her arms around

<P>Dain's neck and pressed her lips to his in a long and burning

<P>kiss.&nbsp; He closed his eyes, surprised and frightened at the storm

<P>raised in his breast by the strange and to him hitherto unknown

<P>contact, and long after Nina had pushed her canoe into the river

<P>he remained motionless, without daring to open his eyes, afraid

<P>to lose the sensation of intoxicating delight he had tasted for

<P>the first time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now he wanted but immortality, he thought, to be the equal of

<P>gods, and the creature that could open so the gates of paradise

<P>must be his--soon would be his for ever!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He opened his eyes in time to see through the archway of creepers

<P>the bows of his brig come slowly into view, as the vessel drifted

<P>past on its way down the river.&nbsp; He must go on board now, he

<P>thought; yet he was loth to leave the place where he had learned

<P>to know what happiness meant.&nbsp; "Time yet.&nbsp; Let them go," he

<P>muttered to himself; and he closed his eyes again under the red

<P>shower of scented petals, trying to recall the scene with all its

<P>delight and all its fear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He must have been able to join his brig in time, after all, and

<P>found much occupation outside, for it was in vain that Almayer

<P>looked for his friend's speedy return.&nbsp; The lower reach of the

<P>river where he so often and so impatiently directed his eyes

<P>remained deserted, save for the rapid flitting of some fishing

<P>canoe; but down the upper reaches came black clouds and heavy

<P>showers heralding the final setting in of the rainy season with

<P>its thunderstorms and great floods making the river almost

<P>impossible of ascent for native canoes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer, strolling along the muddy beach between his houses,

<P>watched uneasily the river rising inch by inch, creeping slowly

<P>nearer to the boats, now ready and hauled up in a row under the

<P>cover of dripping Kajang-mats.&nbsp; Fortune seemed to elude his

<P>grasp, and in his weary tramp backwards and forwards under the

<P>steady rain falling from the lowering sky, a sort of despairing

<P>indifference took possession of him.&nbsp; What did it matter?&nbsp;
It was

<P>just his luck!&nbsp; Those two infernal savages, Lakamba and Dain,

<P>induced him, with their promises of help, to spend his last

<P>dollar in the fitting out of boats, and now one of them was gone

<P>somewhere, and the other shut up in his stockade would give no

<P>sign of life.&nbsp; No, not even the scoundrelly Babalatchi, thought

<P>Almayer, would show his face near him, now they had sold him all

<P>the rice, brass gongs, and cloth necessary for his expedition.

<P>They had his very last coin, and did not care whether he went or

<P>stayed.&nbsp; And with a gesture of abandoned discouragement Almayer

<P>would climb up slowly to the verandah of his new house to get out

<P>of the rain, and leaning on the front rail with his head sunk

<P>between his shoulders he would abandon himself to the current of

<P>bitter thoughts, oblivious of the flight of time and the pangs of

<P>hunger, deaf to the shrill cries of his wife calling him to the

<P>evening meal.&nbsp; When, roused from his sad meditations by the first

<P>roll of the evening thunderstorm, he stumbled slowly towards the

<P>glimmering light of his old house, his half-dead hope made his

<P>ears preternaturally acute to any sound on the river.&nbsp; Several

<P>nights in succession he had heard the splash of paddles and had

<P>seen the indistinct form of a boat, but when hailing the shadowy

<P>apparition, his heart bounding with sudden hope of hearing Dain's

<P>voice, he was disappointed each time by the sulky answer

<P>conveying to him the intelligence that the Arabs were on the

<P>river, bound on a visit to the home-staying Lakamba.&nbsp; This caused

<P>him many sleepless nights, spent in speculating upon the kind of

<P>villainy those estimable personages were hatching now.&nbsp; At last,

<P>when all hope seemed dead, he was overjoyed on hearing Dain's

<P>voice; but Dain also appeared very anxious to see Lakamba, and

<P>Almayer felt uneasy owing to a deep and ineradicable distrust as

<P>to that ruler's disposition towards himself.&nbsp; Still, Dain had

<P>returned at last.&nbsp; Evidently he meant to keep to his bargain.

<P>Hope revived, and that night Almayer slept soundly, while Nina

<P>watched the angry river under the lash of the thunderstorm

<P>sweeping onward towards the sea.
