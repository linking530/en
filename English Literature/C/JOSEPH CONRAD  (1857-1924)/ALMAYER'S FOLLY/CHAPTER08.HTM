<P>The news as to the identity of the body lying now in Almayer's

<P>compound spread rapidly over the settlement.&nbsp; During the forenoon

<P>most of the inhabitants remained in the long street discussing

<P>the mysterious return and the unexpected death of the man who had

<P>become known to them as the trader.&nbsp; His arrival during the

<P>north-east monsoon, his long sojourn in their midst, his sudden

<P>departure with his brig, and, above all, the mysterious

<P>appearance of the body, said to be his, amongst the logs, were

<P>subjects to wonder at and to talk over and over again with

<P>undiminished interest.&nbsp; Mahmat moved from house to house and from

<P>group to group, always ready to repeat his tale:&nbsp; how he saw the

<P>body caught by the sarong in a forked log; how Mrs. Almayer

<P>coming, one of the first, at his cries, recognised it, even

<P>before he had it hauled on shore; how Babalatchi ordered him to

<P>bring it out of the water.&nbsp; "By the feet I dragged him in, and

<P>there was no head," exclaimed Mahmat, "and how could the white

<P>man's wife know who it was?&nbsp; She was a witch, it was well known.

<P>And did you see how the white man himself ran away at the sight

<P>of the body?&nbsp; Like a deer he ran!"&nbsp; And here Mahmat imitated

<P>Almayer's long strides, to the great joy of the beholders.&nbsp; And

<P>for all his trouble he had nothing.&nbsp; The ring with the green

<P>stone Tuan Babalatchi kept.&nbsp; "Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing!"&nbsp; He
spat down

<P>at his feet in sign of disgust, and left that group to seek

<P>further on a fresh audience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The news spreading to the furthermost parts of the settlement

<P>found out Abdulla in the cool recess of his godown, where he sat

<P>overlooking his Arab clerks and the men loading and unloading the

<P>up-country canoes.&nbsp; Reshid, who was busy on the jetty, was

<P>summoned into his uncle's presence and found him, as usual, very

<P>calm and even cheerful, but very much surprised.&nbsp; The rumour of

<P>the capture or destruction of Dain's brig had reached the Arab's

<P>ears three days before from the sea-fishermen and through the

<P>dwellers on the lower reaches of the river.&nbsp; It had been passed

<P>up-stream from neighbour to neighbour till Bulangi, whose

<P>clearing was nearest to the settlement, had brought that news

<P>himself to Abdulla whose favour he courted.&nbsp; But rumour also

<P>spoke of a fight and of Dain's death on board his own vessel.

<P>And now all the settlement talked of Dain's visit to the Rajah

<P>and of his death when crossing the river in the dark to see

<P>Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They could not understand this.&nbsp; Reshid thought that it was very

<P>strange.&nbsp; He felt uneasy and doubtful.&nbsp; But Abdulla, after
the

<P>first shock of surprise, with the old age's dislike for solving

<P>riddles, showed a becoming resignation.&nbsp; He remarked that the man

<P>was dead now at all events, and consequently no more dangerous.

<P>Where was the use to wonder at the decrees of Fate, especially if

<P>they were propitious to the True Believers?&nbsp; And with a pious

<P>ejaculation to Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate, Abdulla

<P>seemed to regard the incident as closed for the present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not so Reshid.&nbsp; He lingered by his uncle, pulling thoughtfully

<P>his neatly trimmed beard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There are many lies," he murmured.&nbsp; "He has been dead once

<P>before, and came to life to die again now.&nbsp; The Dutch will be

<P>here before many days and clamour for the man.&nbsp; Shall I not

<P>believe my eyes sooner than the tongues of women and idle men?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They say that the body is being taken to Almayer's compound,"

<P>said Abdulla.&nbsp; "If you want to go there you must go before the

<P>Dutch arrive here.&nbsp; Go late.&nbsp; It should not be said that we
have

<P>been seen inside that man's enclosure lately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Reshid assented to the truth of this last remark and left his

<P>uncle's side.&nbsp; He leaned against the lintel of the big doorway

<P>and looked idly across the courtyard through the open gate on to

<P>the main road of the settlement.&nbsp; It lay empty, straight, and

<P>yellow under the flood of light.&nbsp; In the hot noontide the smooth

<P>trunks of palm trees, the outlines of the houses, and away there

<P>at the other end of the road the roof of Almayer's house visible

<P>over the bushes on the dark background of forest, seemed to

<P>quiver in the heat radiating from the steaming earth.&nbsp; Swarms of

<P>yellow butterflies rose, and settled to rise again in short

<P>flights before Reshid's half-closed eyes.&nbsp; From under his feet

<P>arose the dull hum of insects in the long grass of the courtyard.

<P>He looked on sleepily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From one of the side paths amongst the houses a woman stepped out

<P>on the road, a slight girlish figure walking under the shade of a

<P>large tray balanced on its head.&nbsp; The consciousness of something

<P>moving stirred Reshid's half-sleeping senses into a comparative

<P>wakefulness.&nbsp; He recognised Taminah, Bulangi's slave-girl, with

<P>her tray of cakes for sale--an apparition of daily recurrence and

<P>of no importance whatever.&nbsp; She was going towards Almayer's

<P>house.&nbsp; She could be made useful.&nbsp; He roused himself up and
ran

<P>towards the gate calling out, "Taminah O!"&nbsp; The girl stopped,

<P>hesitated, and came back slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Reshid waited, signing to her impatiently to come nearer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When near Reshid Taminah stood with downcast eyes.&nbsp; Reshid looked

<P>at her a while before he asked--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you going to Almayer's house? They say in the settlement

<P>that Dain the trader, he that was found drowned this morning, is

<P>lying in the white man's campong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have heard this talk," whispered Taminah; "and this morning by

<P>the riverside I saw the body.&nbsp; Where it is now I do not know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So you have seen it?" asked Reshid, eagerly.&nbsp; "Is it Dain?&nbsp;
You

<P>have seen him many times.&nbsp; You would know him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl's lips quivered and she remained silent for a while,

<P>breathing quickly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have seen him, not a long time ago," she said at last.&nbsp; "The

<P>talk is true; he is dead.&nbsp; What do you want from me, Tuan?&nbsp;
I

<P>must go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Just then the report of the gun fired on board the steam launch

<P>was heard, interrupting Reshid's reply.&nbsp; Leaving the girl he ran

<P>to the house, and met in the courtyard Abdulla coming towards the

<P>gate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Orang Blanda are come," said Reshid, "and now we shall have

<P>our reward."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Abdulla shook his head doubtfully.&nbsp; "The white men's rewards are

<P>long in coming," he said.&nbsp; "White men are quick in anger and slow

<P>in gratitude.&nbsp; We shall see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stood at the gate stroking his grey beard and listening to the

<P>distant cries of greeting at the other end of the settlement.&nbsp;
As

<P>Taminah was turning to go he called her back
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Listen, girl," he said: "there will be many white men in

<P>Almayer's house.&nbsp; You shall be there selling your cakes to the

<P>men of the sea.&nbsp; What you see and what you hear you may tell me.

<P>Come here before the sun sets and I will give you a blue

<P>handkerchief with red spots.&nbsp; Now go, and forget not to return."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He gave her a push with the end of his long staff as she was

<P>going away and made her stumble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This slave is very slow," he remarked to his nephew, looking

<P>after the girl with great disfavour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Taminah walked on, her tray on the head, her eyes fixed on the

<P>ground.&nbsp; From the open doors of the houses were heard, as she

<P>passed, friendly calls inviting her within for business purposes,

<P>but she never heeded them, neglecting her sales in the

<P>preoccupation of intense thinking.&nbsp; Since the very early morning

<P>she had heard much, she had also seen much that filled her heart

<P>with a joy mingled with great suffering and fear.&nbsp; Before the

<P>dawn, before she left Bulangi's house to paddle up to Sambir she

<P>had heard voices outside the house when all in it but herself

<P>were asleep.&nbsp; And now, with her knowledge of the words spoken in

<P>the darkness, she held in her hand a life and carried in her

<P>breast a great sorrow.&nbsp; Yet from her springy step, erect figure,

<P>and face veiled over by the everyday look of apathetic

<P>indifference, nobody could have guessed of the double load she

<P>carried under the visible burden of the tray piled up high with

<P>cakes manufactured by the thrifty hands of Bulangi's wives.&nbsp; In

<P>that supple figure straight as an arrow, so graceful and free in

<P>its walk, behind those soft eyes that spoke of nothing but of

<P>unconscious resignation, there slept all feelings and all

<P>passions, all hopes and all fears, the curse of life and the

<P>consolation of death.&nbsp; And she knew nothing of it all.&nbsp; She
lived

<P>like the tall palms amongst whom she was passing now, seeking the

<P>light, desiring the sunshine, fearing the storm, unconscious of

<P>either.&nbsp; The slave had no hope, and knew of no change.&nbsp; She
knew

<P>of no other sky, no other water, no other forest, no other world,

<P>no other life.&nbsp; She had no wish, no hope, no love, no fear except

<P>of a blow, and no vivid feeling but that of occasional hunger,

<P>which was seldom, for Bulangi was rich and rice was plentiful in

<P>the solitary house in his clearing.&nbsp; The absence of pain and

<P>hunger was her happiness, and when she felt unhappy she was

<P>simply tired, more than usual, after the day's labour.&nbsp; Then in

<P>the hot nights of the south-west monsoon she slept dreamlessly

<P>under the bright stars on the platform built outside the house

<P>and over the river.&nbsp; Inside they slept too: Bulangi by the door;

<P>his wives further in; the children with their mothers.&nbsp; She could

<P>hear their breathing; Bulangi's sleepy voice; the sharp cry of a

<P>child soon hushed with tender words.&nbsp; And she closed her eyes to

<P>the murmur of the water below her, to the whisper of the warm

<P>wind above, ignorant of the never-ceasing life of that tropical

<P>nature that spoke to her in vain with the thousand faint voices

<P>of the near forest, with the breath of tepid wind; in the heavy

<P>scents that lingered around her head; in the white wraiths of

<P>morning mist that hung over her in the solemn hush of all

<P>creation before the dawn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such had been her existence before the coming of the brig with

<P>the strangers.&nbsp; She remembered well that time; the uproar in the

<P>settlement, the never-ending wonder, the days and nights of talk

<P>and excitement.&nbsp; She remembered her own timidity with the strange

<P>men, till the brig moored to the bank became in a manner part of

<P>the settlement, and the fear wore off in the familiarity of

<P>constant intercourse.&nbsp; The call on board then became part of her

<P>daily round.&nbsp; She walked hesitatingly up the slanting planks of

<P>the gangway amidst the encouraging shouts and more or less decent

<P>jokes of the men idling over the bulwarks.&nbsp; There she sold her

<P>wares to those men that spoke so loud and carried themselves so

<P>free.&nbsp; There was a throng, a constant coming and going; calls

<P>interchanged, orders given and executed with shouts; the rattle

<P>of blocks, the flinging about of coils of rope.&nbsp; She sat out of

<P>the way under the shade of the awning, with her tray before her,

<P>the veil drawn well over her face, feeling shy amongst so many

<P>men.&nbsp; She smiled at all buyers, but spoke to none, letting their

<P>jests pass with stolid unconcern.&nbsp; She heard many tales told

<P>around her of far-off countries, of strange customs, of events

<P>stranger still.&nbsp; Those men were brave; but the most fearless of

<P>them spoke of their chief with fear.&nbsp; Often the man they called

<P>their master passed before her, walking erect and indifferent, in

<P>the pride of youth, in the flash of rich dress, with a tinkle of

<P>gold ornaments, while everybody stood aside watching anxiously

<P>for a movement of his lips, ready to do his bidding.&nbsp; Then all

<P>her life seemed to rush into her eyes, and from under her veil

<P>she gazed at him, charmed, yet fearful to attract attention.&nbsp; One

<P>day he noticed her and asked, "Who is that girl?"&nbsp; "A slave,

<P>Tuan!&nbsp; A girl that sells cakes," a dozen voices replied together.

<P>She rose in terror to run on shore, when he called her back; and

<P>as she stood trembling with head hung down before him, he spoke

<P>kind words, lifting her chin with his hand and looking into her

<P>eyes with a smile.&nbsp; "Do not be afraid," he said.&nbsp; He never
spoke

<P>to her any more.&nbsp; Somebody called out from the river bank; he

<P>turned away and forgot her existence.&nbsp; Taminah saw Almayer

<P>standing on the shore with Nina on his arm.&nbsp; She heard Nina's

<P>voice calling out gaily, and saw Dain's face brighten with joy as

<P>he leaped on shore.&nbsp; She hated the sound of that voice ever

<P>since.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After that day she left off visiting Almayer's compound, and

<P>passed the noon hours under the shade of the brig awning.&nbsp; She

<P>watched for his coming with heart beating quicker and quicker, as

<P>he approached, into a wild tumult of newly-aroused feelings of

<P>joy and hope and fear that died away with Dain's retreating

<P>figure, leaving her tired out, as if after a struggle, sitting

<P>still for a long time in dreamy languor.&nbsp; Then she paddled home

<P>slowly in the afternoon, often letting her canoe float with the

<P>lazy stream in the quiet backwater of the river.&nbsp; The paddle hung

<P>idle in the water as she sat in the stern, one hand supporting

<P>her chin, her eyes wide open, listening intently to the

<P>whispering of her heart that seemed to swell at last into a song

<P>of extreme sweetness.&nbsp; Listening to that song she husked the rice

<P>at home; it dulled her ears to the shrill bickerings of Bulangi's

<P>wives, to the sound of angry reproaches addressed to herself.

<P>And when the sun was near its setting she walked to the

<P>bathing-place and heard it as she stood on the tender grass of

<P>the low bank, her robe at her feet, and looked at the reflection

<P>of her figure on the glass-like surface of the creek.&nbsp; Listening

<P>to it she walked slowly back, her wet hair hanging over her

<P>shoulders; laying down to rest under the bright stars, she closed

<P>her eyes to the murmur of the water below, of the warm wind

<P>above; to the voice of nature speaking through the faint noises

<P>of the great forest, and to the song of her own heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She heard, but did not understand, and drank in the dreamy joy of

<P>her new existence without troubling about its meaning or its end,

<P>till the full consciousness of life came to her through pain and

<P>anger.&nbsp; And she suffered horribly the first time she saw Nina's

<P>long canoe drift silently past the sleeping house of Bulangi,

<P>bearing the two lovers into the white mist of the great river.

<P>Her jealousy and rage culminated into a paroxysm of physical pain

<P>that left her lying panting on the river bank, in the dumb agony

<P>of a wounded animal.&nbsp; But she went on moving patiently in the

<P>enchanted circle of slavery, going through her task day after day

<P>with all the pathos of the grief she could not express, even to

<P>herself, locked within her breast.&nbsp; She shrank from Nina as she

<P>would have shrunk from the sharp blade of a knife cutting into

<P>her flesh, but she kept on visiting the brig to feed her dumb,

<P>ignorant soul on her own despair.&nbsp; She saw Dain many times.&nbsp;
He

<P>never spoke, he never looked.&nbsp; Could his eyes see only one

<P>woman's image?&nbsp; Could his ears hear only one woman's voice?&nbsp;
He

<P>never noticed her; not once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And then he went away.&nbsp; She saw him and Nina for the last time
on

<P>that morning when Babalatchi, while visiting his fish baskets,

<P>had his suspicions of the white man's daughter's love affair with

<P>Dain confirmed beyond the shadow of doubt.&nbsp; Dain disappeared, and

<P>Taminah's heart, where lay useless and barren the seeds of all

<P>love and of all hate, the possibilities of all passions and of

<P>all sacrifices, forgot its joys and its sufferings when deprived

<P>of the help of the senses.&nbsp; Her half-formed, savage mind, the

<P>slave of her body--as her body was the slave of another's

<P>will--forgot the faint and vague image of the ideal that had

<P>found its beginning in the physical promptings of her savage

<P>nature.&nbsp; She dropped back into the torpor of her former life and

<P>found consolation--even a certain kind of happiness--in the

<P>thought that now Nina and Dain were separated, probably for ever.

<P>He would forget.&nbsp; This thought soothed the last pangs of dying

<P>jealousy that had nothing now to feed upon, and Taminah found

<P>peace.&nbsp; It was like the dreary tranquillity of a desert, where

<P>there is peace only because there is no life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And now he had returned.&nbsp; She had recognised his voice calling

<P>aloud in the night for Bulangi.&nbsp; She had crept out after her

<P>master to listen closer to the intoxicating sound.&nbsp; Dain was

<P>there, in a boat, talking to Bulangi.&nbsp; Taminah, listening with

<P>arrested breath, heard another voice.&nbsp; The maddening joy, that

<P>only a second before she thought herself incapable of containing

<P>within her fast-beating heart, died out, and left her shivering

<P>in the old anguish of physical pain that she had suffered once

<P>before at the sight of Dain and Nina.&nbsp; Nina spoke now, ordering

<P>and entreating in turns, and Bulangi was refusing, expostulating,

<P>at last consenting.&nbsp; He went in to take a paddle from the heap

<P>lying behind the door.&nbsp; Outside the murmur of two voices went on,

<P>and she caught a word here and there.&nbsp; She understood that he was

<P>fleeing from white men, that he was seeking a hiding-place, that

<P>he was in some danger.&nbsp; But she heard also words which woke the

<P>rage of jealousy that had been asleep for so many days in her

<P>bosom.&nbsp; Crouching low on the mud in the black darkness amongst

<P>the piles, she heard the whisper in the boat that made light of

<P>toil, of privation, of danger, of life itself, if in exchange

<P>there could be but a short moment of close embrace, a look from

<P>the eyes, the feel of light breath, the touch of soft lips.&nbsp; So

<P>spoke Dain as he sat in the canoe holding Nina's hands while

<P>waiting for Bulangi's return; and Taminah, supporting herself by

<P>the slimy pile, felt as if a heavy weight was crushing her down,

<P>down into the black oily water at her feet.&nbsp; She wanted to cry

<P>out; to rush at them and tear their vague shadows apart; to throw

<P>Nina into the smooth water, cling to her close, hold her to the

<P>bottom where that man could not find her.&nbsp; She could not cry, she

<P>could not move.&nbsp; Then footsteps were heard on the bamboo platform

<P>above her head; she saw Bulangi get into his smallest canoe and

<P>take the lead, the other boat following, paddled by Dain and

<P>Nina.&nbsp; With a slight splash of the paddles dipped stealthily into

<P>the water, their indistinct forms passed before her aching eyes

<P>and vanished in the darkness of the creek.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She remained there in the cold and wet, powerless to move,

<P>breathing painfully under the crushing weight that the mysterious

<P>hand of Fate had laid so suddenly upon her slender shoulders, and

<P>shivering, she felt within a burning fire, that seemed to feed

<P>upon her very life.&nbsp; When the breaking day had spread a pale

<P>golden ribbon over the black outline of the forests, she took up

<P>her tray and departed towards the settlement, going about her

<P>task purely from the force of habit.&nbsp; As she approached Sambir

<P>she could see the excitement and she heard with momentary

<P>surprise of the finding of Dain's body.&nbsp; It was not true, of

<P>course.&nbsp; She knew it well.&nbsp; She regretted that he was not
dead.

<P>She should have liked Dain to be dead, so as to be parted from

<P>that woman--from all women.&nbsp; She felt a strong desire to see

<P>Nina, but without any clear object.&nbsp; She hated her, and feared

<P>her and she felt an irresistible impulse pushing her towards

<P>Almayer's house to see the white woman's face, to look close at

<P>those eyes, to hear again that voice, for the sound of which Dain

<P>was ready to risk his liberty, his life even.&nbsp; She had seen her

<P>many times; she had heard her voice daily for many months past.

<P>What was there in her?&nbsp; What was there in that being to make a

<P>man speak as Dain had spoken, to make him blind to all other

<P>faces, deaf to all other voices?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She left the crowd by the riverside, and wandered aimlessly among

<P>the empty houses, resisting the impulse that pushed her towards

<P>Almayer's campong to seek there in Nina's eyes the secret of her

<P>own misery.&nbsp; The sun mounting higher, shortened the shadows and

<P>poured down upon her a flood of light and of stifling heat as she

<P>passed on from shadow to light, from light to shadow, amongst the

<P>houses, the bushes, the tall trees, in her unconscious flight

<P>from the pain in her own heart.&nbsp; In the extremity of her distress

<P>she could find no words to pray for relief, she knew of no heaven

<P>to send her prayer to, and she wandered on with tired feet in the

<P>dumb surprise and terror at the injustice of the suffering

<P>inflicted upon her without cause and without redress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The short talk with Reshid, the proposal of Abdulla steadied her

<P>a little and turned her thoughts into another channel.&nbsp; Dain was

<P>in some danger.&nbsp; He was hiding from white men.&nbsp; So much she
had

<P>overheard last night.&nbsp; They all thought him dead.&nbsp; She knew
he

<P>was alive, and she knew of his hiding-place.&nbsp; What did the Arabs

<P>want to know about the white men?&nbsp; The white men want with Dain?

<P>Did they wish to kill him?&nbsp; She could tell them all--no, she

<P>would say nothing, and in the night she would go to him and sell

<P>him his life for a word, for a smile, for a gesture even, and be

<P>his slave in far-off countries, away from Nina.&nbsp; But there were

<P>dangers.&nbsp; The one-eyed Babalatchi who knew everything; the white

<P>man's wife--she was a witch.&nbsp; Perhaps they would tell.&nbsp; And
then

<P>there was Nina.&nbsp; She must hurry on and see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In her impatience she left the path and ran towards Almayer's

<P>dwelling through the undergrowth between the palm trees.&nbsp; She

<P>came out at the back of the house, where a narrow ditch, full of

<P>stagnant water that overflowed from the river, separated

<P>Almayer's campong from the rest of the settlement.&nbsp; The thick

<P>bushes growing on the bank were hiding from her sight the large

<P>courtyard with its cooking shed.&nbsp; Above them rose several thin

<P>columns of smoke, and from behind the sound of strange voices

<P>informed Taminah that the Men of the Sea belonging to the warship

<P>had already landed and were camped between the ditch and the

<P>house.&nbsp; To the left one of Almayer's slave-girls came down to the

<P>ditch and bent over the shiny water, washing a kettle.&nbsp; To the

<P>right the tops of the banana plantation, visible above the

<P>bushes, swayed and shook under the touch of invisible hands

<P>gathering the fruit.&nbsp; On the calm water several canoes moored to

<P>a heavy stake were crowded together, nearly bridging the ditch

<P>just at the place where Taminah stood.&nbsp; The voices in the

<P>courtyard rose at times into an outburst of calls, replies, and

<P>laughter, and then died away into a silence that soon was broken

<P>again by a fresh clamour.&nbsp; Now and again the thin blue smoke

<P>rushed out thicker and blacker, and drove in odorous masses over

<P>the creek, wrapping her for a moment in a suffocating veil; then,

<P>as the fresh wood caught well alight, the smoke vanished in the

<P>bright sunlight, and only the scent of aromatic wood drifted

<P>afar, to leeward of the crackling fires.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Taminah rested her tray on a stump of a tree, and remained

<P>standing with her eyes turned towards Almayer's house, whose roof

<P>and part of a whitewashed wall were visible over the bushes.&nbsp; The

<P>slave-girl finished her work, and after looking for a while

<P>curiously at Taminah, pushed her way through the dense thicket

<P>back to the courtyard.&nbsp; Round Taminah there was now a complete

<P>solitude.&nbsp; She threw herself down on the ground, and hid her face

<P>in her hands.&nbsp; Now when so close she had no courage to see Nina.

<P>At every burst of louder voices from the courtyard she shivered

<P>in the fear of hearing Nina's voice.&nbsp; She came to the resolution

<P>of waiting where she was till dark, and then going straight to

<P>Dain's hiding-place.&nbsp; From where she was she could watch the

<P>movements of white men, of Nina, of all Dain's friends, and of

<P>all his enemies.&nbsp; Both were hateful alike to her, for both would

<P>take him away beyond her reach.&nbsp; She hid herself in the long

<P>grass to wait anxiously for the sunset that seemed so slow to

<P>come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the other side of the ditch, behind the bush, by the clear

<P>fires, the seamen of the frigate had encamped on the hospitable

<P>invitation of Almayer.&nbsp; Almayer, roused out of his apathy by the

<P>prayers and importunity of Nina, had managed to get down in time

<P>to the jetty so as to receive the officers at their landing.&nbsp; The

<P>lieutenant in command accepted his invitation to his house with

<P>the remark that in any case their business was with Almayer--and

<P>perhaps not very pleasant, he added.&nbsp; Almayer hardly heard him.

<P>He shook hands with them absently and led the way towards the

<P>house.&nbsp; He was scarcely conscious of the polite words of welcome

<P>he greeted the strangers with, and afterwards repeated several

<P>times over again in his efforts to appear at ease.&nbsp; The agitation

<P>of their host did not escape the officer's eyes, and the chief

<P>confided to his subordinate, in a low voice, his doubts as to

<P>Almayer's sobriety.&nbsp; The young sub-lieutenant laughed and

<P>expressed in a whisper the hope that the white man was not

<P>intoxicated enough to neglect the offer of some refreshments.

<P>"He does not seem very dangerous," he added, as they followed

<P>Almayer up the steps of the verandah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, he seems more of a fool than a knave; I have heard of him,"

<P>returned the senior.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They sat around the table.&nbsp; Almayer with shaking hands made gin

<P>cocktails, offered them all round, and drank himself, with every

<P>gulp feeling stronger, steadier, and better able to face all the

<P>difficulties of his position.&nbsp; Ignorant of the fate of the brig

<P>he did not suspect the real object of the officer's visit.&nbsp; He

<P>had a general notion that something must have leaked out about

<P>the gunpowder trade, but apprehended nothing beyond some

<P>temporary inconveniences.&nbsp; After emptying his glass he began to

<P>chat easily, lying back in his chair with one of his legs thrown

<P>negligently over the arm.&nbsp; The lieutenant astride on his chair,
a

<P>glowing cheroot in the corner of his mouth, listened with a sly

<P>smile from behind the thick volumes of smoke that escaped from

<P>his compressed lips.&nbsp; The young sub-lieutenant, leaning with both

<P>elbows on the table, his head between his hands, looked on

<P>sleepily in the torpor induced by fatigue and the gin.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>talked on--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a great pleasure to see white faces here.&nbsp; I have lived

<P>here many years in great solitude.&nbsp; The Malays, you understand,

<P>are not company for a white man; moreover they are not friendly;

<P>they do not understand our ways.&nbsp; Great rascals they are.&nbsp;
I

<P>believe I am the only white man on the east coast that is a

<P>settled resident.&nbsp; We get visitors from Macassar or Singapore

<P>sometimes--traders, agents, or explorers, but they are rare.

<P>There was a scientific explorer here a year or more ago.&nbsp; He

<P>lived in my house:&nbsp; drank from morning to night.&nbsp; He lived

<P>joyously for a few months, and when the liquor he brought with

<P>him was gone he returned to Batavia with a report on the mineral

<P>wealth of the interior.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Good, is it not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ceased abruptly and looked at his guests with a meaningless

<P>stare.&nbsp; While they laughed he was reciting to himself the old

<P>story: "Dain dead, all my plans destroyed.&nbsp; This is the end of

<P>all hope and of all things."&nbsp; His heart sank within him.&nbsp;
He felt

<P>a kind of deadly sickness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very good.&nbsp; Capital!" exclaimed both officers.&nbsp; Almayer came
out

<P>of his despondency with another burst of talk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh! what about the dinner?&nbsp; You have got a cook with you.

<P>That's all right.&nbsp; There is a cooking shed in the other

<P>courtyard.&nbsp; I can give you a goose.&nbsp; Look at my geese--the
only

<P>geese on the east coast--perhaps on the whole island.&nbsp; Is that

<P>your cook?&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; Here, Ali, show this Chinaman the
cooking

<P>place and tell Mem Almayer to let him have room there.&nbsp; My wife,

<P>gentlemen, does not come out; my daughter may.&nbsp; Meantime have

<P>some more drink.&nbsp; It is a hot day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant took the cigar out of his mouth, looked at the ash

<P>critically, shook it off and turned towards Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have a rather unpleasant business with you," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry," returned Almayer.&nbsp; "It can be nothing very serious,

<P>surely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you think an attempt to blow up forty men at least, not a

<P>serious matter you will not find many people of your opinion,"

<P>retorted the officer sharply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Blow up!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I know nothing about it" exclaimed Almayer.

<P>"Who did that, or tried to do it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A man with whom you had some dealings," answered the lieutenant.

<P>"He passed here under the name of Dain Maroola.&nbsp; You sold him the

<P>gunpowder he had in that brig we captured."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How did you hear about the brig?" asked Almayer.&nbsp; "I know

<P>nothing about the powder he may have had."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"An Arab trader of this place has sent the information about your

<P>goings on here to Batavia, a couple of months ago," said the

<P>officer.&nbsp; "We were waiting for the brig outside, but he slipped

<P>past us at the mouth of the river, and we had to chase the fellow

<P>to the southward.&nbsp; When he sighted us he ran inside the reefs and

<P>put the brig ashore.&nbsp; The crew escaped in boats before we could

<P>take possession.&nbsp; As our boats neared the craft it blew up with
a

<P>tremendous explosion; one of the boats being too near got

<P>swamped.&nbsp; Two men drowned--that is the result of your

<P>speculation, Mr. Almayer.&nbsp; Now we want this Dain.&nbsp; We have
good

<P>grounds to suppose he is hiding in Sambir.&nbsp; Do you know
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>where he is?&nbsp; You had better put yourself right with the

<P>authorities as much as possible by being perfectly frank with me.

<P>Where is this Dain?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer got up and walked towards the balustrade of the verandah.

<P>He seemed not to be thinking of the officer's question.&nbsp; He

<P>looked at the body laying straight and rigid under its white

<P>cover on which the sun, declining amongst the clouds to the

<P>westward, threw a pale tinge of red.&nbsp; The lieutenant waited for

<P>the answer, taking quick pulls at his half-extinguished cigar.

<P>Behind them Ali moved noiselessly laying the table, ranging

<P>solemnly the ill-assorted and shabby crockery, the tin spoons,

<P>the forks with broken prongs, and the knives with saw-like blades

<P>and loose handles.&nbsp; He had almost forgotten how to prepare the

<P>table for white men.&nbsp; He felt aggrieved; Mem Nina would not help

<P>him.&nbsp; He stepped back to look at his work admiringly, feeling

<P>very proud.&nbsp; This must be right; and if the master afterwards is

<P>angry and swears, then so much the worse for Mem Nina.&nbsp; Why did

<P>she not help?&nbsp; He left the verandah to fetch the dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Mr. Almayer, will you answer my question as frankly as it

<P>is put to you?" asked the lieutenant, after a long silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer turned round and looked at his interlocutor steadily.

<P>"If you catch this Dain what will you do with him?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The officer's face flushed.&nbsp; "This is not an answer," he said,

<P>annoyed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And what will you do with me?" went on Almayer, not heeding the

<P>interruption.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you inclined to bargain?" growled the other.&nbsp; "It would be

<P>bad policy, I assure you.&nbsp; At present I have no orders about your

<P>person, but we expected your assistance in catching this Malay."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!" interrupted Almayer, "just so: you can do nothing without

<P>me, and I, knowing the man well, am to help you in finding him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is exactly what we expect," assented the officer.&nbsp; "You

<P>have broken the law, Mr. Almayer, and you ought to make amends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And save myself?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, in a sense yes.&nbsp; Your head is not in any danger," said the

<P>lieutenant, with a short laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well," said Almayer, with decision, "I shall deliver the

<P>man up to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Both officers rose to their feet quickly, and looked for their

<P>side-arms which they had unbuckled.&nbsp; Almayer laughed harshly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Steady, gentlemen!" he exclaimed.&nbsp; "In my own time and in my own

<P>way.&nbsp; After dinner, gentlemen, you shall have him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is preposterous," urged the lieutenant.&nbsp; "Mr. Almayer, this

<P>is no joking matter.&nbsp; The man is a criminal.&nbsp; He deserves
to

<P>hang.&nbsp; While we dine he may escape; the rumour of our arrival--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer walked towards the table.&nbsp; "I give you my word of honour,

<P>gentlemen, that he shall not escape; I have him safe enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The arrest should be effected before dark," remarked the young

<P>sub.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall hold you responsible for any failure.&nbsp; We are ready, but

<P>can do nothing just now without you," added the senior, with

<P>evident annoyance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer made a gesture of assent.&nbsp; "On my word of honour," he

<P>repeated vaguely.&nbsp; "And now let us dine," he added briskly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina came through the doorway and stood for a moment holding the

<P>curtain aside for Ali and the old Malay woman bearing the dishes;

<P>then she moved towards the three men by the table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Allow me," said Almayer, pompously.&nbsp; "This is my daughter.

<P>Nina, these gentlemen, officers of the frigate outside, have done

<P>me the honour to accept my hospitality."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina answered the low bows of the two officers by a slow

<P>inclination of the head and took her place at the table opposite

<P>her father.&nbsp; All sat down.&nbsp; The coxswain of the steam launch
came

<P>up carrying some bottles of wine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will allow me to have this put upon the table?" said the

<P>lieutenant to Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What! Wine! You are very kind.&nbsp; Certainly, I have none myself.

<P>Times are very hard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last words of his reply were spoken by Almayer in a faltering

<P>voice.&nbsp; The thought that Dain was dead recurred to him vividly

<P>again, and he felt as if an invisible hand was gripping his

<P>throat.&nbsp; He reached for the gin bottle while they were uncorking

<P>the wine and swallowed a big gulp.&nbsp; The lieutenant, who was

<P>speaking to Nina, gave him a quick glance.&nbsp; The young sub began

<P>to recover from the astonishment and confusion caused by Nina's

<P>unexpected appearance and great beauty.&nbsp; "She was very beautiful

<P>and imposing," he reflected, "but after all a half-caste girl."

<P>This thought caused him to pluck up heart and look at Nina

<P>sideways.&nbsp; Nina, with composed face, was answering in a low, even

<P>voice the elder officer's polite questions as to the country and

<P>her mode of life.&nbsp; Almayer pushed his plate away and drank his

<P>guest's wine in gloomy silence.
