<P>The bright sunshine of the clear mistless morning, after the

<P>stormy night, flooded the main path of the settlement leading

<P>from the low shore of the Pantai branch of the river to the gate

<P>of Abdulla's compound.&nbsp; The path was deserted this morning; it

<P>stretched its dark yellow surface, hard beaten by the tramp of

<P>many bare feet, between the clusters of palm trees, whose tall

<P>trunks barred it with strong black lines at irregular intervals,

<P>while the newly risen sun threw the shadows of their leafy heads

<P>far away over the roofs of the buildings lining the river, even

<P>over the river itself as it flowed swiftly and silently past the

<P>deserted houses.&nbsp; For the houses were deserted too.&nbsp; On the

<P>narrow strip of trodden grass intervening between their open

<P>doors and the road, the morning fires smouldered untended,

<P>sending thin fluted columns of smoke into the cool air, and

<P>spreading the thinnest veil of mysterious blue haze over the

<P>sunlit solitude of the settlement.&nbsp; Almayer, just out of his

<P>hammock, gazed sleepily at the unwonted appearance of Sambir,

<P>wondering vaguely at the absence of life.&nbsp; His own house was very

<P>quiet; he could not hear his wife's voice, nor the sound of

<P>Nina's footsteps in the big room, opening on the verandah, which

<P>he called his sitting-room, whenever, in the company of white

<P>men, he wished to assert his claims to the commonplace decencies

<P>of civilisation.&nbsp; Nobody ever sat there; there was nothing there

<P>to sit upon, for Mrs. Almayer in her savage moods, when excited

<P>by the reminiscences of the piratical period of her life, had

<P>torn off the curtains to make sarongs for the slave-girls, and

<P>had burnt the showy furniture piecemeal to cook the family rice.

<P>But Almayer was not thinking of his furniture now.&nbsp; He was

<P>thinking of Dain's return, of Dain's nocturnal interview with

<P>Lakamba, of its possible influence on his long-matured plans, now

<P>nearing the period of their execution.&nbsp; He was also uneasy at the

<P>non-appearance of Dain who had promised him an early visit.&nbsp; "The

<P>fellow had plenty of time to cross the river," he mused, "and

<P>there was so much to be done to-day.&nbsp; The settling of details for

<P>the early start on the morrow; the launching of the boats; the

<P>thousand and one finishing touches.&nbsp; For the expedition must

<P>start complete, nothing should be forgotten, nothing should--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sense of the unwonted solitude grew upon him suddenly, and in

<P>the unusual silence he caught himself longing even for the

<P>usually unwelcome sound of his wife's voice to break the

<P>oppressive stillness which seemed, to his frightened fancy, to

<P>portend the advent of some new misfortune.&nbsp; "What has happened?"

<P>he muttered half aloud, as he shuffled in his imperfectly

<P>adjusted slippers towards the balustrade of the verandah.&nbsp; "Is

<P>everybody asleep or dead?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The settlement was alive and very much awake.&nbsp; It was awake ever

<P>since the early break of day, when Mahmat Banjer, in a fit of

<P>unheard-of energy, arose and, taking up his hatchet, stepped over

<P>the sleeping forms of his two wives and walked shivering to the

<P>water's edge to make sure that the new house he was building had

<P>not floated away during the night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The house was being built by the enterprising Mahmat on a large

<P>raft, and he had securely moored it just inside the muddy point

<P>of land at the junction of the two branches of the Pantai so as

<P>to be out of the way of drifting logs that would no doubt strand

<P>on the point during the freshet.&nbsp; Mahmat walked through the wet

<P>grass saying bourrouh, and cursing softly to himself the hard

<P>necessities of active life that drove him from his warm couch

<P>into the cold of the morning.&nbsp; A glance showed him that his house

<P>was still there, and he congratulated himself on his foresight in

<P>hauling it out of harm's way, for the increasing light showed him

<P>a confused wrack of drift-logs, half-stranded on the muddy flat,

<P>interlocked into a shapeless raft by their branches, tossing to

<P>and fro and grinding together in the eddy caused by the meeting

<P>currents of the two branches of the river.&nbsp; Mahmat walked down
to

<P>the water's edge to examine the rattan moorings of his house just

<P>as the sun cleared the trees of the forest on the opposite shore.

<P>As he bent over the fastenings he glanced again carelessly at the

<P>unquiet jumble of logs and saw there something that caused him to

<P>drop his hatchet and stand up, shading his eyes with his hand

<P>from the rays of the rising sun.&nbsp; It was something red, and the

<P>logs rolled over it, at times closing round it, sometimes hiding

<P>it.&nbsp; It looked to him at first like a strip of red cloth.&nbsp;
The

<P>next moment Mahmat had made it out and raised a great shout.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah ya! There!" yelled Mahmat.&nbsp; "There's a man amongst the logs."

<P>He put the palms of his hand to his lips and shouted, enunciating

<P>distinctly, his face turned towards the settlement: "There's a

<P>body of a man in the river! Come and see! A dead--stranger!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The women of the nearest house were already outside kindling the

<P>fires and husking the morning rice.&nbsp; They took up the cry

<P>shrilly, and it travelled so from house to house, dying away in

<P>the distance.&nbsp; The men rushed out excited but silent, and ran

<P>towards the muddy point where the unconscious logs tossed and

<P>ground and bumped and rolled over the dead stranger with the

<P>stupid persistency of inanimate things.&nbsp; The women followed,

<P>neglecting their domestic duties and disregarding the

<P>possibilities of domestic discontent, while groups of children

<P>brought up the rear, warbling joyously, in the delight of

<P>unexpected excitement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer called aloud for his wife and daughter, but receiving no

<P>response, stood listening intently.&nbsp; The murmur of the crowd

<P>reached him faintly, bringing with it the assurance of some

<P>unusual event.&nbsp; He glanced at the river just as he was going to

<P>leave the verandah and checked himself at the sight of a small

<P>canoe crossing over from the Rajah's landing-place.&nbsp; The solitary

<P>occupant (in whom Almayer soon recognised Babalatchi) effected

<P>the crossing a little below the house and paddled up to the

<P>Lingard jetty in the dead water under the bank.&nbsp; Babalatchi

<P>clambered out slowly and went on fastening his canoe with

<P>fastidious care, as if not in a hurry to meet Almayer, whom he

<P>saw looking at him from the verandah.&nbsp; This delay gave Almayer

<P>time to notice and greatly wonder at Babalatchi's official

<P>get-up.&nbsp; The statesman of Sambir was clad in a costume befitting

<P>his high rank.&nbsp; A loudly checkered sarong encircled his waist,

<P>and from its many folds peeped out the silver hilt of the kriss

<P>that saw the light only on great festivals or during official

<P>receptions.&nbsp; Over the left shoulder and across the otherwise

<P>unclad breast of the aged diplomatist glistened a patent leather

<P>belt bearing a brass plate with the arms of Netherlands under the

<P>inscription, "Sultan of Sambir."&nbsp; Babalatchi's head was covered

<P>by a red turban, whose fringed ends falling over the left cheek

<P>and shoulder gave to his aged face a ludicrous expression of

<P>joyous recklessness.&nbsp; When the canoe was at last fastened to his

<P>satisfaction he straightened himself up, shaking down the folds

<P>of his sarong, and moved with long strides towards Almayer's

<P>house, swinging regularly his long ebony staff, whose gold head

<P>ornamented with precious stones flashed in the morning sun.

<P>Almayer waved his hand to the right towards the point of land, to

<P>him invisible, but in full view from the jetty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Babalatchi! oh!" he called out; "what is the matter there?

<P>can you see?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi stopped and gazed intently at the crowd on the river

<P>bank, and after a little while the astonished Almayer saw him

<P>leave the path, gather up his sarong in one hand, and break into

<P>a trot through the grass towards the muddy point.&nbsp; Almayer, now

<P>greatly interested, ran down the steps of the verandah.&nbsp; The

<P>murmur of men's voices and the shrill cries of women reached him

<P>quite distinctly now, and as soon as he turned the corner of his

<P>house he could see the crowd on the low promontory swaying and

<P>pushing round some object of interest.&nbsp; He could indistinctly

<P>hear Babalatchi's voice, then the crowd opened before the aged

<P>statesman and closed after him with an excited hum, ending in a

<P>loud shout.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Almayer approached the throng a man ran out and rushed past

<P>him towards the settlement, unheeding his call to stop and

<P>explain the cause of this excitement.&nbsp; On the very outskirts of

<P>the crowd Almayer found himself arrested by an unyielding mass of

<P>humanity, regardless of his entreaties for a passage, insensible

<P>to his gentle pushes as he tried to work his way through it

<P>towards the riverside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the midst of his gentle and slow progress he fancied suddenly

<P>he had heard his wife's voice in the thickest of the throng.&nbsp; He

<P>could not mistake very well Mrs. Almayer's high-pitched tones,

<P>yet the words were too indistinct for him to understand their

<P>purport.&nbsp; He paused in his endeavours to make a passage for

<P>himself, intending to get some intelligence from those around

<P>him, when a long and piercing shriek rent the air, silencing the

<P>murmurs of the crowd and the voices of his informants.&nbsp; For a

<P>moment Almayer remained as if turned into stone with astonishment

<P>and horror, for he was certain now that he had heard his wife

<P>wailing for the dead.&nbsp; He remembered Nina's unusual absence, and

<P>maddened by his apprehensions as to her safety, he pushed blindly

<P>and violently forward, the crowd falling back with cries of

<P>surprise and pain before his frantic advance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the point of land in a little clear space lay the body of the

<P>stranger just hauled out from amongst the logs.&nbsp; On one side

<P>stood Babalatchi, his chin resting on the head of his staff and

<P>his one eye gazing steadily at the shapeless mass of broken

<P>limbs, torn flesh, and bloodstained rags.&nbsp; As Almayer burst

<P>through the ring of horrified spectators, Mrs. Almayer threw her

<P>own head-veil over the upturned face of the drowned man, and,

<P>squatting by it, with another mournful howl, sent a shiver

<P>through the now silent crowd.&nbsp; Mahmat, dripping wet, turned to

<P>Almayer, eager to tell his tale.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the first moment of reaction from the anguish of his fear the

<P>sunshine seemed to waver before Almayer's eyes, and he listened

<P>to words spoken around him without comprehending their meaning.

<P>When, by a strong effort of will, he regained the possession of

<P>his senses, Mahmat was saying--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is the way, Tuan.&nbsp; His sarong was caught in the broken

<P>branch, and he hung with his head under water.&nbsp; When I saw what

<P>it was I did not want it here.&nbsp; I wanted it to get clear and

<P>drift away.&nbsp; Why should we bury a stranger in the midst of our

<P>houses for his ghost to frighten our women and children?&nbsp; Have
we

<P>not enough ghosts about this place?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A murmur of approval interrupted him here.&nbsp; Mahmat looked

<P>reproachfully at Babalatchi.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But the Tuan Babalatchi ordered me to drag the body ashore"--he

<P>went on looking round at his audience, but addressing himself

<P>only to Almayer--"and I dragged him by the feet; in through the

<P>mud I have dragged him, although my heart longed to see him float

<P>down the river to strand perchance on Bulangi's clearing--may his

<P>father's grave be defiled!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was subdued laughter at this, for the enmity of Mahmat and

<P>Bulangi was a matter of common notoriety and of undying interest

<P>to the inhabitants of Sambir.&nbsp; In the midst of that mirth Mrs.

<P>Almayer wailed suddenly again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Allah!&nbsp; What ails the woman!" exclaimed Mahmat, angrily.&nbsp;
"Here,

<P>I have touched this carcass which came from nobody knows where,

<P>and have most likely defiled myself before eating rice.&nbsp; By

<P>orders of Tuan Babalatchi I did this thing to please the white

<P>man.&nbsp; Are you pleased, O Tuan Almayer?&nbsp; And what will be my

<P>recompense?&nbsp; Tuan Babalatchi said a recompense there will be, and

<P>from you.&nbsp; Now consider.&nbsp; I have been defiled, and if not
defiled

<P>I may be under the spell.&nbsp; Look at his anklets!&nbsp; Who ever
heard

<P>of a corpse appearing during the night amongst the logs with gold

<P>anklets on its legs?&nbsp; There is witchcraft there.&nbsp; However,"
added

<P>Mahmat, after a reflective pause, "I will have the anklet if

<P>there is permission, for I have a charm against the ghosts and am

<P>not afraid.&nbsp; God is great!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A fresh outburst of noisy grief from Mrs. Almayer checked the

<P>flow of Mahmat's eloquence.&nbsp; Almayer, bewildered, looked in turn

<P>at his wife, at Mahmat, at Babalatchi, and at last arrested his

<P>fascinated gaze on the body lying on the mud with covered face in

<P>a grotesquely unnatural contortion of mangled and broken limbs,

<P>one twisted and lacerated arm, with white bones protruding in

<P>many places through the torn flesh, stretched out; the hand with

<P>outspread fingers nearly touching his foot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you know who this is?" he asked of Babalatchi, in a low

<P>voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi, staring straight before him, hardly moved his lips,

<P>while Mrs. Almayer's persistent lamentations drowned the whisper

<P>of his murmured reply intended only for Almayer's ear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was fate.&nbsp; Look at your feet, white man.&nbsp; I can see a
ring on

<P>those torn fingers which I know well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Saying this, Babalatchi stepped carelessly forward, putting his

<P>foot as if accidentally on the hand of the corpse and pressing it

<P>into the soft mud.&nbsp; He swung his staff menacingly towards the

<P>crowd, which fell back a little.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go away," he said sternly, "and send your women to their cooking

<P>fires, which they ought not to have left to run after a dead

<P>stranger.&nbsp; This is men's work here.&nbsp; I take him now in the
name

<P>of the Rajah.&nbsp; Let no man remain here but Tuan Almayer's slaves.

<P>Now go!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The crowd reluctantly began to disperse.&nbsp; The women went first,

<P>dragging away the children that hung back with all their weight

<P>on the maternal hand.&nbsp; The men strolled slowly after them in ever

<P>forming and changing groups that gradually dissolved as they

<P>neared the settlement and every man regained his own house with

<P>steps quickened by the hungry anticipation of the morning rice.

<P>Only on the slight elevation where the land sloped down towards

<P>the muddy point a few men, either friends or enemies of Mahmat,

<P>remained gazing curiously for some time longer at the small group

<P>standing around the body on the river bank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not understand what you mean, Babalatchi," said Almayer.

<P>"What is the ring you are talking about?&nbsp; Whoever he is, you have

<P>trodden the poor fellow's hand right into the mud.&nbsp; Uncover his

<P>face," he went on, addressing Mrs. Almayer, who, squatting by the

<P>head of the corpse, rocked herself to and fro, shaking from time

<P>to time her dishevelled grey locks, and muttering mournfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hai!' exclaimed Mahmat, who had lingered close by.&nbsp; "Look, Tuan;

<P>the logs came together so," and here he pressed the palms of his

<P>hands together, "and his head must have been between them, and

<P>now there is no face for you to look at.&nbsp; There are his flesh and

<P>his bones, the nose, and the lips, and maybe his eyes, but nobody

<P>could tell the one from the other.&nbsp; It was written the day he was

<P>born that no man could look at him in death and be able to say,

<P>'This is my friend's face.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Silence, Mahmat; enough!" said Babalatchi, "and take thy eyes

<P>off his anklet, thou eater of pigs flesh.&nbsp; Tuan Almayer," he went

<P>on, lowering his voice, "have you seen Dain this morning?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer opened his eyes wide and looked alarmed.&nbsp; "No," he said

<P>quickly; "haven't you seen him?&nbsp; Is he not with the Rajah?&nbsp;
I am

<P>waiting; why does he not come?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi nodded his head sadly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is come, Tuan.&nbsp; He left last night when the storm was great

<P>and the river spoke angrily.&nbsp; The night was very black, but he

<P>had within him a light that showed the way to your house as

<P>smooth as a narrow backwater, and the many logs no bigger than

<P>wisps of dried grass.&nbsp; Therefore he went; and now he lies here."

<P>And Babalatchi nodded his head towards the body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How can you tell?" said Almayer, excitedly, pushing his wife

<P>aside.&nbsp; He snatched the cover off and looked at the formless mass

<P>of flesh, hair, and drying mud, where the face of the drowned man

<P>should have been.&nbsp; "Nobody can tell," he added, turning away with

<P>a shudder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi was on his knees wiping the mud from the stiffened

<P>fingers of the outstretched hand.&nbsp; He rose to his feet and

<P>flashed before Almayer's eyes a gold ring set with a large green

<P>stone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know this well," he said.&nbsp; "This never left Dain's hand.&nbsp;
I

<P>had to tear the flesh now to get it off.&nbsp; Do you believe now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer raised his hands to his head and let them fall listlessly

<P>by his side in the utter abandonment of despair.&nbsp; Babalatchi,

<P>looking at him curiously, was astonished to see him smile.&nbsp; A

<P>strange fancy had taken possession of Almayer's brain, distracted

<P>by this new misfortune.&nbsp; It seemed to him that for many years he

<P>had been falling into a deep precipice.&nbsp; Day after day, month

<P>after month, year after year, he had been falling, falling,

<P>falling; it was a smooth, round, black thing, and the black walls

<P>had been rushing upwards with wearisome rapidity.&nbsp; A great rush,

<P>the noise of which he fancied he could hear yet; and now, with an

<P>awful shock, he had reached the bottom, and behold! he was alive

<P>and whole, and Dain was dead with all his bones broken.&nbsp; It

<P>struck him as funny.&nbsp; A dead Malay; he had seen many dead Malays

<P>without any emotion; and now he felt inclined to weep, but it was

<P>over the fate of a white man he knew; a man that fell over a deep

<P>precipice and did not die.&nbsp; He seemed somehow to himself to be

<P>standing on one side, a little way off, looking at a certain

<P>Almayer who was in great trouble.&nbsp; Poor, poor fellow! Why doesn't

<P>he cut his throat? He wished to encourage him; he was very

<P>anxious to see him lying dead over that other corpse.&nbsp; Why does

<P>he not die and end this suffering? He groaned aloud unconsciously

<P>and started with affright at the sound of his own voice.&nbsp; Was he

<P>going mad? Terrified by the thought he turned away and ran

<P>towards his house repeating to himself, I am not going mad; of

<P>course not, no, no, no! He tried to keep a firm hold of the idea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Not mad, not mad.&nbsp; He stumbled as he ran blindly up the steps

<P>repeating fast and ever faster those words wherein seemed to lie

<P>his salvation.&nbsp; He saw Nina standing there, and wished to say

<P>something to her, but could not remember what, in his extreme

<P>anxiety not to forget that he was not going mad, which he still

<P>kept repeating mentally as he ran round the table, till he

<P>stumbled against one of the arm-chairs and dropped into it

<P>exhausted.&nbsp; He sat staring wildly at Nina, still assuring himself

<P>mentally of his own sanity and wondering why the girl shrank from

<P>him in open-eyed alarm.&nbsp; What was the matter with her?&nbsp; This
was

<P>foolish.&nbsp; He struck the table violently with his clenched fist

<P>and shouted hoarsely, "Give me some gin!&nbsp; Run!"&nbsp; Then, while
Nina

<P>ran off, he remained in the chair, very still and quiet,

<P>astonished at the noise he had made.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina returned with a tumbler half filled with gin, and found her

<P>father staring absently before him.&nbsp; Almayer felt very tired now,

<P>as if he had come from a long journey.&nbsp; He felt as if he had

<P>walked miles and miles that morning and now wanted to rest very

<P>much.&nbsp; He took the tumbler with a shaking hand, and as he drank

<P>his teeth chattered against the glass which he drained and set

<P>down heavily on the table.&nbsp; He turned his eyes slowly towards

<P>Nina standing beside him, and said steadily--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now all is over, Nina.&nbsp; He is dead, and I may as well burn all

<P>my boats."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He felt very proud of being able to speak so calmly.&nbsp; Decidedly

<P>he was not going mad.&nbsp; This certitude was very comforting, and
he

<P>went on talking about the finding of the body, listening to his

<P>own voice complacently.&nbsp; Nina stood quietly, her hand resting

<P>lightly on her father's shoulder, her face unmoved, but every

<P>line of her features, the attitude of her whole body expressing

<P>the most keen and anxious attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And so Dain is dead," she said coldly, when her father ceased

<P>speaking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer's elaborately calm demeanour gave way in a moment to an

<P>outburst of violent indignation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You stand there as if you were only half alive, and talk to me,"

<P>he exclaimed angrily, "as if it was a matter of no importance.

<P>Yes, he is dead!&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; Dead!&nbsp; What do
you care?

<P>You never cared; you saw me struggle, and work, and strive,

<P>unmoved; and my suffering you could never see.&nbsp; No, never.&nbsp;
You

<P>have no heart, and you have no mind, or you would have understood

<P>that it was for you, for your happiness I was working.&nbsp; I wanted

<P>to be rich; I wanted to get away from here.&nbsp; I wanted to see

<P>white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your

<P>wealth.&nbsp; Old as I am I wished to seek a strange land, a

<P>civilisation to which I am a stranger, so as to find a new life

<P>in the contemplation of your high fortunes, of your triumphs, of

<P>your happiness.&nbsp; For that I bore patiently the burden of work,
of

<P>disappointment, of humiliation amongst these savages here, and I

<P>had it all nearly in my grasp."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked at his daughter's attentive face and jumped to his feet

<P>upsetting the chair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you hear? I had it all there; so; within reach of my hand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused, trying to keep down his rising anger, and failed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you no feeling?" he went on.&nbsp; "Have you lived without

<P>hope?"&nbsp; Nina's silence exasperated him; his voice rose, although

<P>he tried to master his feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are you content to live in this misery and die in this wretched

<P>hole?&nbsp; Say something, Nina; have you no sympathy?&nbsp; Have you
no

<P>word of comfort for me?&nbsp; I that loved you so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He waited for a while for an answer, and receiving none shook his

<P>fist in his daughter's face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe you are an idiot!" he yelled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked round for the chair, picked it up and sat down stiffly.

<P>His anger was dead within him, and he felt ashamed of his

<P>outburst, yet relieved to think that now he had laid clear before

<P>his daughter the inner meaning of his life.&nbsp; He thought so in

<P>perfect good faith, deceived by the emotional estimate of his

<P>motives, unable to see the crookedness of his ways, the unreality

<P>of his aims, the futility of his regrets.&nbsp; And now his heart was

<P>filled only with a great tenderness and love for his daughter.

<P>He wanted to see her miserable, and to share with her his

<P>despair; but he wanted it only as all weak natures long for a

<P>companionship in misfortune with beings innocent of its cause.

<P>If she suffered herself she would understand and pity him; but

<P>now she would not, or could not, find one word of comfort or love

<P>for him in his dire extremity.&nbsp; The sense of his absolute

<P>loneliness came home to his heart with a force that made him

<P>shudder.&nbsp; He swayed and fell forward with his face on the table,

<P>his arms stretched straight out, extended and rigid.&nbsp; Nina made
a

<P>quick movement towards her father and stood looking at the grey

<P>head, on the broad shoulders shaken convulsively by the violence

<P>of feelings that found relief at last in sobs and tears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina sighed deeply and moved away from the table.&nbsp; Her features

<P>lost the appearance of stony indifference that had exasperated

<P>her father into his outburst of anger and sorrow.&nbsp; The expression

<P>of her face, now unseen by her father, underwent a rapid change.

<P>She had listened to Almayer's appeal for sympathy, for one word

<P>of comfort, apparently indifferent, yet with her breast torn by

<P>conflicting impulses raised unexpectedly by events she had not

<P>foreseen, or at least did not expect to happen so soon.&nbsp; With her

<P>heart deeply moved by the sight of Almayer's misery, knowing it

<P>in her power to end it with a word, longing to bring peace to

<P>that troubled heart, she heard with terror the voice of her

<P>overpowering love commanding her to be silent.&nbsp; And she submitted

<P>after a short and fierce struggle of her old self against the new

<P>principle of her life.&nbsp; She wrapped herself up in absolute

<P>silence, the only safeguard against some fatal admission.&nbsp; She

<P>could not trust herself to make a sign, to murmur a word for fear

<P>of saying too much; and the very violence of the feelings that

<P>stirred the innermost recesses of her soul seemed to turn her

<P>person into a stone.&nbsp; The dilated nostrils and the flashing eyes

<P>were the only signs of the storm raging within, and those signs

<P>of his daughter's emotion Almayer did not see, for his sight was

<P>dimmed by self-pity, by anger, and by despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Had Almayer looked at his daughter as she leant over the front

<P>rail of the verandah he could have seen the expression of

<P>indifference give way to a look of pain, and that again pass

<P>away, leaving the glorious beauty of her face marred by

<P>deep-drawn lines of watchful anxiety.&nbsp; The long grass in the

<P>neglected courtyard stood very straight before her eyes in the

<P>noonday heat.&nbsp; From the river-bank there were voices and a

<P>shuffle of bare feet approaching the house; Babalatchi could be

<P>heard giving directions to Almayer's men, and Mrs. Almayer's

<P>subdued wailing became audible as the small procession bearing

<P>the body of the drowned man and headed by that sorrowful matron

<P>turned the corner of the house.&nbsp; Babalatchi had taken the broken

<P>anklet off the man's leg, and now held it in his hand as he moved

<P>by the side of the bearers, while Mahmat lingered behind timidly,

<P>in the hopes of the promised reward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lay him there," said Babalatchi to Almayer's men, pointing to a

<P>pile of drying planks in front of the verandah.&nbsp; "Lay him there.

<P>He was a Kaffir and the son of a dog, and he was the white man's

<P>friend.&nbsp; He drank the white man's strong water," he added, with

<P>affected horror.&nbsp; "That I have seen myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men stretched out the broken limbs on two planks they had

<P>laid level, while Mrs. Almayer covered the body with a piece of

<P>white cotton cloth, and after whispering for some time with

<P>Babalatchi departed to her domestic duties.&nbsp; Almayer's men, after

<P>laying down their burden, dispersed themselves in quest of shady

<P>spots wherein to idle the day away.&nbsp; Babalatchi was left alone
by

<P>the corpse that laid rigid under the white cloth in the bright

<P>sunshine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina came down the steps and joined Babalatchi, who put his hand

<P>to his forehead, and squatted down with great deference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have a bangle there," said Nina, looking down on

<P>Babalatchi's upturned face and into his solitary eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have, Mem Putih," returned the polite statesman.&nbsp; Then turning

<P>towards Mahmat he beckoned him closer, calling out, "Come here!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mahmat approached with some hesitation.&nbsp; He avoided looking at

<P>Nina, but fixed his eyes on Babalatchi.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, listen," said Babalatchi, sharply.&nbsp; "The ring and the

<P>anklet you have seen, and you know they belonged to Dain the

<P>trader, and to no other.&nbsp; Dain returned last night in a canoe.

<P>He spoke with the Rajah, and in the middle of the night left to

<P>cross over to the white man's house.&nbsp; There was a great flood,

<P>and this morning you found him in the river."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By his feet I dragged him out," muttered Mahmat under his

<P>breath.&nbsp; "Tuan Babalatchi, there will be a recompense!" he

<P>exclaimed aloud.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi held up the gold bangle before Mahmat's eyes.&nbsp; "What
I

<P>have told you, Mahmat, is for all ears.&nbsp; What I give you now is

<P>for your eyes only.&nbsp; Take."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mahmat took the bangle eagerly and hid it in the folds of his

<P>waist-cloth.&nbsp; "Am I a fool to show this thing in a house with

<P>three women in it?" he growled.&nbsp; "But I shall tell them about

<P>Dain the trader, and there will be talk enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned and went away, increasing his pace as soon as he was

<P>outside Almayer's compound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi looked after him till he disappeared behind the

<P>bushes.&nbsp; "Have I done well, Mem Putih?" he asked, humbly

<P>addressing Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have," answered Nina.&nbsp; "The ring you may keep yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi touched his lips and forehead, and scrambled to his

<P>feet.&nbsp; He looked at Nina, as if expecting her to say something

<P>more, but Nina turned towards the house and went up the steps,

<P>motioning him away with her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi picked up his staff and prepared to go.&nbsp; It was very

<P>warm, and he did not care for the long pull to the Rajah's house.

<P>Yet he must go and tell the Rajah--tell of the event; of the

<P>change in his plans; of all his suspicions.&nbsp; He walked to the

<P>jetty and began casting off the rattan painter of his canoe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The broad expanse of the lower reach, with its shimmering surface

<P>dotted by the black specks of the fishing canoes, lay before his

<P>eyes.&nbsp; The fishermen seemed to be racing.&nbsp; Babalatchi paused
in

<P>his work, and looked on with sudden interest.&nbsp; The man in the

<P>foremost canoe, now within hail of the first houses of Sambir,

<P>laid in his paddle and stood up shouting--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The boats! the boats! The man-of-war's boats are coming!&nbsp; They

<P>are here!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a moment the settlement was again alive with people rushing to

<P>the riverside.&nbsp; The men began to unfasten their boats, the women

<P>stood in groups looking towards the bend down the river.&nbsp; Above

<P>the trees lining the reach a slight puff of smoke appeared like a

<P>black stain on the brilliant blue of the cloudless sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi stood perplexed, the painter in his hand.&nbsp; He looked

<P>down the reach, then up towards Almayer's house, and back again

<P>at the river as if undecided what to do.&nbsp; At last he made the

<P>canoe fast again hastily, and ran towards the house and up the

<P>steps of the verandah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tuan! Tuan!" he called, eagerly.&nbsp; "The boats are coming.&nbsp;
The

<P>man-of-war's boats.&nbsp; You had better get ready.&nbsp; The officers
will

<P>come here, I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer lifted his head slowly from the table, and looked at him

<P>stupidly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mem Putih!" exclaimed Babalatchi to Nina, "look at him.&nbsp; He does

<P>not hear.&nbsp; You must take care," he added meaningly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina nodded to him with an uncertain smile, and was going to

<P>speak, when a sharp report from the gun mounted in the bow of the

<P>steam launch that was just then coming into view arrested the

<P>words on her parted lips.&nbsp; The smile died out, and was replaced

<P>by the old look of anxious attention.&nbsp; From the hills far away

<P>the echo came back like a long-drawn and mournful sigh, as if the

<P>land had sent it in answer to the voice of its masters.
