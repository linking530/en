<P>"Kaspar! Makan!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The well-known shrill voice startled Almayer from his dream of

<P>splendid future into the unpleasant realities of the present

<P>hour.&nbsp; An unpleasant voice too.&nbsp; He had heard it for many
years,

<P>and with every year he liked it less.&nbsp; No matter; there would be

<P>an end to all this soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shuffled uneasily, but took no further notice of the call.

<P>Leaning with both his elbows on the balustrade of the verandah,

<P>he went on looking fixedly at the great river that flowed--

<P>indifferent and hurried--before his eyes.&nbsp; He liked to look at
it

<P>about the time of sunset; perhaps because at that time the

<P>sinking sun would spread a glowing gold tinge on the waters of

<P>the Pantai, and Almayer's thoughts were often busy with gold;

<P>gold he had failed to secure; gold the others had secured--

<P>dishonestly, of course--or gold he meant to secure yet, through

<P>his own honest exertions, for himself and Nina.&nbsp; He absorbed

<P>himself in his dream of wealth and power away from this&nbsp; coast

<P>where he had dwelt for so many years, forgetting the bitterness

<P>of toil and strife in the vision of a great and splendid reward.

<P>They would live in Europe, he and his daughter.&nbsp; They would be

<P>rich and respected.&nbsp; Nobody would think of her mixed blood in the

<P>presence of her great beauty and of his immense wealth.

<P>Witnessing her triumphs he would grow young again, he would

<P>forget the twenty-five years of heart-breaking struggle on this

<P>coast where he felt like a prisoner.&nbsp; All this was nearly within

<P>his reach.&nbsp; Let only Dain return!&nbsp; And return soon he must--in

<P>his own interest, for his own share.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; now more than
a

<P>week late!&nbsp; Perhaps he would return to-night. Such were Almayer's

<P>thoughts as, standing on the verandah of his new but already

<P>decaying house--that last failure of his life-- he looked on the

<P>broad river.&nbsp; There was no tinge of gold on it this evening, for

<P>it had been swollen by the rains, and rolled an angry and muddy

<P>flood under his inattentive eyes, carrying small drift-wood and

<P>big dead logs, and whole uprooted trees with branches and

<P>foliage, amongst which the water swirled and roared angrily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of those drifting trees grounded on the shelving shore, just

<P>by the house, and Almayer, neglecting his dream, watched it with

<P>languid interest.&nbsp; The tree swung slowly round, amid the hiss and

<P>foam of the water, and soon getting free of the obstruction began

<P>to move down stream again, rolling slowly over, raising upwards a

<P>long, denuded branch, like a hand lifted in mute appeal to heaven

<P>against the river's brutal and unnecessary violence.&nbsp; Almayer's

<P>interest in the fate of that tree increased rapidly.&nbsp; He leaned

<P>over to see if it would clear the low point below.&nbsp; It did; then

<P>he drew back, thinking that now its course was free down to the

<P>sea, and he envied the lot of that inanimate thing now growing

<P>small and indistinct in the deepening darkness.&nbsp; As he lost sight

<P>of it altogether he began to wonder how far out to sea it would

<P>drift.&nbsp; Would the current carry it north or south?&nbsp; South,

<P>probably, till it drifted in sight of Celebes, as far as

<P>Macassar, perhaps!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Macassar!&nbsp; Almayer's quickened fancy distanced the tree on its

<P>imaginary voyage, but his memory lagging behind some twenty years

<P>or more in point of time saw a young and slim Almayer, clad all

<P>in white and modest-looking, landing from the Dutch mail-boat on

<P>the dusty jetty of Macassar, coming to woo fortune in the godowns

<P>of old Hudig.&nbsp; It was an important epoch in his life, the

<P>beginning of a new existence for him.&nbsp; His father, a subordinate

<P>official employed in the Botanical Gardens of Buitenzorg, was no

<P>doubt delighted to place his son in such a firm.&nbsp; The young man

<P>himself too was nothing loth to leave the poisonous shores of

<P>Java, and the meagre comforts of the parental bungalow, where the

<P>father grumbled all day at the stupidity of native gardeners, and

<P>the mother from the depths of her long easy-chair bewailed the

<P>lost glories of Amsterdam, where she had been brought up, and of

<P>her position as the daughter of a cigar dealer there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer had left his home with a light heart and a lighter

<P>pocket, speaking English well, and strong in arithmetic; ready to

<P>conquer the world, never doubting that he would.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After those twenty years, standing in the close and stifling heat

<P>of a Bornean evening, he recalled with pleasurable regret the

<P>image of Hudig's lofty and cool warehouses with their long and

<P>straight avenues of gin cases and bales of Manchester goods; the

<P>big door swinging noiselessly; the dim light of the place, so

<P>delightful after the glare of the streets; the little railed-off

<P>spaces amongst piles of merchandise where the Chinese clerks,

<P>neat, cool, and sad-eyed, wrote rapidly and in silence amidst the

<P>din of the working gangs rolling casks or shifting cases to a

<P>muttered song, ending with a desperate yell.&nbsp; At the upper end,

<P>facing the great door, there was a larger space railed off, well

<P>lighted; there the noise was subdued by distance, and above it

<P>rose the soft and continuous clink of silver guilders which other

<P>discreet Chinamen were counting and piling up under the

<P>supervision of Mr. Vinck, the cashier, the genius presiding&nbsp; in

<P>the place--the right hand of the Master.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In that clear space Almayer worked at his table not far from a

<P>little green painted door, by which always stood a Malay in a red

<P>sash and turban, and whose hand, holding a small string dangling

<P>from above, moved up and down with the regularity of a machine.

<P>The string worked a punkah on the other side of the green door,

<P>where the so-called private office was, and where old Hudig--the

<P>Master--sat enthroned, holding noisy receptions.&nbsp; Sometimes the

<P>little door would fly open disclosing to the outer world, through

<P>the bluish haze of tobacco smoke, a long table loaded with

<P>bottles of various shapes and tall water-pitchers, rattan

<P>easy-chairs occupied by noisy men in sprawling attitudes, while

<P>the Master would put his head through and, holding by the handle,

<P>would grunt confidentially to Vinck; perhaps send an order

<P>thundering down the warehouse, or spy a hesitating stranger and

<P>greet him with a friendly roar, "Welgome, Gapitan! ver' you gome

<P>vrom?&nbsp; Bali, eh?&nbsp; Got bonies?&nbsp; I vant bonies!&nbsp; Vant
all you got;

<P>ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Gome in!"&nbsp; Then the stranger was dragged in,
in a

<P>tempest of yells, the door was shut, and the usual noises

<P>refilled the place; the song of the workmen, the rumble of

<P>barrels, the scratch of rapid pens; while above all rose the

<P>musical chink of broad silver pieces streaming ceaselessly

<P>through the yellow fingers of the attentive Chinamen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At that time Macassar was teeming with life and commerce.&nbsp; It was

<P>the point in the islands where tended all those bold spirits who,

<P>fitting out schooners on the Australian coast, invaded the Malay

<P>Archipelago in search of money and adventure.&nbsp; Bold, reckless,

<P>keen in business, not disinclined for a brush with the pirates

<P>that were to be found on many a coast as yet, making money fast,

<P>they used to have a general "rendezvous" in the bay for purposes

<P>of trade and dissipation.&nbsp; The Dutch merchants called those men

<P>English pedlars; some of them were undoubtedly gentlemen for whom

<P>that kind of life had a charm; most were seamen; the acknowledged

<P>king of them all was Tom Lingard, he whom the Malays, honest or

<P>dishonest, quiet fishermen or desperate cut-throats, recognised

<P>as "the Rajah-Laut"--the King of the Sea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer had heard of him before he had been three days in

<P>Macassar, had heard the stories of his smart business

<P>transactions, his loves, and also of his desperate fights with

<P>the Sulu pirates, together with the romantic tale of some child--

<P>a girl--found in a piratical prau by the victorious Lingard,

<P>when, after a long contest, he boarded the craft, driving the

<P>crew overboard.&nbsp; This girl, it was generally known, Lingard had

<P>adopted, was having her educated in some convent in Java,&nbsp; and

<P>spoke of her as "my daughter."&nbsp; He had sworn a mighty oath to

<P>marry her to a white man before he went home and to leave her all

<P>his money.&nbsp; "And Captain Lingard has lots of money," would say

<P>Mr. Vinck solemnly, with his head on one side, "lots of money;

<P>more than Hudig!"&nbsp; And after a pause--just to let his hearers

<P>recover from their astonishment at such an incredible assertion--

<P>he would add in an explanatory whisper, "You know, he has

<P>discovered a river."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That was it!&nbsp; He had discovered a river!&nbsp; That was the fact

<P>placing old Lingard so much above the common crowd of sea-going

<P>adventurers who traded with Hudig in the daytime and drank

<P>champagne, gambled, sang noisy songs, and made love to half-caste

<P>girls under the broad verandah of the Sunda Hotel at night.&nbsp; Into

<P>that river, whose entrances himself only knew, Lingard used to

<P>take his assorted cargo of Manchester goods, brass gongs, rifles

<P>and gunpowder.&nbsp; His brig Flash, which he commanded himself, would

<P>on those occasions disappear quietly during the night from the

<P>roadstead while his companions were sleeping off the effects of

<P>the midnight carouse, Lingard seeing them drunk under the table

<P>before going on board, himself unaffected by any amount of

<P>liquor.&nbsp; Many tried to follow him and find that land of plenty

<P>for gutta-percha and rattans, pearl shells and birds' nests,&nbsp; wax

<P>and gum-dammar, but the little Flash could outsail every craft in

<P>those seas.&nbsp; A few of them came to grief on hidden sandbanks and

<P>coral reefs, losing their all and barely escaping with life from

<P>the cruel grip of this sunny and smiling sea; others got

<P>discouraged; and for many years the green and peaceful-looking

<P>islands guarding the entrances to the promised land kept their

<P>secret with all the merciless serenity of tropical nature.&nbsp; And

<P>so Lingard came and went on his secret or open expeditions,

<P>becoming a hero in Almayer's eyes by the boldness and enormous

<P>profits of his ventures, seeming to&nbsp; Almayer a very great man

<P>indeed as he saw him marching up the&nbsp; warehouse, grunting a "how

<P>are you?" to Vinck, or greeting Hudig, the Master, with a

<P>boisterous "Hallo, old pirate!&nbsp; Alive yet?" as a preliminary to

<P>transacting business behind the little green door.&nbsp; Often of an

<P>evening, in the silence of the then deserted warehouse, Almayer

<P>putting away his papers before driving home with Mr. Vinck, in

<P>whose household he lived, would pause listening to the noise of a

<P>hot discussion in the private office, would hear the deep and

<P>monotonous growl of the Master, and the roared-out interruptions

<P>of Lingard--two mastiffs fighting over a marrowy bone.&nbsp; But to

<P>Almayer's ears it sounded like a quarrel of Titans--a battle of

<P>the gods.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a year or so Lingard, having been brought often in contact

<P>with Almayer in the course of business, took a sudden and, to the

<P>onlookers, a rather inexplicable fancy to the young man.&nbsp; He sang

<P>his praises, late at night, over a convivial glass to his cronies

<P>in the Sunda Hotel, and one fine morning electrified Vinck by

<P>declaring that he must have "that young fellow for a supercargo.

<P>Kind of captain's clerk.&nbsp; Do all my quill-driving for me."&nbsp;
Hudig

<P>consented.&nbsp; Almayer, with youth's natural craving for change, was

<P>nothing loth, and packing his few belongings, started in the

<P>Flash on one of those long cruises when the old seaman was wont

<P>to visit almost every island in the archipelago.&nbsp; Months slipped

<P>by, and Lingard's friendship seemed to increase.&nbsp; Often pacing

<P>the deck with Almayer, when the faint night breeze, heavy with

<P>aromatic exhalations of the islands, shoved the brig gently along

<P>under the peaceful and sparkling sky, did the old seaman open his

<P>heart to his entranced listener.&nbsp; He spoke of his past life, of

<P>escaped dangers, of big profits in his trade, of new combinations

<P>that were in the future to bring profits bigger still.&nbsp; Often he

<P>had mentioned his daughter, the girl found in the pirate prau,

<P>speaking of her with a strange assumption of fatherly tenderness.

<P>"She must be a big girl now," he used to say.&nbsp; "It's nigh unto

<P>four years since I have seen her!&nbsp; Damme, Almayer, if I don't

<P>think we will run into Sourabaya this trip."&nbsp; And after such a

<P>declaration he always dived into his cabin muttering to himself,

<P>"Something must be done--must be done."&nbsp; More than once he would

<P>astonish Almayer by walking up to him rapidly, clearing his

<P>throat with a powerful "Hem!" as if he was going to say

<P>something, and then turning abruptly away to lean over the

<P>bulwarks in silence, and watch, motionless, for hours, the gleam

<P>and sparkle of the phosphorescent sea along the ship's side.&nbsp; It

<P>was the night before arriving in Sourabaya when one of those

<P>attempts at confidential communication succeeded.&nbsp; After clearing

<P>his throat he spoke.&nbsp; He spoke to some purpose.&nbsp; He wanted

<P>Almayer to marry his adopted daughter.&nbsp; "And don't you kick

<P>because you're white!" he shouted, suddenly, not giving the

<P>surprised young man the time to say a word.&nbsp; "None of that with

<P>me!&nbsp; Nobody will see the colour of your wife's skin.&nbsp; The
dollars

<P>are too thick for that, I tell you!&nbsp; And mind you, they will be

<P>thicker yet before I die.&nbsp; There will be millions, Kaspar!

<P>Millions I say!&nbsp; And all for her--and for you, if you do what you

<P>are told."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Startled by the unexpected proposal, Almayer hesitated, and

<P>remained silent for a minute.&nbsp; He was gifted with a strong and

<P>active imagination, and in that short space of time he saw, as in

<P>a flash of dazzling light, great piles of shining guilders, and

<P>realised all the possibilities of an opulent existence.&nbsp; The

<P>consideration, the indolent ease of life--for which he felt

<P>himself so well fitted--his ships, his warehouses, his

<P>merchandise (old Lingard would not live for ever), and, crowning

<P>all, in the far future gleamed like a fairy palace the big

<P>mansion in Amsterdam, that earthly paradise of his dreams, where,

<P>made king amongst men by old Lingard's money, he would pass the

<P>evening of his days in inexpressible splendour.&nbsp; As to the&nbsp;
other

<P>side of the picture--the companionship for life of a Malay girl,

<P>that legacy of a boatful of pirates--there was only within him a

<P>confused consciousness of shame that he a white man-- Still, a

<P>convent education of four years!--and then she may mercifully

<P>die.&nbsp; He was always lucky, and money is powerful!&nbsp; Go through
it.

<P>Why not?&nbsp; He had a vague idea of shutting her up somewhere,

<P>anywhere, out of his gorgeous future.&nbsp; Easy enough to dispose of

<P>a Malay woman, a slave, after all, to his Eastern mind, convent

<P>or no convent, ceremony or no ceremony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He lifted his head and confronted the anxious yet irate seaman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I--of course--anything you wish, Captain Lingard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Call me father, my boy.&nbsp; She does," said the mollified old

<P>adventurer.&nbsp; "Damme, though, if I didn't think you were going to

<P>refuse.&nbsp; Mind you, Kaspar, I always get my way, so it would have

<P>been no use.&nbsp; But you are no fool."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He remembered well that time--the look, the accent, the words,

<P>the effect they produced on him, his very surroundings.&nbsp; He

<P>remembered the narrow slanting deck of the brig, the silent

<P>sleeping coast, the smooth black surface of the sea with a great

<P>bar of gold laid on it by the rising moon.&nbsp; He remembered it all,

<P>and he remembered his feelings of mad exultation at the thought

<P>of that fortune thrown into his hands.&nbsp; He was no fool then, and

<P>he was no fool now.&nbsp; Circumstances had been against him; the

<P>fortune was gone, but hope remained.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shivered in the night air, and suddenly became aware of the

<P>intense darkness which, on the sun's departure, had closed in

<P>upon the river, blotting out the outlines of the opposite shore.

<P>Only the fire of dry branches lit outside the stockade of the

<P>Rajah's compound called fitfully into view the ragged trunks of

<P>the surrounding trees, putting a stain of glowing red half-way

<P>across the river where the drifting logs were hurrying towards

<P>the sea through the impenetrable gloom.&nbsp; He had a hazy

<P>recollection of having been called some time during the&nbsp; evening

<P>by his wife.&nbsp; To his dinner probably.&nbsp; But a man busy

<P>contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes

<P>cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready.&nbsp; Time he went home,

<P>though; it was getting late.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stepped cautiously on the loose planks towards the ladder.&nbsp;
A

<P>lizard, disturbed by the noise, emitted a plaintive note and

<P>scurried through the long grass growing on the bank.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>descended the ladder carefully, now thoroughly recalled to the

<P>realities of life by the care necessary to prevent a fall on the

<P>uneven ground where the stones, decaying planks, and half-sawn

<P>beams were piled up in inextricable confusion.&nbsp; As he turned

<P>towards the house where he lived--"my old house" he called it--

<P>his ear detected the splash of paddles away in the darkness of

<P>the river.&nbsp; He stood still in the path, attentive and surprised

<P>at anybody being on the river at this late hour during such a

<P>heavy freshet.&nbsp; Now he could hear the paddles distinctly, and

<P>even a rapidly exchanged word in low tones, the heavy breathing

<P>of men fighting with the current, and hugging the bank on which

<P>he stood.&nbsp; Quite close, too, but it was too dark to distinguish

<P>anything under the overhanging bushes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Arabs, no doubt," muttered Almayer to himself, peering into the

<P>solid blackness.&nbsp; "What are they up to now?&nbsp; Some of Abdulla's

<P>business; curse him!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The boat was very close now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, ya!&nbsp; Man!" hailed Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sound of voices ceased, but the paddles worked as furiously

<P>as before.&nbsp; Then the bush in front of Almayer shook, and the

<P>sharp sound of the paddles falling into the canoe rang in the

<P>quiet night.&nbsp; They were holding on to the bush now; but Almayer

<P>could hardly make out an indistinct dark shape of a man's head

<P>and shoulders above the bank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You Abdulla?" said Almayer, doubtfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A grave voice answered--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tuan Almayer is speaking to a friend.&nbsp; There is no Arab here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer's heart gave a great leap.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dain!" he exclaimed.&nbsp; "At last! at last!&nbsp; I have been waiting

<P>for you every day and every night.&nbsp; I had nearly given you up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing could have stopped me from coming back here," said the

<P>other, almost violently.&nbsp; "Not even death," he whispered to

<P>himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is a friend's talk, and is very good," said Almayer,

<P>heartily.&nbsp; "But you are too far here.&nbsp; Drop down to the jetty
and

<P>let your men cook their rice in my campong while we talk in the

<P>house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no answer to that invitation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is it?" asked Almayer, uneasily.&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong

<P>with the brig, I hope?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The brig is where no Orang Blanda can lay his hands on her,"

<P>said Dain, with a gloomy tone in his voice, which Almayer, in his

<P>elation, failed to notice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Right," he said.&nbsp; "But where are all your men?&nbsp; There are
only

<P>two with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Listen, Tuan Almayer," said Dain.&nbsp; "To-morrow's sun shall see
me

<P>in your house, and then we will talk.&nbsp; Now I must go to the

<P>Rajah."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To the Rajah!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; What do you want with Lakamba?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tuan, to-morrow we talk like friends.&nbsp; I must see Lakamba

<P>to-night."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dain, you are not going to abandon me now, when all is ready?"

<P>asked Almayer, in a pleading voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have I not returned?&nbsp; But I must see Lakamba first for your good

<P>and mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The shadowy head disappeared abruptly.&nbsp; The bush, released from

<P>the grasp of the bowman, sprung back with a swish, scattering a

<P>shower of muddy water over Almayer, as he bent forward, trying to

<P>see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a little while the canoe shot into the streak of light that

<P>streamed on the river from the big fire on the opposite shore,

<P>disclosing the outline of two men bending to their work, and a

<P>third figure in the stern flourishing the steering paddle, his

<P>head covered with an enormous round hat, like a fantastically

<P>exaggerated mushroom.

<P>Almayer watched the canoe till it passed out of the line of

<P>light.&nbsp; Shortly after the murmur of many voices reached him

<P>across the water.&nbsp; He could see the torches being snatched out
of

<P>the burning pile, and rendering visible for a moment the gate in

<P>the stockade round which they crowded.&nbsp; Then they went in

<P>apparently.&nbsp; The torches disappeared, and the scattered fire sent

<P>out only a dim and fitful glare.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer stepped homewards with long strides and mind uneasy.

<P>Surely Dain was not thinking of playing him false.&nbsp; It was

<P>absurd.&nbsp; Dain and Lakamba were both too much interested in the

<P>success of his scheme.&nbsp; Trusting to Malays was poor work; but

<P>then even Malays have some sense and understand their own

<P>interest.&nbsp; All would be well--must be well.&nbsp; At this point
in his

<P>meditation he found himself at the foot of the steps leading to

<P>the verandah of his home.&nbsp; From the low point of land where he

<P>stood he could see both branches of the river.&nbsp; The main branch

<P>of the Pantai was lost in complete darkness, for the fire at the

<P>Rajah's had gone out altogether; but up the Sambir reach his eye

<P>could follow the long line of Malay houses crowding the bank,

<P>with here and there a dim light twinkling through bamboo walls,

<P>or a smoky torch burning on the platforms built out over the

<P>river.&nbsp; Further away, where the island ended in a low cliff, rose

<P>a dark mass of buildings towering above the Malay structures.

<P>Founded solidly on a firm ground with plenty of space, starred by

<P>many lights burning strong and white, with a suggestion of

<P>paraffin and lamp-glasses, stood the house and the godowns of

<P>Abdulla bin Selim, the great trader of Sambir.&nbsp; To Almayer the

<P>sight was very distasteful, and he shook his fist towards the

<P>buildings that in their evident prosperity looked to him cold and

<P>insolent, and contemptuous of his own fallen fortunes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He mounted the steps of his house slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the middle of the verandah there was a round table.&nbsp; On it a

<P>paraffin lamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three

<P>inner sides.&nbsp; The fourth side was open, and faced the river.

<P>Between the rough supports of the high-pitched roof hung torn

<P>rattan screens.&nbsp; There was no ceiling, and the harsh brilliance

<P>of the lamp was toned above into a soft half-light that lost

<P>itself in the obscurity amongst the rafters.&nbsp; The front wall was

<P>cut in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red

<P>curtain.&nbsp; The women's room opened into that passage, which led
to

<P>the back courtyard and to the cooking shed.&nbsp; In one of the side

<P>walls there was a doorway.&nbsp; Half obliterated words--"Office:

<P>Lingard and Co."--were still legible on the dusty door, which

<P>looked as if it had not been opened for a very long time.&nbsp; Close

<P>to the other side wall stood a bent-wood rocking-chair, and by

<P>the table and about the verandah four wooden armchairs straggled

<P>forlornly, as if ashamed of their shabby surroundings.&nbsp; A heap
of

<P>common mats lay in one corner, with an old hammock slung

<P>diagonally above.&nbsp; In the other corner, his head wrapped in a

<P>piece of red calico, huddled into a shapeless heap, slept a

<P>Malay, one of Almayer's domestic slaves--"my own people," he used

<P>to call them.&nbsp; A numerous and representative assembly of moths

<P>were holding high revels round the lamp to the spirited music of

<P>swarming mosquitoes.&nbsp; Under the palm-leaf thatch lizards raced
on

<P>the beams calling softly.&nbsp; A monkey, chained to one of the

<P>verandah supports--retired for the night under the eaves-- peered

<P>and grinned at Almayer, as it swung to one of the bamboo roof

<P>sticks and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried&nbsp; leaves to

<P>settle on the shabby table.&nbsp; The floor was uneven, with many

<P>withered plants and dried earth scattered about.&nbsp; A general air

<P>of squalid neglect pervaded the place.&nbsp; Great red stains on the

<P>floor and walls testified to frequent and indiscriminate

<P>betel-nut chewing.&nbsp; The light breeze from the river swayed gently

<P>the tattered blinds, sending from the woods opposite a faint and

<P>sickly perfume as of decaying flowers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Under Almayer's heavy tread the boards of the verandah creaked

<P>loudly.&nbsp; The sleeper in the corner moved uneasily, muttering

<P>indistinct words.&nbsp; There was a slight rustle behind the curtained

<P>doorway, and a soft voice asked in Malay, "Is it you, father?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Nina.&nbsp; I am hungry.&nbsp; Is everybody asleep in this house?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer spoke jovially and dropped with a contented sigh into the

<P>armchair nearest to the table.&nbsp; Nina Almayer came through the

<P>curtained doorway followed by an old Malay woman, who busied

<P>herself in setting upon the table a plateful of rice and fish, a

<P>jar of water, and a bottle half full of genever.&nbsp; After carefully

<P>placing before her master a cracked glass tumbler and a tin spoon

<P>she went away noiselessly.&nbsp; Nina stood by the table, one hand

<P>lightly resting on its edge, the other hanging listlessly by her

<P>side.&nbsp; Her face turned towards the outer darkness, through which

<P>her dreamy eyes seemed to see some entrancing picture, wore a

<P>look of impatient expectancy.&nbsp; She was tall for a half-caste,

<P>with the correct profile of the father, modified and strengthened

<P>by the squareness of the lower part of the face inherited from

<P>her maternal ancestors--the Sulu pirates.&nbsp; Her firm mouth, with

<P>the lips slightly parted and disclosing a gleam of white teeth,

<P>put a vague suggestion of ferocity into the impatient&nbsp; expression

<P>of her features.&nbsp; And yet her dark and perfect eyes had all the

<P>tender softness of expression common to Malay women, but with a

<P>gleam of superior intelligence; they looked gravely, wide open

<P>and steady, as if facing something invisible to all other eyes,

<P>while she stood there all in white, straight, flexible, graceful,

<P>unconscious of herself, her low but broad forehead crowned with a

<P>shining mass of long black hair that fell in heavy tresses over

<P>her shoulders, and made her pale olive complexion look paler

<P>still by the contrast of its coal-black hue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer attacked his rice greedily, but after a few mouthfuls he

<P>paused, spoon in hand, and looked at his daughter curiously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you hear a boat pass about half an hour ago Nina?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl gave him a quick glance, and moving away from the light

<P>stood with her back to the table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," she said, slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There was a boat.&nbsp; At last!&nbsp; Dain himself; and he went on
to

<P>Lakamba.&nbsp; I know it, for he told me so.&nbsp; I spoke to him, but
he

<P>would not come here to-night.&nbsp; Will come to-morrow, he said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He swallowed another spoonful, then said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am almost happy to-night, Nina.&nbsp; I can see the end of a long

<P>road, and it leads us away from this miserable swamp.&nbsp; We shall

<P>soon get away from here, I and you, my dear little girl, and then

<P>--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He rose from the table and stood looking fixedly before him as if

<P>contemplating some enchanting vision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then," he went on, "we shall be happy, you and I.&nbsp; Live rich

<P>and respected far from here, and forget this life, and all this

<P>struggle, and all this misery!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He approached his daughter and passed his hand caressingly over

<P>her hair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is bad to have to trust a Malay," he said, "but I must own

<P>that this Dain is a perfect gentleman--a perfect gentleman," he

<P>repeated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you ask him to come here, father?" inquired Nina, not

<P>looking at him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, of course.&nbsp; We shall start on the day after to-morrow,"

<P>said Almayer, joyously.&nbsp; "We must not lose any time.&nbsp; Are
you

<P>glad, little girl?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was nearly as tall as himself, but he liked to recall the

<P>time when she was little and they were all in all to each other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad," she said, very low.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course," said Almayer, vivaciously, "you cannot imagine what

<P>is before you.&nbsp; I myself have not been to Europe, but I have

<P>heard my mother talk so often that I seem to know all about it.

<P>We shall live a--a glorious life.&nbsp; You shall see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again he stood silent by his daughter's side looking at that

<P>enchanting vision.&nbsp; After a while he shook his clenched hand

<P>towards the sleeping settlement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! my friend Abdulla," he cried, "we shall see who will have

<P>the best of it after all these years!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked up the river and remarked calmly:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Another thunderstorm.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; No thunder will keep me awake

<P>to-night, I know!&nbsp; Good-night, little girl," he whispered,

<P>tenderly kissing her cheek.&nbsp; "You do not seem to be very happy

<P>to-night, but to-morrow you will show a brighter face.&nbsp; Eh?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina had listened to her father with her face unmoved, with her

<P>half-closed eyes still gazing into the night now made more

<P>intense by a heavy thunder-cloud that had crept down from the

<P>hills blotting out the stars, merging sky, forest, and river into

<P>one mass of almost palpable blackness.&nbsp; The faint breeze had died

<P>out, but the distant rumble of thunder and pale flashes of

<P>lightning gave warning of the approaching storm.&nbsp; With a sigh the

<P>girl turned towards the table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer was in his hammock now, already half asleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take the lamp, Nina," he muttered, drowsily.&nbsp; "This place is

<P>full of mosquitoes.&nbsp; Go to sleep, daughter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Nina put the lamp out and turned back again towards the

<P>balustrade of the verandah, standing with her arm round the

<P>wooden support and looking eagerly towards the Pantai reach.&nbsp; And

<P>motionless there in the oppressive calm of the tropical night she

<P>could see at each flash of lightning the forest lining both banks

<P>up the river, bending before the furious blast of the coming

<P>tempest, the upper reach of the river whipped into white foam by

<P>the wind, and the black clouds torn into fantastic shapes

<P>trailing low over the swaying trees.&nbsp; Round her all was as yet

<P>stillness and peace, but she could hear afar off the roar of the

<P>wind, the hiss of heavy rain, the wash of the waves on the

<P>tormented river.&nbsp; It came nearer and nearer, with loud

<P>thunder-claps and long flashes of vivid lightning, followed by

<P>short periods of appalling blackness.&nbsp; When the storm reached the

<P>low point dividing the river, the house shook in the wind, and

<P>the rain pattered loudly on the palm-leaf roof, the thunder spoke

<P>in one prolonged roll, and the incessant lightning disclosed a

<P>turmoil of leaping waters, driving logs, and the big trees

<P>bending before a brutal and merciless force.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Undisturbed by the nightly event of the rainy monsoon, the father

<P>slept quietly, oblivious alike of his hopes, his misfortunes, his

<P>friends, and his enemies; and the daughter stood motionless, at

<P>each flash of lightning eagerly scanning the broad river with a

<P>steady and anxious gaze.
