<P>When, in compliance with Lingard's abrupt demand, Almayer

<P>consented to wed the Malay girl, no one knew that on the day when

<P>the interesting young convert had lost all her natural relations

<P>and found a white father, she had been fighting desperately like

<P>the rest of them on board the prau, and was only prevented from

<P>leaping overboard, like the few other survivors, by a severe

<P>wound in the leg.&nbsp; There, on the fore-deck of the prau, old

<P>Lingard found her under a heap of dead and dying pirates, and had

<P>her carried on the poop of the Flash before the Malay craft was

<P>set on fire and sent adrift.&nbsp; She was conscious, and in the great

<P>peace and stillness of the tropical evening succeeding the

<P>turmoil of the battle, she watched all she held dear on earth

<P>after her own savage manner, drift away into the gloom in a great

<P>roar of flame and smoke.&nbsp; She lay there unheeding the careful

<P>hands attending to her wound, silent and absorbed in gazing at

<P>the funeral pile of those brave men she had so much admired and

<P>so well helped in their contest with the redoubtable

<P>"Rajah-Laut."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The light night breeze fanned the brig gently to the southward,

<P>and the great blaze of light got smaller and smaller till it

<P>twinkled only on the horizon like a setting star.&nbsp; It set:&nbsp;
the

<P>heavy canopy of smoke reflected the glare of hidden flames for a

<P>short time and then disappeared also.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She realised that with this vanishing gleam her old life departed

<P>too.&nbsp; Thenceforth there was slavery in the far countries, amongst

<P>strangers, in unknown and perhaps terrible surroundings.&nbsp; Being

<P>fourteen years old, she realised her position and came to that

<P>conclusion, the only one possible to a Malay girl, soon ripened

<P>under a tropical sun, and not unaware of her personal charms, of

<P>which she heard many a young brave warrior of her father's crew

<P>express an appreciative admiration.&nbsp; There was in her the dread

<P>of the unknown; otherwise she accepted her position calmly, after

<P>the manner of her people, and even considered it quite natural;

<P>for was she not a daughter of warriors, conquered in battle, and

<P>did she not belong rightfully to the victorious Rajah?&nbsp; Even the

<P>evident kindness of the terrible old man must spring, she

<P>thought, from admiration for his captive, and the flattered

<P>vanity eased for her the pangs of sorrow after such an awful

<P>calamity.&nbsp; Perhaps had she known of the high walls, the quiet

<P>gardens, and the silent nuns of the Samarang convent, where her

<P>destiny was leading her, she would have sought death in her dread

<P>and hate of such a restraint.&nbsp; But in imagination she pictured
to

<P>herself the usual life of a Malay girl--the usual succession of

<P>heavy work and fierce love, of intrigues, gold ornaments, of

<P>domestic drudgery, and of that great but occult influence which

<P>is one of the few rights of half-savage womankind.&nbsp; But her

<P>destiny in the rough hands of the old sea-dog, acting under

<P>unreasoning impulses of the heart, took a strange and to her a

<P>terrible shape.&nbsp; She bore it all--the restraint and the teaching

<P>and the new faith--with calm submission, concealing her hate&nbsp; and

<P>contempt for all that new life.&nbsp; She learned the language very

<P>easily, yet understood but little of the new faith the good

<P>sisters taught her, assimilating quickly only the superstitious

<P>elements of the religion.&nbsp; She called Lingard father, gently and

<P>caressingly, at each of his short and noisy visits, under the

<P>clear impression that he was a great and dangerous power it was

<P>good to propitiate.&nbsp; Was he not now her master?&nbsp; And during
those

<P>long four years she nourished a hope of finding favour in his

<P>eyes and ultimately becoming his wife, counsellor, and guide.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Those dreams of the future were dispelled by the Rajah Laut's

<P>"fiat," which made Almayer's fortune, as that young man fondly

<P>hoped.&nbsp; And dressed in the hateful finery of Europe, the centre

<P>of an interested circle of Batavian society, the young convert

<P>stood before the altar with an unknown and sulky-looking white

<P>man.&nbsp; For Almayer was uneasy, a little disgusted, and greatly

<P>inclined to run away.&nbsp; A judicious fear of the adopted

<P>father-in-law and a just regard for his own material welfare

<P>prevented him from making a scandal; yet, while swearing

<P>fidelity, he was concocting plans for getting rid of the&nbsp; pretty

<P>Malay girl in a more or less distant future.&nbsp; She, however, had

<P>retained enough of conventual teaching to understand well that

<P>according to white men's laws she was going to be Almayer's

<P>companion and not his slave, and promised to herself to act

<P>accordingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So when the Flash freighted with materials for building a new

<P>house left the harbour of Batavia, taking away the young couple

<P>into the unknown Borneo, she did not carry on her deck so much

<P>love and happiness as old Lingard was wont to boast of before his

<P>casual friends in the verandahs of various hotels.&nbsp; The old

<P>seaman himself was perfectly happy.&nbsp; Now he had done his duty by

<P>the girl.&nbsp; "You know I made her an orphan," he often concluded

<P>solemnly, when talking about his own affairs to a scratch

<P>audience of shore loafers--as it was his habit to do.&nbsp; And the

<P>approbative shouts of his half-intoxicated auditors filled his

<P>simple soul with delight and pride.&nbsp; "I carry everything right

<P>through," was another of his sayings, and in pursuance of that

<P>principle he pushed the building of house and godowns on the

<P>Pantai River with feverish haste.&nbsp; The house for the young

<P>couple; the godowns for the big trade Almayer was going to

<P>develop while he (Lingard) would be able to give himself up to

<P>some mysterious work which was only spoken of in hints, but was

<P>understood to relate to gold and diamonds in the interior of the

<P>island.&nbsp; Almayer was impatient too.&nbsp; Had he known what was
before

<P>him he might not have been so eager and full of hope as he stood

<P>watching the last canoe of the Lingard expedition disappear in

<P>the bend up the river.&nbsp; When, turning round, he beheld the pretty

<P>little house, the big godowns built neatly by an army of Chinese

<P>carpenters, the new jetty round which were clustered the trading

<P>canoes, he felt a sudden elation in the thought that the world

<P>was his.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the world had to be conquered first, and its conquest was not

<P>so easy as he thought.&nbsp; He was very soon made to understand that

<P>he was not wanted in that corner of it where old Lingard and his

<P>own weak will placed him, in the midst of unscrupulous intrigues

<P>and of a fierce trade competition.&nbsp; The Arabs had found out the

<P>river, had established a trading post in Sambir, and where they

<P>traded they would be masters and suffer no rival.&nbsp; Lingard

<P>returned unsuccessful from his first expedition, and departed

<P>again spending all the profits of the legitimate trade on his

<P>mysterious journeys.&nbsp; Almayer struggled with the difficulties of

<P>his position, friendless and unaided, save for the protection

<P>given to him for Lingard's sake by the old Rajah, the predecessor

<P>of Lakamba.&nbsp; Lakamba himself, then living as a private individual

<P>on a rice clearing, seven miles down the river, exercised all his

<P>influence towards the help of the white man's enemies, plotting

<P>against the old Rajah and Almayer with a certainty of

<P>combination, pointing clearly to a profound knowledge of their

<P>most secret affairs.&nbsp; Outwardly friendly, his portly form was

<P>often to be seen on Almayer's verandah; his green turban and

<P>gold-embroidered jacket shone in the front rank of the decorous

<P>throng of Malays coming to greet Lingard on his returns from the

<P>interior; his salaams were of the lowest, and his hand-shakings

<P>of the heartiest, when welcoming the old trader.&nbsp; But his small

<P>eyes took in the signs of the times, and he departed from those

<P>interviews with a satisfied and furtive smile to hold long

<P>consultations with his friend and ally, Syed Abdulla, the&nbsp; chief

<P>of the Arab trading post, a man of great wealth and of great

<P>influence in the islands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was currently believed at that time in the settlement that

<P>Lakamba's visits to Almayer's house were not limited to those

<P>official interviews.&nbsp; Often on moonlight nights the belated

<P>fishermen of Sambira saw a small canoe shooting out from the

<P>narrow creek at the back of the white man's house, and the

<P>solitary occupant paddle cautiously down the river in the deep

<P>shadows of the bank; and those events, duly reported, were

<P>discussed round the evening fires far into the night with the

<P>cynicism of expression common to aristocratic Malays, and with a

<P>malicious pleasure in the domestic misfortunes of the Orang

<P>Blando--the hated Dutchman.&nbsp; Almayer went on struggling

<P>desperately, but with a feebleness of purpose depriving him of

<P>all chance of success against men so unscrupulous and resolute as

<P>his rivals the Arabs.&nbsp; The trade fell away from the large

<P>godowns, and the godowns themselves rotted piecemeal.&nbsp; The old

<P>man's banker, Hudig of Macassar, failed, and with this went the

<P>whole available capital.&nbsp; The profits of past years had been

<P>swallowed up in Lingard's exploring craze.&nbsp; Lingard was in the

<P>interior--perhaps dead--at all events giving no sign of life.

<P>Almayer stood alone in the midst of those adverse circumstances,

<P>deriving only a little comfort from the companionship of his

<P>little daughter, born two years after the marriage, and at the

<P>time some six years old.&nbsp; His wife had soon commenced to treat

<P>him with a savage contempt expressed by sulky silence, only

<P>occasionally varied by a flood of savage invective.&nbsp; He felt she

<P>hated him, and saw her jealous eyes watching himself and the

<P>child with almost an expression of hate.&nbsp; She was jealous of the

<P>little girl's evident preference for the father, and Almayer felt

<P>he was not safe with that woman in the house.&nbsp; While she was

<P>burning the furniture, and tearing down the pretty curtains in

<P>her unreasoning hate of those signs of civilisation, Almayer,

<P>cowed by these outbursts of savage nature, meditated in silence

<P>on the best way of getting rid of her.&nbsp; He thought of everything;

<P>even planned murder in an undecided and feeble sort of way, but

<P>dared do nothing--expecting every day the return of Lingard with

<P>news of some immense good fortune.&nbsp; He returned indeed, but aged,

<P>ill, a ghost of his former self, with the fire of fever burning

<P>in his sunken eyes, almost the only survivor of the numerous

<P>expedition.&nbsp; But he was successful at last!&nbsp; Untold riches
were

<P>in his grasp; he wanted more money--only a little more torealise

<P>a dream of fabulous fortune.&nbsp; And Hudig had failed!&nbsp; Almayer

<P>scraped all he could together, but the old man wanted more.&nbsp; If

<P>Almayer could not get it he would go to Singapore--to Europe

<P>even, but before all to Singapore; and he would take the little

<P>Nina with him.&nbsp; The child must be brought up decently.&nbsp; He
had

<P>good friends in Singapore who would take care of her and have her

<P>taught properly.&nbsp; All would be well, and that girl, upon whom the

<P>old seaman seemed to have transferred all his former affection

<P>for the mother, would be the richest woman in the East--in the

<P>world even.&nbsp; So old Lingard shouted, pacing the verandah with his

<P>heavy quarter-deck step, gesticulating with a smouldering

<P>cheroot; ragged, dishevelled, enthusiastic; and Almayer, sitting

<P>huddled up on a pile of mats, thought with dread of the

<P>separation with the only human being he loved--with greater dread

<P>still, perhaps, of the scene with his wife, the savage tigress

<P>deprived of her young.&nbsp; She will poison me, thought the poor

<P>wretch, well aware of that easy and final manner of solving&nbsp; the

<P>social, political, or family problems in Malay life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To his great surprise she took the news very quietly, giving only

<P>him and Lingard a furtive glance, and saying not a word.&nbsp; This,

<P>however, did not prevent her the next day from jumping into the

<P>river and swimming after the boat in which Lingard was carrying

<P>away the nurse with the screaming child.&nbsp; Almayer had to give

<P>chase with his whale-boat and drag her in by the hair in the

<P>midst of cries and curses enough to make heaven fall.&nbsp; Yet after

<P>two days spent in wailing, she returned to her former mode of

<P>life, chewing betel-nut, and sitting all day amongst her women in

<P>stupefied idleness.&nbsp; She aged very rapidly after that, and only

<P>roused herself from her apathy to acknowledge by a scathing

<P>remark or an insulting exclamation the accidental presence of her

<P>husband.&nbsp; He had built for her a riverside hut in the compound

<P>where she dwelt in perfect seclusion.&nbsp; Lakamba's visits had

<P>ceased when, by a convenient decree of Providence and the help of

<P>a little scientific manipulation, the old ruler of Sambir

<P>departed this life.&nbsp; Lakamba reigned in his stead now, having

<P>been well served by his Arab friends with the Dutch authorities.

<P>Syed Abdulla was the great man and trader of the Pantai.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>lay ruined and helpless under the close-meshed net of their

<P>intrigues, owing his life only to his supposed knowledge of

<P>Lingard's valuable secret.&nbsp; Lingard had disappeared.&nbsp; He wrote

<P>once from Singapore saying the child was well, and under the care

<P>of a Mrs. Vinck, and that he himself was going to Europe to raise

<P>money for the great enterprise.&nbsp; "He was coming back soon.&nbsp;
There

<P>would be no difficulties," he wrote; "people would rush in with

<P>their money."&nbsp; Evidently they did not, for there was only one

<P>letter more from him saying he was ill, had found no relation

<P>living, but little else besides.&nbsp; Then came a complete silence.

<P>Europe had swallowed up the Rajah Laut apparently, and Almayer

<P>looked vainly westward for a ray of light out of the gloom of

<P>his shattered hopes.&nbsp; Years passed, and the rare letters from

<P>Mrs. Vinck, later on from the girl herself, were the only thing

<P>to be looked to to make life bearable amongst the triumphant

<P>savagery of the river.&nbsp; Almayer lived now alone, having even

<P>ceased to visit his debtors who would not pay, sure of Lakamba's

<P>protection.&nbsp; The faithful Sumatrese Ali cooked his rice and made

<P>his coffee, for he dared not trust any one else, and least of all

<P>his wife.&nbsp; He killed time wandering sadly in the overgrown paths

<P>round the house, visiting the ruined godowns where a few brass

<P>guns covered with verdigris and only a few broken cases of

<P>mouldering Manchester goods reminded him of the good early times

<P>when all this was full of life and merchandise, and he overlooked

<P>a busy scene on the river bank, his little daughter by his side.

<P>Now the up-country canoes glided past the little rotten wharf of

<P>Lingard and Co., to paddle up the Pantai branch, and cluster

<P>round the new jetty belonging to Abdulla.&nbsp; Not that they loved

<P>Abdulla, but they dared not trade with the man whose star had

<P>set.&nbsp; Had they done so they knew there was no mercy to be

<P>expected from Arab or Rajah; no rice to be got on credit in the

<P>times of scarcity from either; and Almayer could not help them,

<P>having at times hardly enough for himself.&nbsp; Almayer, in his

<P>isolation and despair, often envied his near neighbour the

<P>Chinaman, Jim-Eng, whom he could see stretched on a pile of cool

<P>mats, a wooden pillow under his head, an opium pipe in his

<P>nerveless fingers.&nbsp; He did not seek, however, consolation in

<P>opium--perhaps it was too expensive--perhaps his white man's

<P>pride saved him from that degradation; but most likely it was the

<P>thought of his little daughter in the far-off Straits

<P>Settlements.&nbsp; He heard from her oftener since Abdulla bought a

<P>steamer, which ran now between Singapore and the Pantai

<P>settlement every three months or so.&nbsp; Almayer felt himself nearer

<P>his daughter.&nbsp; He longed to see her, and planned a voyage to

<P>Singapore, but put off his departure from year to year, always

<P>expecting some favourable turn of fortune.&nbsp; He did not want to

<P>meet her with empty hands and with no words of hope on his lips.

<P>He could not take her back into that savage life to which he was

<P>condemned himself.&nbsp; He was also a little afraid of her.&nbsp; What

<P>would she think of him?&nbsp; He reckoned the years.&nbsp; A grown woman.

<P>A civilised woman, young and hopeful; while he felt old and

<P>hopeless, and very much like those savages round him.&nbsp; He asked

<P>himself what was going to be her future.&nbsp; He could not answer

<P>that question yet, and he dared not face her.&nbsp; And yet he longed

<P>after her.&nbsp; He hesitated for years.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His hesitation was put an end to by Nina's unexpected appearance

<P>in Sambir.&nbsp; She arrived in the steamer under the captain's care.

<P>Almayer beheld her with surprise not unmixed with wonder.&nbsp; During

<P>those ten years the child had changed into a woman, black-haired,

<P>olive-skinned, tall, and beautiful, with great sad eyes, where

<P>the startled expression common to Malay womankind was modified by

<P>a thoughtful tinge inherited from her European ancestry.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>thought with dismay of the meeting of his wife and daughter, of

<P>what this grave girl in European clothes would think of her

<P>betel-nut chewing mother, squatting in a dark hut, disorderly,

<P>half naked, and sulky.&nbsp; He also feared an outbreak of temper on

<P>the part of that pest of a woman he had hitherto managed to keep

<P>tolerably quiet, thereby saving the remnants of his dilapidated

<P>furniture.&nbsp; And he stood there before the closed door of the hut

<P>in the blazing sunshine listening to the murmur of voices,

<P>wondering what went on inside, wherefrom all the servant-maids

<P>had been expelled at the beginning of the interview, and now

<P>stood clustered by the palings with half-covered faces in a

<P>chatter of curious speculation.&nbsp; He forgot himself there trying

<P>to catch a stray word through the bamboo walls, till the captain

<P>of the steamer, who had walked up with the girl, fearing a

<P>sunstroke, took him under the arm and led him into the shade of

<P>his own verandah:&nbsp; where Nina's trunk stood already, having been

<P>landed by the steamer's men.&nbsp; As soon as Captain Ford had his

<P>glass before him and his cheroot lighted, Almayer asked for the

<P>explanation of his daughter's unexpected arrival.&nbsp; Ford said

<P>little beyond generalising in vague but violent terms upon the

<P>foolishness of women in general, and of Mrs. Vinck in particular.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know, Kaspar," said he, in conclusion, to the excited

<P>Almayer, "it is deucedly awkward to have a half-caste girl in the

<P>house.&nbsp; There's such a lot of fools about.&nbsp; There was that
young

<P>fellow from the bank who used to ride to the Vinck bungalow early

<P>and late.&nbsp; That old woman thought it was for that Emma of hers.

<P>When she found out what he wanted exactly, there was a row, I can

<P>tell you.&nbsp; She would not have Nina--not an hour longer--in the

<P>house.&nbsp; Fact is, I heard of this affair and took the girl to my

<P>wife.&nbsp; My wife is a pretty good woman--as women go--and upon my

<P>word we would have kept the girl for you, only she would not

<P>stay.&nbsp; Now, then!&nbsp; Don't flare up, Kaspar.&nbsp; Sit still.&nbsp;
What can

<P>you do?&nbsp; It is better so.&nbsp; Let her stay with you.&nbsp; She
was never

<P>happy over there.&nbsp; Those two Vinck girls are no better than

<P>dressed-up monkeys.&nbsp; They slighted her.&nbsp; You can't make her

<P>white.&nbsp; It's no use you swearing at me.&nbsp; You can't.&nbsp;
She is a

<P>good girl for all that, but she would not tell my wife anything.

<P>If you want to know, ask her yourself; but if I was you I would

<P>leave her alone.&nbsp; You are welcome to her passage money, old

<P>fellow, if you are short now."&nbsp; And the skipper, throwing away

<P>his cigar, walked off to "wake them up on board," as he expressed

<P>it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer vainly expected to hear of the cause of his daughter's

<P>return from his daughter's lips.&nbsp; Not that day, not on any other

<P>day did she ever allude to her Singapore life.&nbsp; He did not care

<P>to ask, awed by the calm impassiveness of her face, by those

<P>solemn eyes looking past him on the great, still forests sleeping

<P>in majestic repose to the murmur of the broad river.&nbsp; He accepted

<P>the situation, happy in the gentle and protecting affection the

<P>girl showed him, fitfully enough, for she had, as she called it,

<P>her bad days when she used to visit her mother and remain long

<P>hours in the riverside hut, coming out as inscrutable as ever,

<P>but with a contemptuous look and a short word ready to answer any

<P>of his speeches.&nbsp; He got used even to that, and on those days

<P>kept quiet, although greatly alarmed by his wife's influence upon

<P>the girl.&nbsp; Otherwise Nina adapted herself wonderfully to the

<P>circumstances of a half-savage and miserable life.&nbsp; She accepted

<P>without question or apparent disgust the neglect, the decay,&nbsp; the

<P>poverty of the household, the absence of furniture, and the

<P>preponderance of rice diet on the family table.&nbsp; She lived with

<P>Almayer in the little house (now sadly decaying) built originally

<P>by Lingard for the young couple.&nbsp; The Malays eagerly discussed

<P>her arrival.&nbsp; There were at the beginning crowded levees of Malay

<P>women with their children, seeking eagerly after "Ubat" for all

<P>the ills of the flesh from the young Mem Putih.&nbsp; In the cool of

<P>the evening grave Arabs in long white shirts and yellow

<P>sleeveless jackets walked slowly on the dusty path by the

<P>riverside towards Almayer's gate, and made solemn calls upon that

<P>Unbeliever under shallow pretences of business, only to get a

<P>glimpse of the young girl in a highly decorous manner.&nbsp; Even

<P>Lakamba came out of his stockade in a great pomp of war canoes

<P>and red umbrellas, and landed on the rotten little jetty of

<P>Lingard and Co.&nbsp; He came, he said, to buy a couple of brass guns

<P>as a present to his friend the chief of Sambir Dyaks; and while

<P>Almayer, suspicious but polite, busied himself in unearthing the

<P>old popguns in the godowns, the Rajah sat on an armchair in the

<P>verandah, surrounded by his respectful retinue waiting in vain

<P>for Nina's appearance.&nbsp; She was in one of her bad days, and

<P>remained in her mother's hut watching with her the ceremonious

<P>proceedings on the verandah.&nbsp; The Rajah departed, baffled but

<P>courteous, and soon Almayer began to reap the benefit of

<P>improved relations with the ruler in the shape of the recovery of

<P>some debts, paid to him with many apologies and many a low salaam

<P>by debtors till then considered hopelessly insolvent.&nbsp; Under

<P>these improving circumstances Almayer brightened up a little.

<P>All was not lost perhaps.&nbsp; Those Arabs and Malays saw at last

<P>that he was a man of some ability, he thought.&nbsp; And he began,

<P>after his manner, to plan great things, to dream of great

<P>fortunes for himself and Nina.&nbsp; Especially for Nina!&nbsp; Under
these

<P>vivifying impulses he asked Captain Ford to write to his friends

<P>in England making inquiries after Lingard.&nbsp; Was he alive or dead?

<P>If dead, had he left any papers, documents; any indications or

<P>hints as to his great enterprise?&nbsp; Meantime he had found amongst

<P>the rubbish in one of the empty rooms a note-book belonging to

<P>the old adventurer.&nbsp; He studied the crabbed handwriting of its

<P>pages and often grew meditative over it.&nbsp; Other things also woke

<P>him up from his apathy.&nbsp; The stir made in the whole of the island

<P>by the establishment of the British Borneo Company affected even

<P>the sluggish flow of the Pantai life.&nbsp; Great changes were

<P>expected; annexation was talked of; the Arabs grew civil.

<P>Almayer began building his new house for the use of the future

<P>engineers, agents, or settlers of the new Company.&nbsp; He spent

<P>every available guilder on it with a confiding heart.&nbsp; One thing

<P>only disturbed his happiness:&nbsp; his wife came out of her

<P>seclusion, importing her green jacket, scant sarongs, shrill

<P>voice, and witch-like appearance, into his quiet life in the

<P>small bungalow.&nbsp; And his daughter seemed to accept that savage

<P>intrusion into their daily existence with wonderful equanimity.

<P>He did not like it, but dared say nothing.
