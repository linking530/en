<P>In the middle of a shadowless square of moonlight, shining on a

<P>smooth and level expanse of young rice-shoots, a little

<P>shelter-hut perched on high posts, the pile of brushwood near by

<P>and the glowing embers of a fire with a man stretched before it,

<P>seemed very small and as if lost in the pale green iridescence

<P>reflected from the ground.&nbsp; On three sides of the clearing,

<P>appearing very far away in the deceptive light, the big trees of

<P>the forest, lashed together with manifold bonds by a mass of

<P>tangled creepers, looked down at the growing young life at their

<P>feet with the sombre resignation of giants that had lost faith in

<P>their strength.&nbsp; And in the midst of them the merciless creepers

<P>clung to the big trunks in cable-like coils, leaped from tree to

<P>tree, hung in thorny festoons from the lower boughs, and, sending

<P>slender tendrils on high to seek out the smallest branches,

<P>carried death to their victims in an exulting riot of silent

<P>destruction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the fourth side, following the curve of the bank of that

<P>branch of the Pantai that formed the only access to the clearing,

<P>ran a black line of young trees, bushes, and thick second growth,

<P>unbroken save for a small gap chopped out in one place.&nbsp; At that

<P>gap began the narrow footpath leading from the water's edge to

<P>the grass-built shelter used by the night watchers when the

<P>ripening crop had to be protected from the wild pigs.&nbsp; The

<P>pathway ended at the foot of the piles on which the hut was

<P>built, in a circular space covered with ashes and bits of burnt

<P>wood.&nbsp; In the middle of that space, by the dim fire, lay Dain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned over on his side with an impatient sigh, and, pillowing

<P>his head on his bent arm, lay quietly with his face to the dying

<P>fire.&nbsp; The glowing embers shone redly in a small circle, throwing

<P>a gleam into his wide-open eyes, and at every deep breath the

<P>fine white ash of bygone fires rose in a light cloud before his

<P>parted lips, and danced away from the warm glow into the

<P>moonbeams pouring down upon Bulangi's clearing.&nbsp; His body was

<P>weary with the exertion of the past few days, his mind more weary

<P>still with the strain of solitary waiting for his fate.&nbsp; Never

<P>before had he felt so helpless.&nbsp; He had heard the report of the

<P>gun fired on board the launch, and he knew that his life was in

<P>untrustworthy hands, and that his enemies were very near.&nbsp; During

<P>the slow hours of the afternoon he roamed about on the edge of

<P>the forest, or, hiding in the bushes, watched the creek with

<P>unquiet eyes for some sign of danger.&nbsp; He feared not death, yet

<P>he desired ardently to live, for life to him was Nina.&nbsp; She had

<P>promised to come, to follow him, to share his danger and his

<P>splendour.&nbsp; But with her by his side he cared not for danger, and

<P>without her there could be no splendour and no joy in existence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crouching in his shady hiding-place, he closed his eyes, trying

<P>to evoke the gracious and charming image of the white figure that

<P>for him was the beginning and the end of life.&nbsp; With eyes shut

<P>tight, his teeth hard set, he tried in a great effort of

<P>passionate will to keep his hold on that vision of supreme

<P>delight.&nbsp; In vain!&nbsp; His heart grew heavy as the figure of
Nina

<P>faded away to be replaced by another vision this time--a vision

<P>of armed men, of angry faces, of glittering arms--and he seemed

<P>to hear the hum of excited and triumphant voices as they

<P>discovered him in his hiding-place.&nbsp; Startled by the vividness
of

<P>his fancy, he would open his eyes, and, leaping out into the

<P>sunlight, resume his aimless wanderings around the clearing.&nbsp; As

<P>he skirted in his weary march the edge of the forest he glanced

<P>now and then into its dark shade, so enticing in its deceptive

<P>appearance of coolness, so repellent with its unrelieved gloom,

<P>where lay, entombed and rotting, countless generations of trees,

<P>and where their successors stood as if mourning, in dark green

<P>foliage, immense and helpless, awaiting their turn.&nbsp; Only the

<P>parasites seemed to live there in a sinuous rush upwards into the

<P>air and sunshine, feeding on the dead and the dying alike, and

<P>crowning their victims with pink and blue flowers that gleamed

<P>amongst the boughs, incongruous and cruel, like a strident and

<P>mocking note in the solemn harmony of the doomed trees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A man could hide there, thought Dain, as he approached a place

<P>where the creepers had been torn and hacked into an archway that

<P>might have been the beginning of a path.&nbsp; As he bent down to look

<P>through he heard angry grunting, and a sounder of wild pig

<P>crashed away in the undergrowth.&nbsp; An acrid smell of damp earth

<P>and of decaying leaves took him by the throat, and he drew back

<P>with a scared face, as if he had been touched by the breath of

<P>Death itself.&nbsp; The very air seemed dead in there--heavy and

<P>stagnating, poisoned with the corruption of countless ages.&nbsp; He

<P>went on, staggering on his way, urged by the nervous restlessness

<P>that made him feel tired yet caused him to loathe the very idea

<P>of immobility and repose.&nbsp; Was he a wild man to hide in the woods

<P>and perhaps be killed there--in the darkness--where there was no

<P>room to breathe?&nbsp; He would wait for his enemies in the sunlight,

<P>where he could see the sky and feel the breeze.&nbsp; He knew how a

<P>Malay chief should die.&nbsp; The sombre and desperate fury, that

<P>peculiar inheritance of his race, took possession of him, and he

<P>glared savagely across the clearing towards the gap in the bushes

<P>by the riverside.&nbsp; They would come from there.&nbsp; In imagination
he

<P>saw them now.&nbsp; He saw the bearded faces and the white jackets of

<P>the officers, the light on the levelled barrels of the rifles.

<P>What is the bravery of the greatest warrior before the firearms

<P>in the hand of a slave?&nbsp; He would walk toward them with a smiling

<P>face, with his hands held out in a sign of submission till he was

<P>very near them.&nbsp; He would speak friendly words--come nearer

<P>yet--yet nearer--so near that they could touch him with their

<P>hands and stretch them out to make him a captive.&nbsp; That would be

<P>the time:&nbsp; with a shout and a leap he would be in the midst of

<P>them, kriss in hand, killing, killing, killing, and would die

<P>with the shouts of his enemies in his ears, their warm blood

<P>spurting before his eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Carried away by his excitement, he snatched the kriss hidden in

<P>his sarong, and, drawing a long breath, rushed forward, struck at

<P>the empty air, and fell on his face.&nbsp; He lay as if stunned in the

<P>sudden reaction from his exaltation, thinking that, even if he

<P>died thus gloriously, it would have to be before he saw Nina.

<P>Better so.&nbsp; If he saw her again he felt that death would be too

<P>terrible.&nbsp; With horror he, the descendant of Rajahs and of

<P>conquerors, had to face the doubt of his own bravery.&nbsp; His desire

<P>of life tormented him in a paroxysm of agonising remorse.&nbsp; He had

<P>not the courage to stir a limb.&nbsp; He had lost faith in himself,

<P>and there was nothing else in him of what makes a man.&nbsp; The

<P>suffering remained, for it is ordered that it should abide in the

<P>human body even to the last breath, and fear remained.&nbsp; Dimly he

<P>could look into the depths of his passionate love, see its

<P>strength and its weakness, and felt afraid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sun went down slowly.&nbsp; The shadow of the western forest

<P>marched over the clearing, covered the man's scorched shoulders

<P>with its cool mantle, and went on hurriedly to mingle with the

<P>shadows of other forests on the eastern side.&nbsp; The sun lingered

<P>for a while amongst the light tracery of the higher branches, as

<P>if in friendly reluctance to abandon the body stretched in the

<P>green paddy-field.&nbsp; Then Dain, revived by the cool of the evening

<P>breeze, sat up and stared round him.&nbsp; As he did so the sun dipped

<P>sharply, as if ashamed of being detected in a sympathising

<P>attitude, and the clearing, which during the day was all light,

<P>became suddenly all darkness, where the fire gleamed like an eye.

<P>Dain walked slowly towards the creek, and, divesting himself of

<P>his torn sarong, his only garment, entered the water cautiously.

<P>He had had nothing to eat that day, and had not dared show

<P>himself in daylight by the water-side to drink.&nbsp; Now, as he swam

<P>silently, he swallowed a few mouthfuls of water that lapped about

<P>his lips.&nbsp; This did him good, and he walked with greater

<P>confidence in himself and others as he returned towards the fire.

<P>Had he been betrayed by Lakamba all would have been over by this.

<P>He made up a big blaze, and while it lasted dried himself, and

<P>then lay down by the embers.&nbsp; He could not sleep, but he felt a

<P>great numbness in all his limbs.&nbsp; His restlessness was gone, and

<P>he was content to lay still, measuring the time by watching the

<P>stars that rose in endless succession above the forests, while

<P>the slight puffs of wind under the cloudless sky seemed to fan

<P>their twinkle into a greater brightness.&nbsp; Dreamily he assured

<P>himself over and over again that she would come, till the

<P>certitude crept into his heart and filled him with a great peace.

<P>Yes, when the next day broke, they would be together on the great

<P>blue sea that was like life--away from the forests that were like

<P>death.&nbsp; He murmured the name of Nina into the silent space with
a

<P>tender smile: this seemed to break the spell of stillness, and

<P>far away by the creek a frog croaked loudly as if in answer.&nbsp; A

<P>chorus of loud roars and plaintive calls rose from the mud along

<P>the line of bushes.&nbsp; He laughed heartily; doubtless it was their

<P>love-song.&nbsp; He felt affectionate towards the frogs and listened,

<P>pleased with the noisy life near him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the moon peeped above the trees he felt the old impatience

<P>and the old restlessness steal over him.&nbsp; Why was she so late?

<P>True, it was a long way to come with a single paddle.&nbsp; With what

<P>skill and what endurance could those small hands manage a heavy

<P>paddle!&nbsp; It was very wonderful--such small hands, such soft

<P>little palms that knew how to touch his cheek with a feel lighter

<P>than the fanning of a butterfly's wing.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; He lost

<P>himself lovingly in the contemplation of this tremendous mystery,

<P>and when he looked at the moon again it had risen a hand's

<P>breadth above the trees.&nbsp; Would she come?&nbsp; He forced himself
to

<P>lay still, overcoming the impulse to rise and rush round the

<P>clearing again.&nbsp; He turned this way and that; at last, quivering

<P>with the effort, he lay on his back, and saw her face among the

<P>stars looking down on him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The croaking of frogs suddenly ceased.&nbsp; With the watchfulness of

<P>a hunted man Dain sat up, listening anxiously, and heard several

<P>splashes in the water as the frogs took rapid headers into the

<P>creek.&nbsp; He knew that they had been alarmed by something, and

<P>stood up suspicious and attentive.&nbsp; A slight grating noise, then

<P>the dry sound as of two pieces of wood struck against each other.

<P>Somebody was about to land!&nbsp; He took up an armful of brushwood,

<P>and, without taking his eyes from the path, held it over the

<P>embers of his fire.&nbsp; He waited, undecided, and saw something

<P>gleam amongst the bushes; then a white figure came out of the

<P>shadows and seemed to float towards him in the pale light.&nbsp; His

<P>heart gave a great leap and stood still, then went on shaking his

<P>frame in furious beats.&nbsp; He dropped the brushwood upon the

<P>glowing coals, and had an impression of shouting her name--of

<P>rushing to meet her; yet he emitted no sound, he stirred not an

<P>inch, but he stood silent and motionless like chiselled bronze

<P>under the moonlight that streamed over his naked shoulders.&nbsp; As

<P>he stood still, fighting with his breath, as if bereft of his

<P>senses by the intensity of his delight, she walked up to him with

<P>quick, resolute steps, and, with the appearance of one about to

<P>leap from a dangerous height, threw both her arms round his neck

<P>with a sudden gesture.&nbsp; A small blue gleam crept amongst the dry

<P>branches, and the crackling of reviving fire was the only sound

<P>as they faced each other in the speechless emotion of that

<P>meeting; then the dry fuel caught at once, and a bright hot flame

<P>shot upwards in a blaze as high as their heads, and in its light

<P>they saw each other's eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Neither of them spoke.&nbsp; He was regaining his senses in a slight

<P>tremor that ran upwards along his rigid body and hung about his

<P>trembling lips.&nbsp; She drew back her head and fastened her eyes on

<P>his in one of those long looks that are a woman's most terrible

<P>weapon; a look that is more stirring than the closest touch, and

<P>more dangerous than the thrust of a dagger, because it also whips

<P>the soul out of the body, but leaves the body alive and helpless,

<P>to be swayed here and there by the capricious tempests of passion

<P>and desire; a look that enwraps the whole body, and that

<P>penetrates into the innermost recesses of the being, bringing

<P>terrible defeat in the delirious uplifting of accomplished

<P>conquest.&nbsp; It has the same meaning for the man of the forests and

<P>the sea as for the man threading the paths of the more dangerous

<P>wilderness of houses and streets.&nbsp; Men that had felt in their

<P>breasts the awful exultation such a look awakens become mere

<P>things of to-day--which is paradise; forget yesterday--which was

<P>suffering; care not for to-morrow--which may be perdition.&nbsp; They

<P>wish to live under that look for ever.&nbsp; It is the look of woman's

<P>surrender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He understood, and, as if suddenly released from his invisible

<P>bonds, fell at her feet with a shout of joy, and, embracing her

<P>knees, hid his head in the folds of her dress, murmuring

<P>disjointed words of gratitude and love.&nbsp; Never before had he felt

<P>so proud as now, when at the feet of that woman that half

<P>belonged to his enemies.&nbsp; Her fingers played with his hair in an

<P>absent-minded caress as she stood absorbed in thought.&nbsp; The thing

<P>was done.&nbsp; Her mother was right.&nbsp; The man was her slave.&nbsp;
As she

<P>glanced down at his kneeling form she felt a great pitying

<P>tenderness for that man she was used to call--even in her

<P>thoughts--the master of life.&nbsp; She lifted her eyes and looked

<P>sadly at the southern heavens under which lay the path of their

<P>lives--her own, and that man's at her feet.&nbsp; Did he not say

<P>himself is that she was the light of his life?&nbsp; She would be his

<P>light and his wisdom; she would be his greatness and his

<P>strength; yet hidden from the eyes of all men she would be, above

<P>all, his only and lasting weakness.&nbsp; A very woman!&nbsp; In the

<P>sublime vanity of her kind she was thinking already of moulding a

<P>god from the clay at her feet.&nbsp; A god for others to worship.&nbsp;
She

<P>was content to see him as he was now, and to feel him quiver at

<P>the slightest touch of her light fingers.&nbsp; And while her eyes

<P>looked sadly at the southern stars a faint smile seemed to be

<P>playing about her firm lips.&nbsp; Who can tell in the fitful light
of

<P>a camp fire?&nbsp; It might have been a smile of triumph, or of

<P>conscious power, or of tender pity, or, perhaps, of love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She spoke softly to him, and he rose to his feet, putting his arm

<P>round her in quiet consciousness of his ownership; she laid her

<P>head on his shoulder with a sense of defiance to all the world in

<P>the encircling protection of that arm.&nbsp; He was hers with all his

<P>qualities and all his faults.&nbsp; His strength and his courage, his

<P>recklessness and his daring, his simple wisdom and his savage

<P>cunning--all were hers.&nbsp; As they passed together out of the red

<P>light of the fire into the silver shower of rays that fell upon

<P>the clearing he bent his head over her face, and she saw in his

<P>eyes the dreamy intoxication of boundless felicity from the close

<P>touch of her slight figure clasped to his side.&nbsp; With a

<P>rhythmical swing of their bodies they walked through the light

<P>towards the outlying shadows of the forests that seemed to guard

<P>their happiness in solemn immobility.&nbsp; Their forms melted in the

<P>play of light and shadow at the foot of the big trees, but the

<P>murmur of tender words lingered over the empty clearing, grew

<P>faint, and died out.&nbsp; A sigh as of immense sorrow passed over the

<P>land in the last effort of the dying breeze, and in the deep

<P>silence which succeeded, the earth and the heavens were suddenly

<P>hushed up in the mournful contemplation of human love and human

<P>blindness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They walked slowly back to the fire.&nbsp; He made for her a seat out

<P>of the dry branches, and, throwing himself down at her feet, lay

<P>his head in her lap and gave himself up to the dreamy delight of

<P>the passing hour.&nbsp; Their voices rose and fell, tender or animated

<P>as they spoke of their love and of their future.&nbsp; She, with a few

<P>skilful words spoken from time to time, guided his thoughts, and

<P>he let his happiness flow in a stream of talk passionate and

<P>tender, grave or menacing, according to the mood which she

<P>evoked.&nbsp; He spoke to her of his own island, where the gloomy

<P>forests and the muddy rivers were unknown.&nbsp; He spoke of its

<P>terraced fields, of the murmuring clear rills of sparkling water

<P>that flowed down the sides of great mountains, bringing life to

<P>the land and joy to its tillers.&nbsp; And he spoke also of the

<P>mountain peak that rising lonely above the belt of trees knew the

<P>secrets of the passing clouds, and was the dwelling-place of the

<P>mysterious spirit of his race, of the guardian genius of his

<P>house.&nbsp; He spoke of vast horizons swept by fierce winds that

<P>whistled high above the summits of burning mountains.&nbsp; He spoke

<P>of his forefathers that conquered ages ago the island of which he

<P>was to be the future ruler.&nbsp; And then as, in her interest, she

<P>brought her face nearer to his, he, touching lightly the thick

<P>tresses of her long hair, felt a sudden impulse to speak to her

<P>of the sea he loved so well; and he told her of its never-ceasing

<P>voice, to which he had listened as a child, wondering at its

<P>hidden meaning that no living man has penetrated yet; of its

<P>enchanting glitter; of its senseless and capricious fury; how its

<P>surface was for ever changing, and yet always enticing, while its

<P>depths were for ever the same, cold and cruel, and full of the

<P>wisdom of destroyed life.&nbsp; He told her how it held men slaves of

<P>its charm for a lifetime, and then, regardless of their devotion,

<P>swallowed them up, angry at their fear of its mystery, which it

<P>would never disclose, not even to those that loved it most.

<P>While he talked, Nina's head had been gradually sinking lower,

<P>and her face almost touched his now.&nbsp; Her hair was over his eyes,

<P>her breath was on his forehead, her arms were about his body.&nbsp;
No

<P>two beings could be closer to each other, yet she guessed rather

<P>than understood the meaning of his last words that came out after

<P>a slight hesitation in a faint murmur, dying out imperceptibly

<P>into a profound and significant silence:&nbsp; "The sea, O Nina, is

<P>like a woman's heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She closed his lips with a sudden kiss, and answered in a steady

<P>voice--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But to the men that have no fear, O master of my life, the sea

<P>is ever true."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Over their heads a film of dark, thread-like clouds, looking like

<P>immense cobwebs drifting under the stars, darkened the sky with

<P>the presage of the coming thunderstorm.&nbsp; From the invisible hills

<P>the first distant rumble of thunder came in a prolonged roll

<P>which, after tossing about from hill to hill, lost itself in the

<P>forests of the Pantai.&nbsp; Dain and Nina stood up, and the former

<P>looked at the sky uneasily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is time for Babalatchi to be here," he said.&nbsp; "The night is

<P>more than half gone.&nbsp; Our road is long, and a bullet travels

<P>quicker than the best canoe."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He will be here before the moon is hidden behind the clouds,"

<P>said Nina.&nbsp; "I heard a splash in the water," she added.&nbsp; "Did
you

<P>hear it too?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Alligator," answered Dain shortly, with a careless glance

<P>towards the creek.&nbsp; "The darker the night," he continued, "the

<P>shorter will be our road, for then we could keep in the current

<P>of the main stream, but if it is light--even no more than now--we

<P>must follow the small channels of sleeping water, with nothing to

<P>help our paddles."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dain," interposed Nina, earnestly, "it was no alligator.&nbsp; I

<P>heard the bushes rustling near the landing-place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Dain, after listening awhile.&nbsp; "It cannot be

<P>Babalatchi, who would come in a big war canoe, and openly.&nbsp; Those

<P>that are coming, whoever they are, do not wish to make much

<P>noise.&nbsp; But you have heard, and now I can see," he went on

<P>quickly.&nbsp; "It is but one man.&nbsp; Stand behind me, Nina.&nbsp;
If he is a

<P>friend he is welcome; if he is an enemy you shall see him die."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He laid his hand on his kriss, and awaited the approach of his

<P>unexpected visitor.&nbsp; The fire was burning very low, and small

<P>clouds--precursors of the storm--crossed the face of the moon in

<P>rapid succession, and their flying shadows darkened the clearing.

<P>He could not make out who the man might be, but he felt uneasy at

<P>the steady advance of the tall figure walking on the path with a

<P>heavy tread, and hailed it with a command to stop.&nbsp; The man

<P>stopped at some little distance, and Dain expected him to speak,

<P>but all he could hear was his deep breathing.&nbsp; Through a break
in

<P>the flying clouds a sudden and fleeting brightness descended upon

<P>the clearing.&nbsp; Before the darkness closed in again, Dain saw a

<P>hand holding some glittering object extended towards him, heard

<P>Nina's cry of "Father!" and in an instant the girl was between

<P>him and Almayer's revolver.&nbsp; Nina's loud cry woke up the echoes

<P>of the sleeping woods, and the three stood still as if waiting

<P>for the return of silence before they would give expression to

<P>their various feelings.&nbsp; At the appearance of Nina, Almayer's arm

<P>fell by his side, and he made a step forward.&nbsp; Dain pushed the

<P>girl gently aside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Am I a wild beast that you should try to kill me suddenly and in

<P>the dark, Tuan Almayer?" said Dain, breaking the strained

<P>silence.&nbsp; "Throw some brushwood on the fire," he went on,

<P>speaking to Nina, "while I watch my white friend, lest harm

<P>should come to you or to me, O delight of my heart!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer ground his teeth and raised his arm again.&nbsp; With a quick

<P>bound Dain was at his side: there was a short scuffle, during

<P>which one chamber of the revolver went off harmlessly, then the

<P>weapon, wrenched out of Almayer's hand, whirled through the air

<P>and fell in the bushes.&nbsp; The two men stood close together,

<P>breathing hard.&nbsp; The replenished fire threw out an unsteady

<P>circle of light and shone on the terrified face of Nina, who

<P>looked at them with outstretched hands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dain!" she cried out warningly, "Dain!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He waved his hand towards her in a reassuring gesture, and,

<P>turning to Almayer, said with great courtesy--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now we may talk, Tuan.&nbsp; It is easy to send out death, but can

<P>your wisdom recall the life?&nbsp; She might have been harmed," he

<P>continued, indicating Nina.&nbsp; "Your hand shook much; for myself
I

<P>was not afraid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nina!" exclaimed Almayer, "come to me at once.&nbsp; What is this

<P>sudden madness?&nbsp; What bewitched you?&nbsp; Come to your father,
and

<P>together we shall try to forget this horrible nightmare!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He opened his arms with the certitude of clasping her to his

<P>breast in another second.&nbsp; She did not move.&nbsp; As it dawned
upon

<P>him that she did not mean to obey he felt a deadly cold creep

<P>into his heart, and, pressing the palms of his hands to his

<P>temples, he looked down on the ground in mute despair.&nbsp; Dain took

<P>Nina by the arm and led her towards her father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Speak to him in the language of his people," he said.&nbsp; "He is

<P>grieving--as who would not grieve at losing thee, my pearl!

<P>Speak to him the last words he shall hear spoken by that voice,

<P>which must be very sweet to him, but is all my life to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He released her, and, stepping back a few paces out of the circle

<P>of light, stood in the darkness looking at them with calm

<P>interest.&nbsp; The reflection of a distant flash of lightning lit up

<P>the clouds over their heads, and was followed after a short

<P>interval by the faint rumble of thunder, which mingled with

<P>Almayer's voice as he began to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you know what you are doing?&nbsp; Do you know what is waiting for

<P>you if you follow that man?&nbsp; Have you no pity for yourself?&nbsp;
Do

<P>you know that you shall be at first his plaything and then a

<P>scorned slave, a drudge, and a servant of some new fancy of that

<P>man?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She raised her hand to stop him, and turning her head slightly,

<P>asked--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You hear this Dain!&nbsp; Is it true?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By all the gods!" came the impassioned answer from the

<P>darkness-- "by heaven and earth, by my head and thine I swear:

<P>this is a white man's lie.&nbsp; I have delivered my soul into your

<P>hands for ever; I breathe with your breath, I see with your eyes,

<P>I think with your mind, and I take you into my heart for ever."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You thief!" shouted the exasperated Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A deep silence succeeded this outburst, then the voice of Dain

<P>was heard again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, Tuan," he said in a gentle tone, "that is not true also.

<P>The girl came of her own will.&nbsp; I have done no more but to show

<P>her my love like a man; she heard the cry of my heart, and she

<P>came, and the dowry I have given to the woman you call your

<P>wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer groaned in his extremity of rage and shame.&nbsp; Nina laid

<P>her hand lightly on his shoulder, and the contact, light as the

<P>touch of a falling leaf, seemed to calm him.&nbsp; He spoke quickly,

<P>and in English this time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Tell me," he said--"tell me, what have they done to you, your

<P>mother and that man?&nbsp; What made you give yourself up to that

<P>savage?&nbsp; For he is a savage.&nbsp; Between him and you there is
a

<P>barrier that nothing can remove.&nbsp; I can see in your eyes the look

<P>of those who commit suicide when they are mad.&nbsp; You are mad.

<P>Don't smile.&nbsp; It breaks my heart.&nbsp; If I were to see you drowning

<P>before my eyes, and I without the power to help you, I could not

<P>suffer a greater torment.&nbsp; Have you forgotten the teaching of so

<P>many years?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," she interrupted, "I remember it well.&nbsp; I remember how it

<P>ended also.&nbsp; Scorn for scorn, contempt for contempt, hate for

<P>hate.&nbsp; I am not of your race.&nbsp; Between your people and me
there

<P>is also a barrier that nothing can remove.&nbsp; You ask why I want
to

<P>go, and I ask you why I should stay."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He staggered as if struck in the face, but with a quick,

<P>unhesitating grasp she caught him by the arm and steadied him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why you should stay!" he repeated slowly, in a dazed manner, and

<P>stopped short, astounded at the completeness of his misfortune.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You told me yesterday," she went on again, "that I could not

<P>understand or see your love for me:&nbsp; it is so.&nbsp; How can I?&nbsp;
No

<P>two human beings understand each other.&nbsp; They can understand but

<P>their own voices.&nbsp; You wanted me to dream your dreams, to see

<P>your own visions--the visions of life amongst the white faces of

<P>those who cast me out from their midst in angry contempt.&nbsp; But

<P>while you spoke I listened to the voice of my own self; then this

<P>man came, and all was still; there was only the murmur of his

<P>love.&nbsp; You call him a savage!&nbsp; What do you call my mother,
your

<P>wife?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nina!" cried Almayer, "take your eyes off my face."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She looked down directly, but continued speaking only a little

<P>above a whisper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In time," she went on, "both our voices, that man's and mine,

<P>spoke together in a sweetness that was intelligible to our ears

<P>only.&nbsp; You were speaking of gold then, but our ears were filled

<P>with the song of our love, and we did not hear you.&nbsp; Then I found

<P>that we could see through each other's eyes:&nbsp; that he saw things

<P>that nobody but myself and he could see.&nbsp; We entered a land where

<P>no one could follow us, and least of all you.&nbsp; Then I began to

<P>live."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She paused.&nbsp; Almayer sighed deeply.&nbsp; With her eyes still fixed
on

<P>the ground she began speaking again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I mean to live.&nbsp; I mean to follow him.&nbsp; I have been rejected

<P>with scorn by the white people, and now I am a Malay!&nbsp; He took
me

<P>in his arms, he laid his life at my feet.&nbsp; He is brave; he will

<P>be powerful, and I hold his bravery and his strength in my hand,

<P>and I shall make him great.&nbsp; His name shall be remembered long

<P>after both our bodies are laid in the dust.&nbsp; I love you no less

<P>than I did before, but I shall never leave him, for without him I

<P>cannot live."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If he understood what you have said," answered Almayer,

<P>scornfully, "he must be highly flattered.&nbsp; You want him as a tool

<P>for some incomprehensible ambition of yours.&nbsp; Enough, Nina.&nbsp;
If

<P>you do not go down at once to the creek, where Ali is waiting

<P>with my canoe, I shall tell him to return to the settlement and

<P>bring the Dutch officers here.&nbsp; You cannot escape from this

<P>clearing, for I have cast adrift your canoe.&nbsp; If the Dutch catch

<P>this hero of yours they will hang him as sure as I stand here.

<P>Now go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made a step towards his daughter and laid hold of her by the

<P>shoulder, his other hand pointing down the path to the

<P>landing-place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Beware!" exclaimed Dain; "this woman belongs to me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nina wrenched herself free and looked straight at Almayer's angry

<P>face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I will not go," she said with desperate energy.&nbsp; "If he dies

<P>I shall die too!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You die!" said Almayer, contemptuously.&nbsp; "Oh, no!&nbsp; You shall

<P>live a life of lies and deception till some other vagabond comes

<P>along to sing; how did you say that?&nbsp; The song of love to you!

<P>Make up your mind quickly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He waited for a while, and then added meaningly--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shall I call out to Ali?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Call out," she answered in Malay, "you that cannot be true to

<P>your own countrymen.&nbsp; Only a few days ago you were selling the

<P>powder for their destruction; now you want to give up to them the

<P>man that yesterday you called your friend.&nbsp; Oh, Dain," she said,

<P>turning towards the motionless but attentive figure in the

<P>darkness, "instead of bringing you life I bring you death, for he

<P>will betray unless I leave you for ever!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain came into the circle of light, and, throwing his arm around

<P>Nina's neck, whispered in her ear--"I can kill him where he

<P>stands, before a sound can pass his lips.&nbsp; For you it is to say

<P>yes or no.&nbsp; Babalatchi cannot be far now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He straightened himself up, taking his arm off her shoulder, and

<P>confronted Almayer, who looked at them both with an expression of

<P>concentrated fury,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No!" she cried, clinging to Dain in wild alarm.&nbsp; "No!&nbsp; Kill
me!

<P>Then perhaps he will let you go.&nbsp; You do not know the mind of a

<P>white man.&nbsp; He would rather see me dead than standing where I am.

<P>Forgive me, your slave, but you must not."&nbsp; She fell at his feet

<P>sobbing violently and repeating, "Kill me!&nbsp; Kill me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want you alive," said Almayer, speaking also in Malay, with

<P>sombre calmness.&nbsp; "You go, or he hangs.&nbsp; Will you obey?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain shook Nina off, and, making a sudden lunge, struck Almayer

<P>full in the chest with the handle of his kriss, keeping the point

<P>towards himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hai, look! It was easy for me to turn the point the other way,"

<P>he said in his even voice.&nbsp; "Go, Tuan Putih," he added with

<P>dignity.&nbsp; "I give you your life, my life, and her life.&nbsp; I
am the

<P>slave of this woman's desire, and she wills it so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was not a glimmer of light in the sky now, and the tops of

<P>the trees were as invisible as their trunks, being lost in the

<P>mass of clouds that hung low over the woods, the clearing, and

<P>the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Every outline had disappeared in the intense blackness that

<P>seemed to have destroyed everything but space.&nbsp; Only the fire

<P>glimmered like a star forgotten in this annihilation of all

<P>visible things, and nothing was heard after Dain ceased speaking

<P>but the sobs of Nina, whom he held in his arms, kneeling beside

<P>the fire.&nbsp; Almayer stood looking down at them in gloomy

<P>thoughtfulness.&nbsp; As he was opening his lips to speak they were

<P>startled by a cry of warning by the riverside, followed by the

<P>splash of many paddles and the sound of voices.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Babalatchi!" shouted Dain, lifting up Nina as he got upon his

<P>feet quickly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ada!&nbsp; Ada!" came the answer from the panting statesman who ran

<P>up the path and stood amongst them.&nbsp; "Run to my canoe," he said

<P>to Dain excitedly, without taking any notice of Almayer.&nbsp; "Run!

<P>we must go.&nbsp; That woman has told them all!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What woman?" asked Dain, looking at Nina.&nbsp; Just then there was

<P>only one woman in the whole world for him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The she-dog with white teeth; the seven times accursed slave of

<P>Bulangi.&nbsp; She yelled at Abdulla's gate till she woke up all

<P>Sambir.&nbsp; Now the white officers are coming, guided by her and

<P>Reshid.&nbsp; If you want to live, do not look at me, but go!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you know this?" asked Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Tuan! what matters how I know!&nbsp; I have only one eye, but I

<P>saw lights in Abdulla's house and in his campong as we were

<P>paddling past.&nbsp; I have ears, and while we lay under the bank I

<P>have heard the messengers sent out to the white men's house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will you depart without that woman who is my daughter?" said

<P>Almayer, addressing Dain, while Babalatchi stamped with

<P>impatience, muttering, "Run!&nbsp; Run at once!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," answered Dain, steadily, "I will not go; to no man will I

<P>abandon this woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then kill me and escape yourself," sobbed out Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He clasped her close, looking at her tenderly, and whispered, "We

<P>will never part, O Nina!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall not stay here any longer," broke in Babalatchi, angrily.

<P>"This is great foolishness.&nbsp; No woman is worth a man's life.&nbsp;
I

<P>am an old man, and I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He picked up his staff, and, turning to go, looked at Dain as if

<P>offering him his last chance of escape.&nbsp; But Dain's face was

<P>hidden amongst Nina's black tresses, and he did not see this last

<P>appealing glance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Babalatchi vanished in the darkness.&nbsp; Shortly after his

<P>disappearance they heard the war canoe leave the landing-place in

<P>the swish of the numerous paddles dipped in the water together.

<P>Almost at the same time Ali came up from the riverside, two

<P>paddles on his shoulder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our canoe is hidden up the creek, Tuan Almayer," he said, "in

<P>the dense bush where the forest comes down to the water.&nbsp; I took

<P>it there because I heard from Babalatchi's paddlers that the

<P>white men are coming here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wait for me there," said Almayer, "but keep the canoe hidden."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He remained silent, listening to Ali's footsteps, then turned to

<P>Nina.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nina," he said sadly, "will you have no pity for me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no answer.&nbsp; She did not even turn her head, which was

<P>pressed close to Dain's breast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made a movement as if to leave them and stopped.&nbsp; By the dim

<P>glow of the burning-out fire he saw their two motionless figures.

<P>The woman's back turned to him with the long black hair streaming

<P>down over the white dress, and Dain's calm face looking at him

<P>above her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot," he muttered to himself.&nbsp; After a long pause he spoke

<P>again a little lower, but in an unsteady voice, "It would be too

<P>great a disgrace.&nbsp; I am a white man."&nbsp; He broke down completely

<P>there, and went on tearfully, "I am a white man, and of good

<P>family.&nbsp; Very good family," he repeated, weeping bitterly.&nbsp;
"It

<P>would be a disgrace . . .&nbsp; all over the islands, . . . the only

<P>white man on the east coast.&nbsp; No, it cannot be . . . white men

<P>finding my daughter with this Malay.&nbsp; My daughter!" he cried

<P>aloud, with a ring of despair in his voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He recovered his composure after a while and said distinctly--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will never forgive you, Nina--never! If you were to come back

<P>to me now, the memory of this night would poison all my life.&nbsp;
I

<P>shall try to forget.&nbsp; I have no daughter.&nbsp; There used to be
a

<P>half-caste woman in my house, but she is going even now.&nbsp; You,

<P>Dain, or whatever your name may be, I shall take you and that

<P>woman to the island at the mouth of the river myself.&nbsp; Come with

<P>me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He led the way, following the bank as far as the forest.&nbsp; Ali

<P>answered to his call, and, pushing their way through the dense

<P>bush, they stepped into the canoe hidden under the overhanging

<P>branches.&nbsp; Dain laid Nina in the bottom, and sat holding her head

<P>on his knees.&nbsp; Almayer and Ali each took up a paddle.&nbsp; As
they

<P>were going to push out Ali hissed warningly.&nbsp; All listened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the great stillness before the bursting out of the

<P>thunderstorm they could hear the sound of oars working regularly

<P>in their row-locks.&nbsp; The sound approached steadily, and Dain,

<P>looking through the branches, could see the faint shape of a big

<P>white boat.&nbsp; A woman's voice said in a cautious tone--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is the place where you may land white men; a little higher

<P>--there!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The boat was passing them so close in the narrow creek that the

<P>blades of the long oars nearly touched the canoe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Way enough! Stand by to jump on shore!&nbsp; He is alone and

<P>unarmed," was the quiet order in a man's voice, and in Dutch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Somebody else whispered: "I think I can see a glimmer of a fire

<P>through the bush."&nbsp; And then the boat floated past them,

<P>disappearing instantly in the darkness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now," whispered Ali, eagerly, "let us push out and paddle away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little canoe swung into the stream, and as it sprung forward

<P>in response to the vigorous dig of the paddles they could hear an

<P>angry shout.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He is not by the fire.&nbsp; Spread out, men, and search for him!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Blue lights blazed out in different parts of the clearing, and

<P>the shrill voice of a woman cried in accents of rage and pain--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Too late!&nbsp; O senseless white men!&nbsp; He has escaped!"
