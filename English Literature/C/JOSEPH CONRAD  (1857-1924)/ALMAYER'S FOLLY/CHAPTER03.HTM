<P>The deliberations conducted in London have a far-reaching

<P>importance, and so the decision issued from the fog-veiled

<P>offices of the Borneo Company darkened for Almayer the brilliant

<P>sunshine of the Tropics, and added another drop of bitterness to

<P>the cup of his disenchantments.&nbsp; The claim to that part of the

<P>East Coast was abandoned, leaving the Pantai river under the

<P>nominal power of Holland.&nbsp; In Sambir there was joy and

<P>excitement.&nbsp; The slaves were hurried out of sight into the forest

<P>and jungle, and the flags were run up to tall poles in the

<P>Rajah's compound in expectation of a visit from Dutch man-of-war

<P>boats.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The frigate remained anchored outside the mouth of the river, and

<P>the boats came up in tow of the steam launch, threading their way

<P>cautiously amongst a crowd of canoes filled with gaily dressed

<P>Malays.&nbsp; The officer in command listened gravely to the loyal

<P>speeches of Lakamba, returned the salaams of Abdulla, and assured

<P>those gentlemen in choice Malay of the great Rajah's--down in

<P>Batavia--friendship and goodwill towards the ruler and

<P>inhabitants of this model state of Sambir.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer from his verandah watched across the river the festive

<P>proceedings, heard the report of brass guns saluting the new flag

<P>presented to Lakamba, and the deep murmur of the crowd of

<P>spectators surging round the stockade.&nbsp; The smoke of the firing

<P>rose in white clouds on the green background of the forests, and

<P>he could not help comparing his own fleeting hopes to the rapidly

<P>disappearing vapour.&nbsp; He was by no means patriotically elated by

<P>the event, yet he had to force himself into a gracious behaviour

<P>when, the official reception being over, the naval officers of

<P>the Commission crossed the river to pay a visit to the solitary

<P>white man of whom they had heard, no doubt wishing also to catch

<P>a glimpse of his daughter.&nbsp; In that they were disappointed, Nina

<P>refusing to show herself; but they seemed easily consoled by the

<P>gin and cheroots set before them by the hospitable Almayer; and

<P>sprawling comfortably on the lame armchairs under the shade of

<P>the verandah, while the blazing sunshine outside seemed to&nbsp; set

<P>the great river simmering in the heat, they filled the little

<P>bungalow with the unusual sounds of European languages, with

<P>noise and laughter produced by naval witticisms at the expense of

<P>the fat Lakamba whom they had been complimenting so much that

<P>very morning.&nbsp; The younger men in an access of good fellowship

<P>made their host talk, and Almayer, excited by the sight of

<P>European faces, by the sound of European voices, opened his heart

<P>before the sympathising strangers, unaware of the amusement the

<P>recital of his many misfortunes caused to those future admirals.

<P>They drank his health, wished him many big diamonds and a

<P>mountain of gold, expressed even an envy of the high destinies

<P>awaiting him yet.&nbsp; Encouraged by so much friendliness, the

<P>grey-headed and foolish dreamer invited his guests to visit his

<P>new house.&nbsp; They went there through the long grass in a

<P>straggling procession while their boats were got ready for the

<P>return down the river in the cool of the evening.&nbsp; And in the

<P>great empty rooms where the tepid wind entering through the

<P>sashless windows whirled gently the dried leaves and the dust of

<P>many days of neglect, Almayer in his white jacket and flowered

<P>sarong, surrounded by a circle of glittering uniforms, stamped

<P>his foot to show the solidity of the neatly-fitting floors and

<P>expatiated upon the beauties and convenience of the building.

<P>They listened and assented, amazed by the wonderful simplicity

<P>and the foolish hopefulness of the man, till Almayer, carried

<P>away by his excitement, disclosed his regret at the non-arrival

<P>of the English, "who knew how to develop a rich country," as he

<P>expressed it.&nbsp; There was a general laugh amongst the Dutch

<P>officers at that unsophisticated statement, and a move was made

<P>towards the boats; but when Almayer, stepping cautiously on the

<P>rotten boards of the Lingard jetty, tried to approach the chief

<P>of the Commission with some timid hints anent the protection

<P>required by the Dutch subject against the wily Arabs, that salt

<P>water diplomat told him significantly that the Arabs were better

<P>subjects than Hollanders who dealt illegally in gunpowder with

<P>the Malays.&nbsp; The innocent Almayer recognised there at once the

<P>oily tongue of Abdulla and the solemn persuasiveness of Lakamba,

<P>but ere he had time to frame an indignant protest the steam

<P>launch and the string of boats moved rapidly down the river

<P>leaving him on the jetty, standing open-mouthed in his surprise

<P>and anger.&nbsp; There are thirty miles of river from Sambir to&nbsp;
the

<P>gem-like islands of the estuary where the frigate was awaiting

<P>the return of the boats.&nbsp; The moon rose long before the boats had

<P>traversed half that distance, and the black forest sleeping

<P>peacefully under her cold rays woke up that night to the ringing

<P>laughter in the small flotilla provoked by some reminiscence of

<P>Almayer's lamentable narrative.&nbsp; Salt-water jests at the poor

<P>man's expense were passed from boat to boat, the non-appearance

<P>of his daughter was commented upon with severe displeasure, and

<P>the half-finished house built for the reception of Englishmen

<P>received on that joyous night the name of "Almayer's Folly" by

<P>the unanimous vote of the lighthearted seamen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For many weeks after this visit life in Sambir resumed its even

<P>and uneventful flow.&nbsp; Each day's sun shooting its morning rays

<P>above the tree-tops lit up the usual scene of daily activity.

<P>Nina walking on the path that formed the only street in the

<P>settlement saw the accustomed sight of men lolling on the shady

<P>side of the houses, on the high platforms; of women busily

<P>engaged in husking the daily rice; of naked brown children racing

<P>along the shady and narrow paths leading to the clearings.

<P>Jim-Eng, strolling before his house, greeted her with a friendly

<P>nod before climbing up indoors to seek his beloved opium pipe.

<P>The elder children clustered round her, daring from long

<P>acquaintance, pulling the skirts of her white robe with their

<P>dark fingers, and showing their brilliant teeth in expectation

<P>of a shower of glass beads.&nbsp; She greeted them with a quiet smile,

<P>but always had a few friendly words for a Siamese girl, a slave

<P>owned by Bulangi, whose numerous wives were said to be of a

<P>violent temper.&nbsp; Well-founded rumour said also that the domestic

<P>squabbles of that industrious cultivator ended generally in a

<P>combined assault of all his wives upon the Siamese slave.&nbsp; The

<P>girl herself never complained--perhaps from dictates of prudence,

<P>but more likely through the strange, resigned apathy of

<P>half-savage womankind.&nbsp; From early morning she was to be seen on

<P>the paths amongst the houses--by the riverside or on the jetties,

<P>the tray of pastry, it was her mission to sell, skilfully

<P>balanced on her head.&nbsp; During the great heat of the day she

<P>usually sought refuge in Almayer's campong, often finding shelter

<P>in a shady corner of the verandah, where she squatted with her

<P>tray before her, when invited by Nina.&nbsp; For "Mem Putih" she had

<P>always a smile, but the presence of Mrs. Almayer, the very sound

<P>of her shrill voice, was the signal for a hurried departure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To this girl Nina often spoke; the other inhabitants of Sambir

<P>seldom or never heard the sound of her voice.&nbsp; They got used to

<P>the silent figure moving in their midst calm and white-robed, a

<P>being from another world and incomprehensible to them.&nbsp; Yet

<P>Nina's life for all her outward composure, for all the seeming

<P>detachment from the things and people surrounding her, was far

<P>from quiet, in consequence of Mrs. Almayer being much too active

<P>for the happiness and even safety of the household.&nbsp; She had

<P>resumed some intercourse with Lakamba, not personally, it is true

<P>(for the dignity of that potentate kept him inside his stockade),

<P>but through the agency of that potentate's prime minister,

<P>harbour master, financial adviser, and general factotum.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That

<P>gentleman--of Sulu origin--was certainly endowed with

<P>statesmanlike qualities, although he was totally devoid of

<P>personal charms.&nbsp; In truth he was perfectly repulsive, possessing

<P>only one eye and a pockmarked face, with nose and lips horribly

<P>disfigured by the small-pox.&nbsp; This unengaging individual often

<P>strolled into Almayer's garden in unofficial costume, composed of

<P>a piece of pink calico round his waist.&nbsp; There at the back of the

<P>house, squatting on his heels on scattered embers, in close

<P>proximity to the great iron boiler, where the family daily rice

<P>was being cooked by the women under Mrs. Almayer's

<P>superintendence, did that astute negotiator carry on long

<P>conversations in Sulu language with Almayer's wife.&nbsp; What the

<P>subject of their discourses was might have been guessed from the

<P>subsequent domestic scenes by Almayer's hearthstone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of late Almayer had taken to excursions up the river.&nbsp; In a small

<P>canoe with two paddlers and the faithful Ali for a steersman he

<P>would disappear for a few days at a time.&nbsp; All his movements were

<P>no doubt closely watched by Lakamba and Abdulla, for the man once

<P>in the confidence of Rajah Laut was supposed to be in possession

<P>of valuable secrets.&nbsp; The coast population of Borneo believes

<P>implicitly in diamonds of fabulous value, in gold mines of

<P>enormous richness in the interior.&nbsp; And all those imaginings are

<P>heightened by the difficulty of penetrating far inland,

<P>especially on the north-east coast, where the Malays and the

<P>river tribes of Dyaks or Head-hunters are eternally quarrelling.

<P>It is true enough that some gold reaches the coast in the hands

<P>of those Dyaks when, during short periods of truce in the

<P>desultory warfare, they visit the coast settlements of Malays.

<P>And so the wildest exaggerations are built up and added to on the

<P>slight basis of that fact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer in his quality of white man--as Lingard before him--had

<P>somewhat better relations with the up-river tribes.&nbsp; Yet even his

<P>excursions were not without danger, and his returns were eagerly

<P>looked for by the impatient Lakamba.&nbsp; But every time the Rajah

<P>was disappointed.&nbsp; Vain were the conferences by the rice-pot of

<P>his factotum Babalatchi with the white man's wife.&nbsp; The white man

<P>himself was impenetrable--impenetrable to persuasion, coaxing,

<P>abuse; to soft words and shrill revilings; to desperate

<P>beseechings or murderous threats; for Mrs. Almayer, in her

<P>extreme desire to persuade her husband into an alliance with

<P>Lakamba, played upon the whole gamut of passion.&nbsp; With her soiled

<P>robe wound tightly under the armpits across her lean bosom, her

<P>scant grayish hair tumbled in disorder over her projecting

<P>cheek-bones, in suppliant attitude, she depicted with shrill

<P>volubility the advantages of close union with a man so good and

<P>so fair dealing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why don't you go to the Rajah?" she screamed.&nbsp; "Why do you go

<P>back to those Dyaks in the great forest?&nbsp; They should be killed.

<P>You cannot kill them, you cannot; but our Rajah's men are brave!

<P>You tell the Rajah where the old white man's treasure is.&nbsp; Our

<P>Rajah is good!&nbsp; He is our very grandfather, Datu Besar!&nbsp; He
will

<P>kill those wretched Dyaks, and you shall have half the treasure.

<P>Oh, Kaspar, tell where the treasure is!&nbsp; Tell me!&nbsp; Tell me
out of

<P>the old man's surat where you read so often at night"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On those occasions Almayer sat with rounded shoulders bending to

<P>the blast of this domestic tempest, accentuating only each pause

<P>in the torrent of his wife's eloquence by an angry growl, "There

<P>is no treasure!&nbsp; Go away, woman!"&nbsp; Exasperated by the sight
of

<P>his patiently bent back, she would at last walk round so as to

<P>face him across the table, and clasping her robe with one hand

<P>she stretched the other lean arm and claw-like hand to emphasise,

<P>in a passion of anger and contempt, the rapid rush of scathing

<P>remarks and bitter cursings heaped on the head of the man

<P>unworthy to associate with brave Malay chiefs.&nbsp; It ended

<P>generally by Almayer rising slowly, his long pipe in hand, his

<P>face set into a look of inward pain, and walking away in silence.

<P>He descended the steps and plunged into the long grass on his way

<P>to the solitude of his new house, dragging his feet in a state of

<P>physical collapse from disgust and fear before that fury.&nbsp; She

<P>followed to the head of the steps, and sent the shafts of

<P>indiscriminate abuse after the retreating form.&nbsp; And each of

<P>those scenes was concluded by a piercing shriek, reaching him far

<P>away.&nbsp; "You know, Kaspar, I am your wife! your own Christian wife

<P>after your own Blanda law!"&nbsp; For she knew that this was the

<P>bitterest thing of all; the greatest regret of that man's life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All these scenes Nina witnessed unmoved.&nbsp; She might have been

<P>deaf, dumb, without any feeling as far as any expression of

<P>opinion went.&nbsp; Yet oft when her father had sought the refuge of

<P>the great dusty rooms of "Almayer's Folly," and her mother,

<P>exhausted by rhetorical efforts, squatted wearily on her heels

<P>with her back against the leg of the table, Nina would approach

<P>her curiously, guarding her skirts from betel juice besprinkling

<P>the floor, and gaze down upon her as one might look into the

<P>quiescent crater of a volcano after a destructive eruption.&nbsp; Mrs.

<P>Almayer's thoughts, after these scenes, were usually turned into

<P>a channel of childhood reminiscences, and she gave them

<P>utterance in a kind of monotonous recitative--slightly

<P>disconnected, but generally describing the glories of the Sultan

<P>of Sulu, his great splendour, his power, his great prowess; the

<P>fear which benumbed the hearts of white men at the sight of his

<P>swift piratical praus.&nbsp; And these muttered statements of her

<P>grandfather's might were mixed up with bits of later

<P>recollections, where the great fight with the "White Devil's"

<P>brig and the convent life in Samarang occupied the principal

<P>place.&nbsp; At that point she usually dropped the thread of her

<P>narrative, and pulling out the little brass cross, always

<P>suspended round her neck, she contemplated it with superstitious

<P>awe.&nbsp; That superstitious feeling connected with some vague

<P>talismanic properties of the little bit of metal, and the still

<P>more hazy but terrible notion of some bad Djinns and horrible

<P>torments invented, as she thought, for her especial punishment by

<P>the good Mother Superior in case of the loss of the above charm,

<P>were Mrs. Almayer's only theological luggage for the stormy road

<P>of life.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer had at least something tangible to cling

<P>to, but Nina, brought up under the Protestant wing of the proper

<P>Mrs. Vinck, had not even a little piece of brass to remind her of

<P>past teaching.&nbsp; And listening to the recital of those savage

<P>glories, those barbarous fights and savage feasting, to the story

<P>of deeds valorous, albeit somewhat bloodthirsty, where men of her

<P>mother's race shone far above the Orang Blanda, she felt herself

<P>irresistibly fascinated, and saw with vague surprise the narrow

<P>mantle of civilised morality, in which good-meaning people had

<P>wrapped her young soul, fall away and leave her shivering and

<P>helpless as if on the edge of some deep and unknown abyss.

<P>Strangest of all, this abyss did not frighten her when she was

<P>under the influence of the witch-like being she called her

<P>mother.&nbsp; She seemed to have forgotten in civilised surroundings

<P>her life before the time when Lingard had, so to speak, kidnapped

<P>her from Brow.&nbsp; Since then she had had Christian teaching, social

<P>education, and a good glimpse of civilised life.&nbsp; Unfortunately

<P>her teachers did not understand her nature, and the education

<P>ended in a scene of humiliation, in an outburst of contempt from

<P>white people for her mixed blood.&nbsp; She had tasted the whole

<P>bitterness of it and remembered distinctly that the virtuous Mrs.

<P>Vinck's indignation was not so much directed against the young

<P>man from the bank as against the innocent cause of that young

<P>man's infatuation.&nbsp; And there was also no doubt in her mind that

<P>the principal cause of Mrs. Vinck's indignation was the thought

<P>that such a thing should happen in a white nest, where her

<P>snow-white doves, the two Misses Vinck, had just returned from

<P>Europe, to find shelter under the maternal wing, and there await

<P>the coming of irreproachable men of their destiny.&nbsp; Not even the

<P>thought of the money so painfully scraped together by Almayer,

<P>and so punctually sent for Nina's expenses, could dissuade Mrs.

<P>Vinck from her virtuous resolve.&nbsp; Nina was sent away, and in

<P>truth the girl herself wanted to go, although a little frightened

<P>by the impending change.&nbsp; And now she had lived on the river for

<P>three years with a savage mother and a father walking about

<P>amongst pitfalls, with his head in the clouds, weak, irresolute,

<P>and unhappy.&nbsp; She had lived a life devoid of all the decencies
of

<P>civilisation, in miserable domestic conditions; she had breathed

<P>in the atmosphere of sordid plottings for gain, of the no less

<P>disgusting intrigues and crimes for lust or money; and those

<P>things, together with the domestic quarrels, were the only events

<P>of her three years' existence.&nbsp; She did not die from despair and

<P>disgust the first month, as she expected and almost hoped for.

<P>On the contrary, at the end of half a year it had seemed to her

<P>that she had known no other life.&nbsp; Her young mind having been

<P>unskilfully permitted to glance at better things, and then thrown

<P>back again into the hopeless quagmire of barbarism, full of

<P>strong and uncontrolled passions, had lost the power to

<P>discriminate.&nbsp; It seemed to Nina that there was no change and&nbsp;
no

<P>difference.&nbsp; Whether they traded in brick godowns or on the muddy

<P>river bank; whether they reached after much or little; whether

<P>they made love under the shadows of the great trees or in the

<P>shadow of the cathedral on the Singapore promenade; whether they

<P>plotted for their own ends under the protection of laws and

<P>according to the rules of Christian conduct, or whether they

<P>sought the gratification of their desires with the savage cunning

<P>and the unrestrained fierceness of natures as innocent of culture

<P>as their own immense and gloomy forests, Nina saw only the same

<P>manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing the

<P>uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes.

<P>To her resolute nature, however, after all these years, the

<P>savage and uncompromising sincerity of purpose shown by her

<P>Malay kinsmen seemed at last preferable to the sleek hypocrisy,

<P>to the polite disguises, to the virtuous pretences of such white

<P>people as she had had the misfortune to come in contact with.

<P>After all it was her life; it was going to be her life, and so

<P>thinking she fell more and more under the influence of her

<P>mother.&nbsp; Seeking, in her ignorance, a better side to that life,

<P>she listened with avidity to the old woman's tales of the

<P>departed glories of the Rajahs, from whose race she had sprung,

<P>and she became gradually more indifferent, more contemptuous of

<P>the white side of her descent represented by a feeble and

<P>traditionless father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer's difficulties were by no means diminished by the girl's

<P>presence in Sambir.&nbsp; The stir caused by her arrival had died out,

<P>it is true, and Lakamba had not renewed his visits; but about a

<P>year after the departure of the man-of-war boats the nephew of

<P>Abdulla, Syed Reshid, returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca,

<P>rejoicing in a green jacket and the proud title of Hadji.&nbsp; There

<P>was a great letting off of rockets on board the steamer which

<P>brought him in, and a great beating of drums all night in

<P>Abdulla's compound, while the feast of welcome was prolonged far

<P>into the small hours of the morning.&nbsp; Reshid was the favourite

<P>nephew and heir of Abdulla, and that loving uncle, meeting

<P>Almayer one day by the riverside, stopped politely to exchange

<P>civilities and to ask solemnly for an interview.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>suspected some attempt at a swindle, or at any rate something

<P>unpleasant, but of course consented with a great show of

<P>rejoicing.&nbsp; Accordingly the next evening, after sunset, Abdulla

<P>came, accompanied by several other grey-beards and by his nephew.

<P>That young man--of a very rakish and dissipated appearance--

<P>affected the greatest indifference as to the whole of the

<P>proceedings.&nbsp; When the torch-bearers had grouped themselves below

<P>the steps, and the visitors had seated themselves on various lame

<P>chairs, Reshid stood apart in the shadow, examining his

<P>aristocratically small hands with great attention.&nbsp; Almayer,

<P>surprised by the great solemnity of his visitors, perched himself

<P>on the corner of the table with a characteristic want of dignity

<P>quickly noted by the Arabs with grave disapproval.&nbsp; But Abdulla

<P>spoke now, looking straight past Almayer at the red curtain

<P>hanging in the doorway, where a slight tremor disclosed the

<P>presence of women on the other side.&nbsp; He began by neatly

<P>complimenting Almayer upon the long years they had dwelt together

<P>in cordial neighbourhood, and called upon Allah to give him many

<P>more years to gladden the eyes of his friends by his welcome

<P>presence.&nbsp; He made a polite allusion to the great consideration

<P>shown him (Almayer) by the Dutch "Commissie," and drew thence the

<P>flattering inference of Almayer's great importance amongst his

<P>own people.&nbsp; He--Abdulla--was also important amongst all the

<P>Arabs, and his nephew Reshid would be heir of that social

<P>position and of great riches.&nbsp; Now Reshid was a Hadji.&nbsp; He
was

<P>possessor of several Malay women, went on Abdulla, but it was

<P>time he had a favourite wife, the first of the four allowed by

<P>the Prophet.&nbsp; And, speaking with well-bred politeness, he

<P>explained further to the dumbfounded Almayer that, if he would

<P>consent to the alliance of his offspring with that true believer

<P>and virtuous man Reshid, she would be the mistress of all the

<P>splendours of Reshid's house, and first wife of the first Arab in

<P>the Islands, when he--Abdulla--was called to the joys of Paradise

<P>by Allah the All-merciful.&nbsp; "You know, Tuan," he said, in

<P>conclusion, "the other women would be her slaves, and Reshid's

<P>house is great.&nbsp; From Bombay he has brought great divans, and

<P>costly carpets, and European furniture.&nbsp; There is also a great

<P>looking-glass in a frame shining like gold.&nbsp; What could a girl

<P>want more?"&nbsp; And while Almayer looked upon him in silent dismay

<P>Abdulla spoke in a more confidential tone, waving his attendants

<P>away, and finished his speech by pointing out the material

<P>advantages of such an alliance, and offering to settle upon

<P>Almayer three thousand dollars as a sign of his sincere

<P>friendship and the price of the girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Almayer was nearly having a fit.&nbsp; Burning with the desire
of

<P>taking Abdulla by the throat, he had but to think of his helpless

<P>position in the midst of lawless men to comprehend the necessity

<P>of diplomatic conciliation.&nbsp; He mastered his impulses, and spoke

<P>politely and coldly, saying the girl was young and as the apple

<P>of his eye.&nbsp; Tuan Reshid, a Faithful and a Hadji, would not want

<P>an infidel woman in his harem; and, seeing Abdulla smile

<P>sceptically at that last objection, he remained silent, not

<P>trusting himself to speak more, not daring to refuse point-blank,

<P>nor yet to say anything compromising.&nbsp; Abdulla understood the

<P>meaning of that silence, and rose to take leave with a grave

<P>salaam.&nbsp; He wished his friend Almayer "a thousand years," and

<P>moved down the steps, helped dutifully by Reshid.&nbsp; The torch-

<P>bearers shook their torches, scattering a shower of sparks into

<P>the river, and the cortege moved off, leaving Almayer agitated

<P>but greatly relieved by their departure.&nbsp; He dropped into a chair

<P>and watched the glimmer of the lights amongst the tree trunks

<P>till they disappeared and complete silence succeeded the tramp of

<P>feet and the murmur of voices.&nbsp; He did not move till the curtain

<P>rustled and Nina came out on the verandah and sat in the

<P>rocking-chair, where she used to spend many hours every day.&nbsp; She

<P>gave a slight rocking motion to her seat, leaning back with

<P>half-closed eyes, her long hair shading her face from the smoky

<P>light of the lamp on the table.&nbsp; Almayer looked at her furtively,

<P>but the face was as impassible as ever.&nbsp; She turned her head

<P>slightly towards her father, and, speaking, to his great

<P>surprise, in English, asked--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Was that Abdulla here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Almayer--"just gone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And what did he want, father?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He wanted to buy you for Reshid," answered Almayer, brutally,

<P>his anger getting the better of him, and looking at the girl as

<P>if in expectation of some outbreak of feeling.&nbsp; But Nina remained

<P>apparently unmoved, gazing dreamily into the black night outside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Be careful, Nina," said Almayer, after a short silence and

<P>rising from his chair, "when you go paddling alone into the

<P>creeks in your canoe.&nbsp; That Reshid is a violent scoundrel, and

<P>there is no saying what he may do.&nbsp; Do you hear me?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was standing now, ready to go in, one hand grasping the

<P>curtain in the doorway.&nbsp; She turned round, throwing her heavy

<P>tresses back by a sudden gesture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think he would dare?" she asked, quickly, and then turned

<P>again to go in, adding in a lower tone, "He would not dare.

<P>Arabs are all cowards."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer looked after her, astonished.&nbsp; He did not seek the repose

<P>of his hammock.&nbsp; He walked the floor absently, sometimes stopping

<P>by the balustrade to think.&nbsp; The lamp went out.&nbsp; The first
streak

<P>of dawn broke over the forest; Almayer shivered in the damp air.

<P>"I give it up," he muttered to himself, lying down wearily.

<P>"Damn those women!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; If the girl did not look as if
she

<P>wanted to be kidnapped!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And he felt a nameless fear creep into his heart, making him

<P>shiver again.
