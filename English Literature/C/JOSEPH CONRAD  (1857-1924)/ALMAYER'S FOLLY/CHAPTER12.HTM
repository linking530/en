<P>"That is the place," said Dain, indicating with the blade of his

<P>paddle a small islet about a mile ahead of the canoe--"that is

<P>the place where Babalatchi promised that a boat from the prau

<P>would come for me when the sun is overhead.&nbsp; We will wait for

<P>that boat there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer, who was steering, nodded without speaking, and by a

<P>slight sweep of his paddle laid the head of the canoe in the

<P>required direction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were just leaving the southern outlet of the Pantai, which

<P>lay behind them in a straight and long vista of water shining

<P>between two walls of thick verdure that ran downwards and towards

<P>each other, till at last they joined and sank together in the

<P>far-away distance.&nbsp; The sun, rising above the calm waters of the

<P>Straits, marked its own path by a streak of light that glided

<P>upon the sea and darted up the wide reach of the river, a hurried

<P>messenger of light and life to the gloomy forests of the coast;

<P>and in this radiance of the sun's pathway floated the black canoe

<P>heading for the islet which lay bathed in sunshine, the yellow

<P>sands of its encircling beach shining like an inlaid golden disc

<P>on the polished steel of the unwrinkled sea.&nbsp; To the north and

<P>south of it rose other islets, joyous in their brilliant

<P>colouring of green and yellow, and on the main coast the sombre

<P>line of mangrove bushes ended to the southward in the reddish

<P>cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah, advancing into the sea, steep and

<P>shadowless under the clear, light of the early morning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The bottom of the canoe grated upon the sand as the little craft

<P>ran upon the beach.&nbsp; Ali leaped on shore and held on while Dain

<P>stepped out carrying Nina in his arms, exhausted by the events

<P>and the long travelling during the night.&nbsp; Almayer was the last

<P>to leave the boat, and together with Ali ran it higher up on the

<P>beach.&nbsp; Then Ali, tired out by the long paddling, laid down in

<P>the shade of the canoe, and incontinently fell asleep.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>sat sideways on the gunwale, and with his arms crossed on his

<P>breast, looked to the southward upon the sea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After carefully laying Nina down in the shade of the bushes

<P>growing in the middle of the islet, Dain threw himself beside her

<P>and watched in silent concern the tears that ran down from under

<P>her closed eyelids, and lost themselves in that fine sand upon

<P>which they both were lying face to face.&nbsp; These tears and this

<P>sorrow were for him a profound and disquieting mystery.&nbsp; Now,

<P>when the danger was past, why should she grieve?&nbsp; He doubted her

<P>love no more than he would have doubted the fact of his own

<P>existence, but as he lay looking ardently in her face, watching

<P>her tears, her parted lips, her very breath, he was uneasily

<P>conscious of something in her he could not understand.&nbsp; Doubtless

<P>she had the wisdom of perfect beings.&nbsp; He sighed.&nbsp; He felt

<P>something invisible that stood between them, something that would

<P>let him approach her so far, but no farther.&nbsp; No desire, no

<P>longing, no effort of will or length of life could destroy this

<P>vague feeling of their difference.&nbsp; With awe but also with great

<P>pride he concluded that it was her own incomparable perfection.

<P>She was his, and yet she was like a woman from another world.

<P>His!&nbsp; His!&nbsp; He exulted in the glorious thought; nevertheless
her

<P>tears pained him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a wisp of her own hair which he took in his hand with timid

<P>reverence he tried in an access of clumsy tenderness to dry the

<P>tears that trembled on her eyelashes.&nbsp; He had his reward in a

<P>fleeting smile that brightened her face for the short fraction of

<P>a second, but soon the tears fell faster than ever, and he could

<P>bear it no more.&nbsp; He rose and walked towards Almayer, who still

<P>sat absorbed in his contemplation of the sea.&nbsp; It was a very,

<P>very long time since he had seen the sea--that sea that leads

<P>everywhere, brings everything, and takes away so much.&nbsp; He had

<P>almost forgotten why he was there, and dreamily he could see all

<P>his past life on the smooth and boundless surface that glittered

<P>before his eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dain's hand laid on Almayer's shoulder recalled him with a start

<P>from some country very far away indeed.&nbsp; He turned round, but his

<P>eyes seemed to look rather at the place where Dain stood than at

<P>the man himself.&nbsp; Dain felt uneasy under the unconscious gaze.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?" said Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is crying," murmured Dain, softly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She is crying!&nbsp; Why?" asked Almayer, indifferently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I came to ask you.&nbsp; My Ranee smiles when looking at the man she

<P>loves.&nbsp; It is the white woman that is crying now.&nbsp; You would

<P>know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer shrugged his shoulders and turned away again towards the

<P>sea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go, Tuan Putih," urged Dain.&nbsp; "Go to her; her tears are more

<P>terrible to me than the anger of gods."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are they?&nbsp; You will see them more than once.&nbsp; She told me
she

<P>could not live without you," answered Almayer, speaking without

<P>the faintest spark of expression in his face, "so it behoves you

<P>to go to her quick, for fear you may find her dead."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He burst into a loud and unpleasant laugh which made Dain stare

<P>at him with some apprehension, but got off the gunwale of the

<P>boat and moved slowly towards Nina, glancing up at the sun as he

<P>walked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And you go when the sun is overhead?" he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Tuan.&nbsp; Then we go," answered Dain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have not long to wait," muttered Almayer.&nbsp; "It is most

<P>important for me to see you go.&nbsp; Both of you.&nbsp; Most important,"

<P>he repeated, stopping short and looking at Dain fixedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went on again towards Nina, and Dain remained behind.&nbsp; Almayer

<P>approached his daughter and stood for a time looking down on her.

<P>She did not open her eyes, but hearing footsteps near her,

<P>murmured in a low sob, "Dain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer hesitated for a minute and then sank on the sand by her

<P>side.&nbsp; She, not hearing a responsive word, not feeling a touch,

<P>opened her eyes--saw her father, and sat up suddenly with a

<P>movement of terror.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, father!" she murmured faintly, and in that word there was

<P>expressed regret and fear and dawning hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall never forgive you, Nina," said Almayer, in a

<P>dispassionate voice.&nbsp; "You have torn my heart from me while I

<P>dreamt of your happiness.&nbsp; You have deceived me.&nbsp; Your eyes
that

<P>for me were like truth itself lied to me in every glance--for how

<P>long?&nbsp; You know that best.&nbsp; When you were caressing my cheek
you

<P>were counting the minutes to the sunset that was the signal for

<P>your meeting with that man--there!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ceased, and they both sat silent side by side, not looking at

<P>each other, but gazing at the vast expanse of the sea.&nbsp; Almayer's

<P>words had dried Nina's tears, and her look grew hard as she

<P>stared before her into the limitless sheet of blue that shone

<P>limpid, unwaving, and steady like heaven itself.&nbsp; He looked at
it

<P>also, but his features had lost all expression, and life in his

<P>eyes seemed to have gone out.&nbsp; The face was a blank, without a

<P>sign of emotion, feeling, reason, or even knowledge of itself.

<P>All passion, regret, grief, hope, or anger--all were gone, erased

<P>by the hand of fate, as if after this last stroke everything was

<P>over and there was no need for any record.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Those few who saw Almayer during the short period of his

<P>remaining days were always impressed by the sight of that face

<P>that seemed to know nothing of what went on within: like the

<P>blank wall of a prison enclosing sin, regrets, and pain, and

<P>wasted life, in the cold indifference of mortar and stones.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is there to forgive?" asked Nina, not addressing Almayer

<P>directly, but more as if arguing with herself.&nbsp; "Can I not live

<P>my own life as you have lived yours?&nbsp; The path you would have

<P>wished me to follow has been closed to me by no fault of mine."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You never told me," muttered Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You never asked me," she answered, "and I thought you were like

<P>the others and did not care.&nbsp; I bore the memory of my humiliation

<P>alone, and why should I tell you that it came to me because I am

<P>your daughter?&nbsp; I knew you could not avenge me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And yet I was thinking of that only," interrupted Almayer, "and

<P>I wanted to give you years of happiness for the short day of your

<P>suffering.&nbsp; I only knew of one way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! but it was not my way!" she replied.&nbsp; "Could you give me

<P>happiness without life?&nbsp; Life!" she repeated with sudden energy

<P>that sent the word ringing over the sea.&nbsp; "Life that means power

<P>and love," she added in a low voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That!" said Almayer, pointing his finger at Dain standing close

<P>by and looking at them in curious wonder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, that!" she replied, looking her father full in the face and

<P>noticing for the first time with a slight gasp of fear the

<P>unnatural rigidity of his features.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would have rather strangled you with my own hands," said

<P>Almayer, in an expressionless voice which was such a contrast to

<P>the desperate bitterness of his feelings that it surprised even

<P>himself.&nbsp; He asked himself who spoke, and, after looking slowly

<P>round as if expecting to see somebody, turned again his eyes

<P>towards the sea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You say that because you do not understand the meaning of my

<P>words," she said sadly.&nbsp; "Between you and my mother there never

<P>was any love.&nbsp; When I returned to Sambir I found the place which

<P>I thought would be a peaceful refuge for my heart, filled with

<P>weariness and hatred--and mutual contempt.&nbsp; I have listened to

<P>your voice and to her voice.&nbsp; Then I saw that you could not

<P>understand me; for was I not part of that woman?&nbsp; Of her who was

<P>the regret and shame of your life?&nbsp; I had to choose--I hesitated.

<P>Why were you so blind?&nbsp; Did you not see me struggling before your

<P>eyes?&nbsp; But, when he came, all doubt disappeared, and I saw only

<P>the light of the blue and cloudless heaven--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will tell you the rest," interrupted Almayer:&nbsp; "when that man

<P>came I also saw the blue and the sunshine of the sky.&nbsp; A

<P>thunderbolt has fallen from that sky, and suddenly all is still

<P>and dark around me for ever.&nbsp; I will never forgive you, Nina; and

<P>to-morrow I shall forget you!&nbsp; I shall never forgive you," he

<P>repeated with mechanical obstinacy while she sat, her head bowed

<P>down as if afraid to look at her father.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To him it seemed of the utmost importance that he should assure

<P>her of his intention of never forgiving.&nbsp; He was convinced that

<P>his faith in her had been the foundation of his hopes, the motive

<P>of his courage, of his determination to live and struggle, and to

<P>be victorious for her sake.&nbsp; And now his faith was gone,

<P>destroyed by her own hands; destroyed cruelly, treacherously, in

<P>the dark; in the very moment of success.&nbsp; In the utter wreck of

<P>his affections and of all his feelings, in the chaotic disorder

<P>of his thoughts, above the confused sensation of physical pain

<P>that wrapped him up in a sting as of a whiplash curling round him

<P>from his shoulders down to his feet, only one idea remained clear

<P>and definite--not to forgive her; only one vivid desire--to

<P>forget her.&nbsp; And this must be made clear to her--and to

<P>himself--by frequent repetition.&nbsp; That was his idea of his duty

<P>to himself--to his race--to his respectable connections; to the

<P>whole universe unsettled and shaken by this frightful catastrophe

<P>of his life.&nbsp; He saw it clearly and believed he was a strong man.

<P>He had always prided himself upon his unflinching firmness.&nbsp; And

<P>yet he was afraid.&nbsp; She had been all in all to him.&nbsp; What
if he

<P>should let the memory of his love for her weaken the sense of his

<P>dignity?&nbsp; She was a remarkable woman; he could see that; all the

<P>latent greatness of his nature--in which he honestly

<P>believed--had been transfused into that slight, girlish figure.

<P>Great things could be done!&nbsp; What if he should suddenly take her

<P>to his heart, forget his shame, and pain, and anger, and--follow

<P>her!&nbsp; What if he changed his heart if not his skin and made her

<P>life easier between the two loves that would guard her from any

<P>mischance!&nbsp; His heart yearned for her.&nbsp; What if he should
say

<P>that his love for her was greater than . . .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will never forgive you, Nina!" he shouted, leaping up madly in

<P>the sudden fear of his dream.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was the last time in his life that he was heard to raise his

<P>voice.&nbsp; Henceforth he spoke always in a monotonous whisper like

<P>an instrument of which all the strings but one are broken in a

<P>last ringing clamour under a heavy blow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She rose to her feet and looked at him.&nbsp; The very violence of his

<P>cry soothed her in an intuitive conviction of his love, and she

<P>hugged to her breast the lamentable remnants of that affection

<P>with the unscrupulous greediness of women who cling desperately

<P>to the very scraps and rags of love, any kind of love, as a thing

<P>that of right belongs to them and is the very breath of their

<P>life.&nbsp; She put both her hands on Almayer's shoulders, and looking

<P>at him half tenderly, half playfully, she said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You speak so because you love me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer shook his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, you do," she insisted softly; then after a short pause she

<P>added, "and you will never forget me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer shivered slightly.&nbsp; She could not have said a more cruel

<P>thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here is the boat coming now," said Dain, his arm outstretched

<P>towards a black speck on the water between the coast and the

<P>islet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They all looked at it and remained standing in silence till the

<P>little canoe came gently on the beach and a man landed and walked

<P>towards them.&nbsp; He stopped some distance off and hesitated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What news?" asked Dain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have had orders secretly and in the night to take off from

<P>this islet a man and a woman.&nbsp; I see the woman.&nbsp; Which of
you is

<P>the man?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come, delight of my eyes," said Dain to Nina.&nbsp; "Now we go, and

<P>your voice shall be for my ears only.&nbsp; You have spoken your last

<P>words to the Tuan Putih, your father.&nbsp; Come."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She hesitated for a while, looking at Almayer, who kept his eyes

<P>steadily on the sea, then she touched his forehead in a lingering

<P>kiss, and a tear--one of her tears--fell on his cheek and ran

<P>down his immovable face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Goodbye," she whispered, and remained irresolute till he pushed

<P>her suddenly into Dain's arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you have any pity for me," murmured Almayer, as if repeating

<P>some sentence learned by heart, "take that woman away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stood very straight, his shoulders thrown back, his head held

<P>high, and looked at them as they went down the beach to the

<P>canoe, walking enlaced in each other's arms.&nbsp; He looked at the

<P>line of their footsteps marked in the sand.&nbsp; He followed their

<P>figures moving in the crude blaze of the vertical sun, in that

<P>light violent and vibrating, like a triumphal flourish of brazen

<P>trumpets.&nbsp; He looked at the man's brown shoulders, at the red

<P>sarong round his waist; at the tall, slender, dazzling white

<P>figure he supported.&nbsp; He looked at the white dress, at the

<P>falling masses of the long black hair.&nbsp; He looked at them

<P>embarking, and at the canoe growing smaller in the distance, with

<P>rage, despair, and regret in his heart, and on his face a peace

<P>as that of a carved image of oblivion.&nbsp; Inwardly he felt himself

<P>torn to pieces, but Ali--who now aroused--stood close to his

<P>master, saw on his features the blank expression of those who

<P>live in that hopeless calm which sightless eyes only can give.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The canoe disappeared, and Almayer stood motionless with his eyes

<P>fixed on its wake.&nbsp; Ali from under the shade of his hand examined

<P>the coast curiously.&nbsp; As the sun declined, the sea-breeze sprang

<P>up from the northward and shivered with its breath the glassy

<P>surface of the water.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dapat!" exclaimed Ali, joyously.&nbsp; "Got him, master!&nbsp; Got
prau!

<P>Not there!&nbsp; Look more Tanah Mirrah side.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; That
way!

<P>Master, see?&nbsp; Now plain.&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer followed Ali's forefinger with his eyes for a long time

<P>in vain.&nbsp; At last he sighted a triangular patch of yellow light

<P>on the red background of the cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah.&nbsp; It was

<P>the sail of the prau that had caught the sunlight and stood out,

<P>distinct with its gay tint, on the dark red of the cape.&nbsp; The

<P>yellow triangle crept slowly from cliff to cliff, till it cleared

<P>the last point of land and shone brilliantly for a fleeting

<P>minute on the blue of the open sea.&nbsp; Then the prau bore up to the

<P>southward: the light went out of the sail, and all at once the

<P>vessel itself disappeared, vanishing in the shadow of the steep

<P>headland that looked on, patient and lonely, watching over the

<P>empty sea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer never moved.&nbsp; Round the little islet the air was full of

<P>the talk of the rippling water.&nbsp; The crested wavelets ran up the

<P>beach audaciously, joyously, with the lightness of young life,

<P>and died quickly, unresistingly, and graciously, in the wide

<P>curves of transparent foam on the yellow sand.&nbsp; Above, the white

<P>clouds sailed rapidly southwards as if intent upon overtaking

<P>something.&nbsp; Ali seemed anxious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Master," he said timidly, "time to get house now.&nbsp; Long way off

<P>to pull.&nbsp; All ready, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wait," whispered Almayer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now she was gone his business was to forget, and he had a strange

<P>notion that it should be done systematically and in order.&nbsp; To

<P>Ali's great dismay he fell on his hands and knees, and, creeping

<P>along the sand, erased carefully with his hand all traces of

<P>Nina's footsteps.&nbsp; He piled up small heaps of sand, leaving

<P>behind him a line of miniature graves right down to the water.

<P>After burying the last slight imprint of Nina's slipper he stood

<P>up, and, turning his face towards the headland where he had last

<P>seen the prau, he made an effort to shout out loud again his firm

<P>resolve to never forgive.&nbsp; Ali watching him uneasily saw only his

<P>lips move, but heard no sound.&nbsp; He brought his foot down with a

<P>stamp.&nbsp; He was a firm man--firm as a rock.&nbsp; Let her go.&nbsp;
He never

<P>had a daughter.&nbsp; He would forget.&nbsp; He was forgetting already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ali approached him again, insisting on immediate departure, and

<P>this time he consented, and they went together towards their

<P>canoe, Almayer leading.&nbsp; For all his firmness he looked very

<P>dejected and feeble as he dragged his feet slowly through the

<P>sand on the beach; and by his side--invisible to Ali--stalked

<P>that particular fiend whose mission it is to jog the memories of

<P>men, lest they should forget the meaning of life.&nbsp; He whispered

<P>into Almayer's ear a childish prattle of many years ago.

<P>Almayer, his head bent on one side, seemed to listen to his

<P>invisible companion, but his face was like the face of a man that

<P>has died struck from behind--a face from which all feelings and

<P>all expression are suddenly wiped off by the hand of unexpected

<P>death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They slept on the river that night, mooring their canoe under the

<P>bushes and lying down in the bottom side by side, in the absolute

<P>exhaustion that kills hunger, thirst, all feeling and all thought

<P>in the overpowering desire for that deep sleep which is like the

<P>temporary annihilation of the tired body.&nbsp; Next day they started

<P>again and fought doggedly with the current all the morning, till

<P>about midday they reached the settlement and made fast their

<P>little craft to the jetty of Lingard and Co.&nbsp; Almayer walked

<P>straight to the house, and Ali followed, paddles on shoulder,

<P>thinking that he would like to eat something.&nbsp; As they crossed

<P>the front courtyard they noticed the abandoned look of the place.

<P>Ali looked in at the different servants' houses: all were empty.

<P>In the back courtyard there was the same absence of sound and

<P>life.&nbsp; In the cooking-shed the fire was out and the black embers

<P>were cold.&nbsp; A tall, lean man came stealthily out of the banana

<P>plantation, and went away rapidly across the open space looking

<P>at them with big, frightened eyes over his shoulder.&nbsp; Some

<P>vagabond without a master; there were many such in the

<P>settlement, and they looked upon Almayer as their patron.&nbsp; They

<P>prowled about his premises and picked their living there, sure

<P>that nothing worse could befall them than a shower of curses when

<P>they got in the way of the white man, whom they trusted and

<P>liked, and called a fool amongst themselves.&nbsp; In the house, which

<P>Almayer entered through the back verandah, the only living thing

<P>that met his eyes was his small monkey which, hungry and

<P>unnoticed for the last two days, began to cry and complain in

<P>monkey language as soon as it caught sight of the familiar face.

<P>Almayer soothed it with a few words and ordered Ali to bring in

<P>some bananas, then while Ali was gone to get them he stood in the

<P>doorway of the front verandah looking at the chaos of overturned

<P>furniture.&nbsp; Finally he picked up the table and sat on it while

<P>the monkey let itself down from the roof-stick by its chain and

<P>perched on his shoulder.&nbsp; When the bananas came they had their

<P>breakfast together; both hungry, both eating greedily and

<P>showering the skins round them recklessly, in the trusting

<P>silence of perfect friendship.&nbsp; Ali went away, grumbling, to cook

<P>some rice himself, for all the women about the house had

<P>disappeared; he did not know where.&nbsp; Almayer did not seem to

<P>care, and, after he finished eating, he sat on the table swinging

<P>his legs and staring at the river as if lost in thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After some time he got up and went to the door of a room on the

<P>right of the verandah.&nbsp; That was the office.&nbsp; The office of

<P>Lingard and Co.&nbsp; He very seldom went in there.&nbsp; There was
no

<P>business now, and he did not want an office.&nbsp; The door was

<P>locked, and he stood biting his lower lip, trying to think of the

<P>place where the key could be.&nbsp; Suddenly he remembered:&nbsp; in
the

<P>women's room hung upon a nail.&nbsp; He went over to the doorway where

<P>the red curtain hung down in motionless folds, and hesitated for

<P>a moment before pushing it aside with his shoulder as if breaking

<P>down some solid obstacle.&nbsp; A great square of sunshine entering

<P>through the window lay on the floor.&nbsp; On the left he saw Mrs.

<P>Almayer's big wooden chest, the lid thrown back, empty; near it

<P>the brass nails of Nina's European trunk shone in the large

<P>initials N. A. on the cover.&nbsp; A few of Nina's dresses hung on

<P>wooden pegs, stiffened in a look of offended dignity at their

<P>abandonment.&nbsp; He remembered making the pegs himself and noticed

<P>that they were very good pegs.&nbsp; Where was the key?&nbsp; He looked

<P>round and saw it near the door where he stood.&nbsp; It was red with

<P>rust.&nbsp; He felt very much annoyed at that, and directly afterwards

<P>wondered at his own feeling.&nbsp; What did it matter?&nbsp; There soon

<P>would be no key--no door--nothing!&nbsp; He paused, key in hand, and

<P>asked himself whether he knew well what he was about.&nbsp; He went

<P>out again on the verandah and stood by the table thinking.&nbsp; The

<P>monkey jumped down, and, snatching a banana skin, absorbed itself

<P>in picking it to shreds industriously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Forget!" muttered Almayer, and that word started before him a

<P>sequence of events, a detailed programme of things to do.&nbsp; He

<P>knew perfectly well what was to be done now.&nbsp; First this, then

<P>that, and then forgetfulness would come easy.&nbsp; Very easy.&nbsp;
He had

<P>a fixed idea that if he should not forget before he died he would

<P>have to remember to all eternity.&nbsp; Certain things had to be taken

<P>out of his life, stamped out of sight, destroyed, forgotten.&nbsp; For

<P>a long time he stood in deep thought, lost in the alarming

<P>possibilities of unconquerable memory, with the fear of death and

<P>eternity before him.&nbsp; "Eternity!" he said aloud, and the sound
of

<P>that word recalled him out of his reverie.&nbsp; The monkey started,

<P>dropped the skin, and grinned up at him amicably.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went towards the office door and with some difficulty managed

<P>to open it.&nbsp; He entered in a cloud of dust that rose under his

<P>feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Books open with torn pages bestrewed the floor; other books lay

<P>about grimy and black, looking as if they had never been opened.

<P>Account books.&nbsp; In those books he had intended to keep day by day

<P>a record of his rising fortunes.&nbsp; Long time ago.&nbsp; A very long

<P>time.&nbsp; For many years there has been no record to keep on the

<P>blue and red ruled pages!&nbsp; In the middle of the room the big

<P>office desk, with one of its legs broken, careened over like the

<P>hull of a stranded ship; most of the drawers had fallen out,

<P>disclosing heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt.&nbsp; The

<P>revolving office chair stood in its place, but he found the pivot

<P>set fast when he tried to turn it.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; He desisted,
and

<P>his eyes wandered slowly from object to object.&nbsp; All those things

<P>had cost a lot of money at the time.&nbsp; The desk, the paper, the

<P>torn books, and the broken shelves, all under a thick coat of

<P>dust.&nbsp; The very dust and bones of a dead and gone business.&nbsp;
He

<P>looked at all these things, all that was left after so many years

<P>of work, of strife, of weariness, of discouragement, conquered so

<P>many times.&nbsp; And all for what?&nbsp; He stood thinking mournfully
of

<P>his past life till he heard distinctly the clear voice of a child

<P>speaking amongst all this wreck, ruin, and waste.&nbsp; He started

<P>with a great fear in his heart, and feverishly began to rake in

<P>the papers scattered on the floor, broke the chair into bits,

<P>splintered the drawers by banging them against the desk, and made

<P>a big heap of all that rubbish in one corner of the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He came out quickly, slammed the door after him, turned the key,

<P>and, taking it out, ran to the front rail of the verandah, and,

<P>with a great swing of his arm, sent the key whizzing into the

<P>river.&nbsp; This done he went back slowly to the table, called the

<P>monkey down, unhooked its chain, and induced it to remain quiet

<P>in the breast of his jacket.&nbsp; Then he sat again on the table and

<P>looked fixedly at the door of the room he had just left.&nbsp; He

<P>listened also intently.&nbsp; He heard a dry sound of rustling; sharp

<P>cracks as of dry wood snapping; a whirr like of a bird's wings

<P>when it rises suddenly, and then he saw a thin stream of smoke

<P>come through the keyhole.&nbsp; The monkey struggled under his coat.

<P>Ali appeared with his eyes starting out of his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Master! House burn!" he shouted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer stood up holding by the table.&nbsp; He could hear the yells

<P>of alarm and surprise in the settlement.&nbsp; Ali wrung his hands,

<P>lamenting aloud.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop this noise, fool!" said Almayer, quietly.&nbsp; "Pick up my

<P>hammock and blankets and take them to the other house.&nbsp; Quick,

<P>now!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The smoke burst through the crevices of the door, and Ali, with

<P>the hammock in his arms, cleared in one bound the steps of the

<P>verandah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It has caught well," muttered Almayer to himself.&nbsp; "Be quiet,

<P>Jack," he added, as the monkey made a frantic effort to escape

<P>from its confinement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The door split from top to bottom, and a rush of flame and smoke

<P>drove Almayer away from the table to the front rail of the

<P>verandah.&nbsp; He held on there till a great roar overhead assured

<P>him that the roof was ablaze.&nbsp; Then he ran down the steps of the

<P>verandah, coughing, half choked with the smoke that pursued him

<P>in bluish wreaths curling about his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the other side of the ditch, separating Almayer's courtyard

<P>from the settlement, a crowd of the inhabitants of Sambir looked

<P>at the burning house of the white man.&nbsp; In the calm air the

<P>flames rushed up on high, coloured pale brick-red, with violet

<P>gleams in the strong sunshine.&nbsp; The thin column of smoke ascended

<P>straight and unwavering till it lost itself in the clear blue of

<P>the sky, and, in the great empty space between the two houses the

<P>interested spectators could see the tall figure of the Tuan

<P>Putih, with bowed head and dragging feet, walking slowly away

<P>from the fire towards the shelter of "Almayer's Folly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In that manner did Almayer move into his new house.&nbsp; He took

<P>possession of the new ruin, and in the undying folly of his heart

<P>set himself to wait in anxiety and pain for that forgetfulness

<P>which was so slow to come.&nbsp; He had done all he could.&nbsp; Every

<P>vestige of Nina's existence had been destroyed; and now with

<P>every sunrise he asked himself whether the longed-for oblivion

<P>would come before sunset, whether it would come before he died?

<P>He wanted to live only long enough to be able to forget, and the

<P>tenacity of his memory filled him with dread and horror of death;

<P>for should it come before he could accomplish the purpose of his

<P>life he would have to remember for ever!&nbsp; He also longed for

<P>loneliness.&nbsp; He wanted to be alone.&nbsp; But he was not.&nbsp;
In the dim

<P>light of the rooms with their closed shutters, in the bright

<P>sunshine of the verandah, wherever he went, whichever way he

<P>turned, he saw the small figure of a little maiden with pretty

<P>olive face, with long black hair, her little pink robe slipping

<P>off her shoulders, her big eyes looking up at him in the tender

<P>trustfulness of a petted child.&nbsp; Ali did not see anything, but
he

<P>also was aware of the presence of a child in the house.&nbsp; In his

<P>long talks by the evening fires of the settlement he used to tell

<P>his intimate friends of Almayer's strange doings.&nbsp; His master had

<P>turned sorcerer in his old age.&nbsp; Ali said that often when Tuan

<P>Putih had retired for the night he could hear him talking to

<P>something in his room.&nbsp; Ali thought that it was a spirit in the

<P>shape of a child.&nbsp; He knew his master spoke to a child from

<P>certain expressions and words his master used.&nbsp; His master spoke

<P>in Malay a little, but mostly in English, which he, Ali, could

<P>understand.&nbsp; Master spoke to the child at times tenderly, then
he

<P>would weep over it, laugh at it, scold it, beg of it to go away;

<P>curse it.&nbsp; It was a bad and stubborn spirit.&nbsp; Ali thought
his

<P>master had imprudently called it up, and now could not get rid of

<P>it.&nbsp; His master was very brave; he was not afraid to curse this

<P>spirit in the very Presence; and once he fought with it.&nbsp; Ali had

<P>heard a great noise as of running about inside the room and

<P>groans.&nbsp; His master groaned.&nbsp; Spirits do not groan.&nbsp;
His master

<P>was brave, but foolish.&nbsp; You cannot hurt a spirit.&nbsp; Ali expected

<P>to find his master dead next morning, but he came out very early,

<P>looking much older than the day before, and had no food all day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So far Ali to the settlement.&nbsp; To Captain Ford he was much more

<P>communicative, for the good reason that Captain Ford had the

<P>purse and gave orders.&nbsp; On each of Ford's monthly visits to

<P>Sambir Ali had to go on board with a report about the inhabitant

<P>of "Almayer's Folly."&nbsp; On his first visit to Sambir, after Nina's

<P>departure, Ford had taken charge of Almayer's affairs.&nbsp; They were

<P>not cumbersome.&nbsp; The shed for the storage of goods was empty, the

<P>boats had disappeared, appropriated--generally in night-time--by

<P>various citizens of Sambir in need of means of transport.&nbsp; During

<P>a great flood the jetty of Lingard and Co. left the bank and

<P>floated down the river, probably in search of more cheerful

<P>surroundings; even the flock of geese--"the only geese on the

<P>east coast"--departed somewhere, preferring the unknown dangers

<P>of the bush to the desolation of their old home.&nbsp; As time went
on

<P>the grass grew over the black patch of ground where the old house

<P>used to stand, and nothing remained to mark the place of the

<P>dwelling that had sheltered Almayer's young hopes, his foolish

<P>dream of splendid future, his awakening, and his despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ford did not often visit Almayer, for visiting Almayer was not a

<P>pleasant task.&nbsp; At first he used to respond listlessly to the old

<P>seaman's boisterous inquiries about his health; he even made

<P>efforts to talk, asking for news in a voice that made it

<P>perfectly clear that no news from this world had any interest for

<P>him.&nbsp; Then gradually he became more silent--not sulkily--but as

<P>if he was forgetting how to speak.&nbsp; He used also to hide in the

<P>darkest rooms of the house, where Ford had to seek him out guided

<P>by the patter of the monkey galloping before him.&nbsp; The monkey was

<P>always there to receive and introduce Ford.&nbsp; The little animal

<P>seemed to have taken complete charge of its master, and whenever

<P>it wished for his presence on the verandah it would tug

<P>perseveringly at his jacket, till Almayer obediently came out

<P>into the sunshine, which he seemed to dislike so much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One morning Ford found him sitting on the floor of the verandah,

<P>his back against the wall, his legs stretched stiffly out, his

<P>arms hanging by his side.&nbsp; His expressionless face, his eyes open

<P>wide with immobile pupils, and the rigidity of his pose, made him

<P>look like an immense man-doll broken and flung there out of the

<P>way.&nbsp; As Ford came up the steps he turned his head slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ford," he murmured from the floor, "I cannot forget."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can't you?" said Ford, innocently, with an attempt at joviality:

<P>"I wish I was like you.&nbsp; I am losing my memory--age, I suppose;

<P>only the other day my mate--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopped, for Almayer had got up, stumbled, and steadied

<P>himself on his friend's arm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hallo! You are better to-day.&nbsp; Soon be all right," said Ford,

<P>cheerfully, but feeling rather scared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almayer let go his arm and stood very straight with his head up

<P>and shoulders thrown back, looking stonily at the multitude of

<P>suns shining in ripples of the river.&nbsp; His jacket and his loose

<P>trousers flapped in the breeze on his thin limbs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let her go!" he whispered in a grating voice.&nbsp; "Let her go.&nbsp;
To-

<P>morrow I shall forget.&nbsp; I am a firm man, . . . firm as a . . .

<P>rock, .&nbsp; . . firm . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ford looked at his face--and fled.&nbsp; The skipper was a tolerably

<P>firm man himself--as those who had sailed with him could testify-

<P>-but Almayer's firmness was altogether too much for his

<P>fortitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Next time the steamer called in Sambir Ali came on board early

<P>with a grievance.&nbsp; He complained to Ford that Jim-Eng the

<P>Chinaman had invaded Almayer's house, and actually had lived

<P>there for the last month.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And they both smoke," added Ali.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Phew! Opium, you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ali nodded, and Ford remained thoughtful; then he muttered to

<P>himself, "Poor devil! The sooner the better now."&nbsp; In the

<P>afternoon he walked up to the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you doing here?" he asked of Jim-Eng, whom he found

<P>strolling about on the verandah.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jim-Eng explained in bad Malay, and speaking in that monotonous,

<P>uninterested voice of an opium smoker pretty far gone, that his

<P>house was old, the roof leaked, and the floor was rotten.&nbsp; So,

<P>being an old friend for many, many years, he took his money, his

<P>opium, and two pipes, and came to live in this big house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is plenty of room.&nbsp; He smokes, and I live here.&nbsp; He
will

<P>not smoke long," he concluded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where is he now?" asked Ford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Inside.&nbsp; He sleeps," answered Jim-Eng, wearily.&nbsp; Ford glanced
in

<P>through the doorway.&nbsp; In the dim light of the room he could see

<P>Almayer lying on his back on the floor, his head on a wooden

<P>pillow, the long white beard scattered over his breast, the

<P>yellow skin of the face, the half-closed eyelids showing the

<P>whites of the eye only. . .&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He shuddered and turned away.&nbsp; As he was leaving he noticed a

<P>long strip of faded red silk, with some Chinese letters on it,

<P>which Jim-Eng had just fastened to one of the pillars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's that?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That," said Jim-Eng, in his colourless voice, "that is the name

<P>of the house.&nbsp; All the same like my house.&nbsp; Very good name."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ford looked at him for awhile and went away.&nbsp; He did not know

<P>what the crazy-looking maze of the Chinese inscription on the red

<P>silk meant.&nbsp; Had he asked Jim-Eng, that patient Chinaman would

<P>have informed him with proper pride that its meaning was: "House

<P>of heavenly delight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the evening of the same day Babalatchi called on Captain Ford.

<P>The captain's cabin opened on deck, and Babalatchi sat astride on

<P>the high step, while Ford smoked his pipe on the settee inside.

<P>The steamer was leaving next morning, and the old statesman came

<P>as usual for a last chat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had news from Bali last moon," remarked Babalatchi.&nbsp; "A

<P>grandson is born to the old Rajah, and there is great rejoicing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ford sat up interested.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," went on Babalatchi, in answer to Ford's look.&nbsp; "I told

<P>him.&nbsp; That was before he began to smoke."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, and what?" asked Ford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I escaped with my life," said Babalatchi, with perfect gravity,

<P>"because the white man is very weak and fell as he rushed upon

<P>me."&nbsp; Then, after a pause, he added, "She is mad with joy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mrs. Almayer, you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, she lives in our Rajah's house.&nbsp; She will not die soon.

<P>Such women live a long time," said Babalatchi, with a slight

<P>tinge of regret in his voice.&nbsp; "She has dollars, and she has

<P>buried them, but we know where.&nbsp; We had much trouble with those

<P>people.&nbsp; We had to pay a fine and listen to threats from the

<P>white men, and now we have to be careful."&nbsp; He sighed and

<P>remained silent for a long while.&nbsp; Then with energy:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There will be fighting.&nbsp; There is a breath of war on the

<P>islands.&nbsp; Shall I live long enough to see? . . . Ah, Tuan!" he

<P>went on, more quietly, "the old times were best.&nbsp; Even I have

<P>sailed with Lanun men, and boarded in the night silent ships with

<P>white sails.&nbsp; That was before an English Rajah ruled in Kuching.

<P>Then we fought amongst ourselves and were happy.&nbsp; Now when we

<P>fight with you we can only die!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He rose to go.&nbsp; "Tuan," he said, "you remember the girl that man

<P>Bulangi had?&nbsp; Her that caused all the trouble?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Ford.&nbsp; "What of her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She grew thin and could not work.&nbsp; Then Bulangi, who is a thief

<P>and a pig-eater, gave her to me for fifty dollars.&nbsp; I sent her

<P>amongst my women to grow fat.&nbsp; I wanted to hear the sound of her

<P>laughter, but she must have been bewitched, and . . . she died

<P>two days ago.&nbsp; Nay, Tuan.&nbsp; Why do you speak bad words?&nbsp;
I am

<P>old--that is true--but why should I not like the sight of a young

<P>face and the sound of a young voice in my house?"&nbsp; He paused, and

<P>then added with a little mournful laugh, "I am like a white man

<P>talking too much of what is not men's talk when they speak to one

<P>another."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And he went off looking very sad.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The crowd massed in a semicircle before the steps of "Almayer's

<P>Folly," swayed silently backwards and forwards, and opened out

<P>before the group of white-robed and turbaned men advancing

<P>through the grass towards the house.&nbsp; Abdulla walked first,

<P>supported by Reshid and followed by all the Arabs in Sambir.&nbsp; As

<P>they entered the lane made by the respectful throng there was a

<P>subdued murmur of voices, where the word "Mati" was the only one

<P>distinctly audible.&nbsp; Abdulla stopped and looked round slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is he dead?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May you live!" answered the crowd in one shout, and then there

<P>succeeded a breathless silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Abdulla made a few paces forward and found himself for the last

<P>time face to face with his old enemy.&nbsp; Whatever he might have

<P>been once he was not dangerous now, lying stiff and lifeless in

<P>the tender light of the early day.&nbsp; The only white man on the

<P>east coast was dead, and his soul, delivered from the trammels of

<P>his earthly folly, stood now in the presence of Infinite Wisdom.

<P>On the upturned face there was that serene look which follows the

<P>sudden relief from anguish and pain, and it testified silently

<P>before the cloudless heaven that the man lying there under the

<P>gaze of indifferent eyes had been permitted to forget before he

<P>died.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Abdulla looked down sadly at this Infidel he had fought so long

<P>and had bested so many times.&nbsp; Such was the reward of the

<P>Faithful!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yet in the Arab's old heart there was a feeling of regret for

<P>that thing gone out of his life.&nbsp; He was leaving fast behind him

<P>friendships, and enmities, successes, and disappointments--all

<P>that makes up a life; and before him was only the end.&nbsp; Prayer

<P>would fill up the remainder of the days allotted to the True

<P>Believer!&nbsp; He took in his hand the beads that hung at his waist.

<P>"I found him here, like this, in the morning," said Ali, in a low

<P>"Let us go," he said, addressing Reshid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And as they passed through the crowd that fell back before them,

<P>the beads in Abdulla's hand clicked, while in a solemn whisper he

<P>breathed out piously the name of Allah! The Merciful! The Compassionate!
