<P>"One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my

<P>steamboat, I heard voices approaching--and there were

<P>the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank.&nbsp; I

<P>laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost

<P>myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it

<P>were: 'I am as harmless as a little child, but I don't like

<P>to be dictated to.&nbsp; Am I the manager--or am I not?&nbsp; I

<P>was ordered to send him there.&nbsp; It's incredible.' . . .

<P>I became aware that the two were standing on the shore

<P>alongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my

<P>head.&nbsp; I did not move; it did not occur to me to move: I

<P>was sleepy.&nbsp; 'It IS unpleasant,' grunted the uncle.&nbsp; 'He

<P>has asked the Administration to be sent there,' said the

<P>other, 'with the idea of showing what he could do; and

<P>I was instructed accordingly.&nbsp; Look at the influence that

<P>man must have.&nbsp; Is it not frightful?'&nbsp; They both agreed

<P>it was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks:

<P>'Make rain and fine weather--one man--the Council--

<P>by the nose'--bits of absurd sentences that got the

<P>better of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the

<P>whole of my wits about me when the uncle said, 'The

<P>climate may do away with this difficulty for you.&nbsp; Is he

<P>alone there?'&nbsp; 'Yes,' answered the manager; 'he sent

<P>his assistant down the river with a note to me in these

<P>terms: "Clear this poor devil out of the country, and

<P>don't bother sending more of that sort.&nbsp; I had rather

<P>be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of

<P>with me."&nbsp; It was more than a year ago.&nbsp; Can you

<P>imagine such impudence!'&nbsp; 'Anything since then?'

<P>asked the other, hoarsely.&nbsp; 'Ivory,' jerked the nephew;

<P>'lots of it--prime sort--lots--most annoying, from

<P>him.'&nbsp; 'And with that?' questioned the heavy rumble.

<P>'Invoice,' was the reply fired out, so to speak.&nbsp; Then

<P>silence.&nbsp; They had been talking about Kurtz.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly

<P>at ease, remained still, having no inducement to change

<P>my position.&nbsp; 'How did that ivory come all this way?'

<P>growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed.&nbsp; The

<P>other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in

<P>charge of an English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with

<P>him; that Kurtz had apparently intended to return him-

<P>self, the station being by that time bare of goods and

<P>stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had sud-

<P>denly decided to go back, which he started to do alone

<P>in a small dug-out with four paddlers, leaving the half-

<P>caste to continue down the river with the ivory.&nbsp; The two

<P>fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting

<P>such a thing.&nbsp; They were at a loss for an adequate mo-

<P>tive.&nbsp; As to me, I seemed to see Kurtz for the first time.

<P>It was a distinct glimpse: the dug-out, four paddling

<P>savages, and the lone white man turning his back sud-

<P>denly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of

<P>home--perhaps; setting his face towards the depths of

<P>the wilderness, towards his empty and desolate station.

<P>I did not know the motive.&nbsp; Perhaps he was just simply

<P>a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake.&nbsp; His

<P>name, you understand, had not been pronounced once.

<P>He was 'that man.'&nbsp; The half-caste, who, as far as I

<P>could see, had conducted a difficult trip with great pru-

<P>dence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that

<P>scoundrel.'&nbsp; The 'scoundrel' had reported that the

<P>'man' had been very ill--had recovered imperfectly.

<P>. . .&nbsp; The two below me moved away then a few paces,

<P>and strolled back and forth at some little distance.&nbsp; I

<P>heard: 'Military post--doctor--two hundred miles--

<P>quite alone now--unavoidable delays--nine months--no

<P>news--strange rumors.'&nbsp; They approached again, just

<P>as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know,

<P>unless a species of wandering trader--a pestilential fel-

<P>low, snapping ivory from the natives.'&nbsp; Who was it they

<P>were talking about now?&nbsp; I gathered in snatches that

<P>this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and

<P>of whom the manager did not approve.&nbsp; 'We will not be

<P>free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is

<P>hanged for an example,' he said.&nbsp; 'Certainly,' grunted

<P>the other; 'get him hanged!&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Anything--

<P>anything can be done in this country.&nbsp; That's what I

<P>say; nobody here, you understand, HERE, can endanger

<P>your position.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; You stand the climate--you

<P>outlast them all.&nbsp; The danger is in Europe; but there

<P>before I left I took care to--'&nbsp; They moved off and

<P>whispered, then their voices rose again.&nbsp; 'The extraor-

<P>dinary series of delays is not my fault.&nbsp; I did my

<P>possible.'&nbsp; The fat man sighed, 'Very sad.'&nbsp; 'And the

<P>pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other;

<P>'he bothered me enough when he was here.&nbsp; "Each

<P>station should be like a beacon on the road towards better

<P>things, a center for trade of course, but also for human-

<P>izing, improving, instructing."&nbsp; Conceive you--that ass!

<P>And he wants to be manager!&nbsp; No, it's--'&nbsp; Here he

<P>got choked by excessive indignation, and I lifted my

<P>head the least bit.&nbsp; I was surprised to see how near they

<P>were--right under me.&nbsp; I could have spat upon their

<P>hats.&nbsp; They were looking on the ground, absorbed in

<P>thought.&nbsp; The manager was switching his leg with a

<P>slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his head.&nbsp; 'You

<P>have been well since you came out this time?' he asked.

<P>The other gave a start.&nbsp; 'Who?&nbsp; I?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Like a
charm

<P>--like a charm.&nbsp; But the rest--oh, my goodness!&nbsp; All

<P>sick.&nbsp; They die so quick, too, that I haven't the time

<P>to send them out of the country--it's incredible!'&nbsp; 'H'm.

<P>Just so,' grunted the uncle.&nbsp; 'Ah! my boy, trust to this

<P>--I say, trust to this.'&nbsp; I saw him extend his short flipper

<P>of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the

<P>creek, the mud, the river,--seemed to beckon with a dis-

<P>honoring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a

<P>treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden

<P>evil, to the profound darkness of its heart.&nbsp; It was so

<P>startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at

<P>the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an

<P>answer of some sort to that black display of confidence.

<P>You know the foolish notions that come to one some-

<P>times.&nbsp; The high stillness confronted these two figures

<P>with its ominous patience, waiting for the passing away

<P>of a fantastic invasion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They swore aloud together--out of sheer fright, I

<P>believe--then pretending not to know anything of my

<P>existence, turned back to the station.&nbsp; The sun was low;

<P>and leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be

<P>tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows

<P>of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over

<P>the tall grass without bending a single blade.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the

<P>patient wilderness, that closed upon it as the sea closes

<P>over a diver.&nbsp; Long afterwards the news came that all

<P>the donkeys were dead.&nbsp; I know nothing as to the fate of

<P>the less valuable animals.&nbsp; They, no doubt, like the rest

<P>of us, found what they deserved.&nbsp; I did not inquire.&nbsp; I

<P>was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz

<P>very soon.&nbsp; When I say very soon I mean it compara-

<P>tively.&nbsp; It was just two months from the day we left

<P>the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtz's sta-

<P>tion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Going up that river was like traveling back to the

<P>earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted

<P>on the earth and the big trees were kings.&nbsp; An empty

<P>stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest.&nbsp; The air

<P>was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish.&nbsp; There was no joy

<P>in the brilliance of sunshine.&nbsp; The long stretches of the

<P>waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of over-

<P>shadowed distances.&nbsp; On silvery sandbanks hippos and

<P>alligators sunned themselves side by side.&nbsp; The broaden-

<P>ing waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you

<P>lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and

<P>butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the

<P>channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut

<P>off for ever from everything you had known once--some

<P>where--far away--in another existence perhaps.&nbsp; There

<P>were moments when one's past came back to one, as it

<P>will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare

<P>to yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful

<P>and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the

<P>overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants,

<P>and water, and silence.&nbsp; And this stillness of life did

<P>not in the least resemble a peace.&nbsp; It was the stillness of

<P>an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable inten-

<P>tion.&nbsp; It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.&nbsp; I got

<P>used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had

<P>no time.&nbsp; I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had

<P>to discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden

<P>banks; I watched for sunken stones; I was learning to

<P>clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when

<P>I shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would

<P>have ripped the life out of the tin-pot steamboat and

<P>drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a look-out for

<P>the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for

<P>next day's steaming.&nbsp; When you have to attend to

<P>things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the sur-

<P>face, the reality--the reality, I tell you--fades.&nbsp; The

<P>inner truth is hidden--luckily, luckily.&nbsp; But I felt it

<P>all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching

<P>me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows

<P>performing on your respective tight-ropes for--what is

<P>it? half-a-crown a tumble--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Try to be civil, Marlow," growled a voice, and I

<P>knew there was at least one listener awake besides my-

<P>self.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I forgot the heartache which

<P>makes up the rest of the price.&nbsp; And indeed what does

<P>the price matter, if the trick be well done?&nbsp; You do

<P>your tricks very well.&nbsp; And I didn't do badly either,

<P>since I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first

<P>trip.&nbsp; It's a wonder to me yet.&nbsp; Imagine a blindfolded

<P>man set to drive a van over a bad road.&nbsp; I sweated and

<P>shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you.

<P>After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing

<P>that's supposed to float all the time under his care is

<P>the unpardonable sin.&nbsp; No one may know of it, but you

<P>never forget the thump--eh?&nbsp; A blow on the very heart.

<P>You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night

<P>and think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all

<P>over.&nbsp; I don't pretend to say that steamboat floated all

<P>the time.&nbsp; More than once she had to wade for a bit,

<P>with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.

<P>We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a

<P>crew.&nbsp; Fine fellows--cannibals--in their place.&nbsp; They

<P>were men one could work with, and I am grateful to

<P>them.&nbsp; And, after all, they did not each other before

<P>my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-

<P>meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the

<P>wilderness stink in my nostrils.&nbsp; Phoo!&nbsp; I can sniff it

<P>now.&nbsp; I had the manager on board and three or four

<P>pilgrims with their staves--all complete.&nbsp; Sometimes we

<P>came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the

<P>skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out

<P>of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and

<P>surprise and welcome, seemed very strange,--had the ap-

<P>pearance of being held there captive by a spell.&nbsp; The word

<P>ivory would ring in the air for a while--and on we went

<P>again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the

<P>still bends, between the high walls of our winding way,

<P>reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the

<P>stern-wheel.&nbsp; Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive,

<P>immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging

<P>the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed

<P>steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor

<P>of a lofty portico.&nbsp; It made you feel very small, very

<P>lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing that feel-

<P>ing.&nbsp; After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle

<P>crawled on--which was just what you wanted it to do.

<P>Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know.

<P>To some place where they expected to get something, I

<P>bet!&nbsp; For me it crawled toward Kurtz--exclusively; but

<P>when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very

<P>slow.&nbsp; The reaches opened before us and closed behind,

<P>as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water

<P>to bar the way for our return.&nbsp; We penetrated deeper

<P>and deeper into the heart of darkness.&nbsp; It was very quiet

<P>there.&nbsp; At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the

<P>curtain of trees would run up the river and remain

<P>sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our

<P>heads, till the first break of day.&nbsp; Whether it meant war,

<P>peace, or prayer we could not tell.&nbsp; The dawns were

<P>heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the wood-

<P>cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of

<P>a twig would make you start.&nbsp; We were wanderers on

<P>a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect

<P>of an unknown planet.&nbsp; We could have fancied ourselves

<P>the first of men taking possession of an accursed in-

<P>heritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish

<P>and of excessive toil.&nbsp; But suddenly, as we struggled

<P>round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls,

<P>of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black

<P>limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of

<P>bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy

<P>and motionless foliage.&nbsp; The steamer toiled along slowly

<P>on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.&nbsp; The

<P>prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, wel-

<P>coming us--who could tell?&nbsp; We were cut off from the

<P>comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like

<P>phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men

<P>would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.

<P>We could not understand, because we were too far and

<P>could not remember, because we were traveling in the

<P>night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving

<P>hardly a sign--and no memories.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The earth seemed unearthly.&nbsp; We are accustomed to

<P>look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but

<P>there--there you could look at a thing monstrous and

<P>free.&nbsp; It was unearthly, and the men were--&nbsp; No, they

<P>were not inhuman.&nbsp; Well, you know, that was the worst

<P>of it--this suspicion of their not being inhuman.&nbsp; It

<P>would come slowly to one.&nbsp; They howled, and leaped, and

<P>spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was

<P>just the thought of their humanity--like yours--the

<P>thought of your remote kinship with this wild and pas-

<P>sionate uproar.&nbsp; Ugly.&nbsp; Yes, it was ugly enough; but

<P>if you were man enough you would admit to yourself

<P>that there was in you just the faintest trace of a re-

<P>sponse to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim

<P>suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you--

<P>you so remote from the night of first ages--could com-

<P>prehend.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; The mind of man is capable

<P>of anything--because everything is in it, all the past

<P>as well as all the future.&nbsp; What was there after all?

<P>Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valor, rage--who can tell?

<P>--but truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time.&nbsp; Let

<P>the fool gape and shudder--the man knows, and can

<P>look on without a wink.&nbsp; But he must at least be as

<P>much of a man as these on the shore.&nbsp; He must meet

<P>that truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn

<P>strength.&nbsp; Principles?&nbsp; Principles won't do.&nbsp; Acquisi-

<P>tions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at

<P>the first good shake.&nbsp; No; you want a deliberate belief.

<P>An appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there?&nbsp; Very

<P>well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice too, and for

<P>good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced.

<P>Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine senti-

<P>ments, is always safe.&nbsp; Who's that grunting?&nbsp; You

<P>wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance?&nbsp; Well,

<P>no--I didn't.&nbsp; Fine sentiments, you say?&nbsp; Fine senti-

<P>ments, be hanged!&nbsp; I had no time.&nbsp; I had to mess about

<P>with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping

<P>to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you.

<P>I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags,

<P>and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.&nbsp; There

<P>was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser

<P>man.&nbsp; And between whiles I had to look after the savage

<P>who was fireman.&nbsp; He was an improved specimen; he

<P>could fire up a vertical boiler.&nbsp; He was there below me,

<P>and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as

<P>seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat,

<P>walking on his hind-legs.&nbsp; A few months of training had

<P>done for that really fine chap.&nbsp; He squinted at the

<P>steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident

<P>effort of intrepidity--and he had filed teeth too, the

<P>poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer

<P>patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his

<P>cheeks.&nbsp; He ought to have been clapping his hands and

<P>stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was

<P>hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of

<P>improving knowledge.&nbsp; He was useful because he had

<P>been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should

<P>the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil

<P>spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the

<P>greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance.

<P>So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fear-

<P>fully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to

<P>his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch,

<P>stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded

<P>banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left

<P>behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept

<P>on, towards Kurtz.&nbsp; But the snags were thick, the water

<P>was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed

<P>to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fire-

<P>man nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came

<P>upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole,

<P>with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag

<P>of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-

<P>pile.&nbsp; This was unexpected.&nbsp; We came to the bank, and

<P>on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with

<P>some faded pencil-writing on it.&nbsp; When deciphered it

<P>said: 'Wood for you.&nbsp; Hurry up.&nbsp; Approach cautiously.'

<P>There was a signature, but it was illegible--not Kurtz

<P>--a much longer word.&nbsp; Hurry up.&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; Up the

<P>river?&nbsp; 'Approach cautiously.'&nbsp; We had not done so.

<P>But the warning could not have been meant for the place

<P>where it could be only found after approach.&nbsp; Some-

<P>thing was wrong above.&nbsp; But what--and how much?

<P>That was the question.&nbsp; We commented adversely upon

<P>the imbecility of that telegraphic style.&nbsp; The bush around

<P>said nothing, and would not let us look very far, either.

<P>A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the

<P>hut, and flapped sadly in our faces.&nbsp; The dwelling was

<P>dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived

<P>there not very long ago.&nbsp; There remained a rude table

<P>--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a

<P>dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book.&nbsp; It

<P>had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into

<P>a state of extremely dirty softness; but the back had been

<P>lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which

<P>looked clean yet.&nbsp; It was an extraordinary find.&nbsp; Its title

<P>was, 'An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship,' by a

<P>man Tower, Towson--some such name--Master in his

<P>Majesty's Navy.&nbsp; The matter looked dreary reading

<P>enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of

<P>figures, and the copy was sixty years old.&nbsp; I handled this

<P>amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness,

<P>lest it should dissolve in my hands.&nbsp; Within, Towson or

<P>Towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain

<P>of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters.&nbsp; Not

<P>a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you

<P>could see there a singleness of intention, an honest con-

<P>cern for the right way of going to work, which made

<P>these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,

<P>luminous with another than a professional light.&nbsp; The

<P>simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases,

<P>made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious

<P>sensation of having come upon something unmistakably

<P>real.&nbsp; Such a book being there was wonderful enough;

<P>but still more astounding were the notes penciled in the

<P>margin, and plainly referring to the text.&nbsp; I couldn't

<P>believe my eyes!&nbsp; They were in cipher!&nbsp; Yes, it looked

<P>like cipher.&nbsp; Fancy a man lugging with him a book of

<P>that description into this nowhere and studying it--

<P>and making notes--in cipher at that!&nbsp; It was an ex-

<P>travagant mystery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying

<P>noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile

<P>was gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims,

<P>was shouting at me from the river-side.&nbsp; I slipped the

<P>book into my pocket.&nbsp; I assure you to leave off reading

<P>was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old

<P>and solid friendship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I started the lame engine ahead.&nbsp; 'It must be this

<P>miserable trader--this intruder,' exclaimed the manager,

<P>looking back malevolently at the place we had left.&nbsp; 'He

<P>must be English,' I said.&nbsp; 'It will not save him from

<P>getting into trouble if he is not careful,' muttered the

<P>manager darkly.&nbsp; I observed with assumed innocence that

<P>no man was safe from trouble in this world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed

<P>at her last gasp, the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and

<P>I caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of

<P>the float, for in sober truth I expected the wretched thing

<P>to give up every moment.&nbsp; It was like watching the last

<P>flickers of a life.&nbsp; But still we crawled.&nbsp; Sometimes I

<P>would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our

<P>progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably be-

<P>fore we got abreast.&nbsp; To keep the eyes so long on one

<P>thing was too much for human patience.&nbsp; The manager

<P>displayed a beautiful resignation.&nbsp; I fretted and fumed

<P>and took to arguing with myself whether or no I would

<P>talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could come to any

<P>conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,

<P>indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility.

<P>What did it matter what anyone knew or ignored?&nbsp; What

<P>did it matter who was manager?&nbsp; One gets sometimes

<P>such a flash of insight.&nbsp; The essentials of this affair lay

<P>deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond

<P>my power of meddling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Towards the evening of the second day we judged

<P>ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz's station.&nbsp; I

<P>wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and

<P>told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it

<P>would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to

<P>wait where we were till next morning.&nbsp; Moreover, he

<P>pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously

<P>were to be followed, we must approach in daylight--

<P>not at dusk, or in the dark.&nbsp; This was sensible enough.

<P>Eight miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us,

<P>and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end

<P>of the reach.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond ex-

<P>pression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since

<P>one night more could not matter much after so many

<P>months.&nbsp; As we had plenty of wood, and caution was

<P>the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream.

<P>The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a

<P>railway cutting.&nbsp; The dusk came gliding into it long

<P>before the sun had set.&nbsp; The current ran smooth and

<P>swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks.&nbsp; The

<P>living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every

<P>living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed

<P>into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest

<P>leaf.&nbsp; It was not sleep--it seemed unnatural, like a

<P>state of trance.&nbsp; Not the faintest sound of any kind

<P>could be heard.&nbsp; You looked on amazed, and began to

<P>suspect yourself of being deaf--then the night came

<P>suddenly, and struck you blind as well.&nbsp; About three

<P>in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud

<P>splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired.

<P>When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm

<P>and clammy, and more blinding than the night.&nbsp; It did

<P>not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round

<P>you like something solid.&nbsp; At eight or nine, perhaps, it

<P>lifted as a shutter lifts.&nbsp; We had a glimpse of the tower-

<P>ing multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle,

<P>with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it--

<P>all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came down

<P>again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves.&nbsp; I

<P>ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to

<P>be paid out again.&nbsp; Before it stopped running with a

<P>muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite

<P>desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air.&nbsp; It ceased.

<P>A complaining clamor, modulated in savage discords,

<P>filled our ears.&nbsp; The sheer unexpectedness of it made

<P>my hair stir under my cap.&nbsp; I don't know how it struck

<P>the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself

<P>had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all

<P>sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar

<P>arise.&nbsp; It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost

<P>intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leav-

<P>ing us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and ob-

<P>stinately listening to the nearly as appalling and ex-

<P>cessive silence.&nbsp; 'Good God!&nbsp; What is the meaning--?'

<P>stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims,--a little

<P>fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore

<P>side-spring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his

<P>socks.&nbsp; Two others remained open-mouthed a whole min-

<P>ute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out in-

<P>continently and stand darting scared glances, with Win-

<P>chesters at 'ready' in their hands.&nbsp; What we could see

<P>was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as

<P>though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a

<P>misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around

<P>her--and that was all.&nbsp; The rest of the world was no-

<P>where, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned.&nbsp; Just

<P>nowhere.&nbsp; Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving

<P>a whisper or a shadow behind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled

<P>in short, so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move

<P>the steamboat at once if necessary.&nbsp; 'Will they attack?'

<P>whispered an awed voice.&nbsp; 'We will all be butchered in

<P>this fog,' murmured another.&nbsp; The faces twitched with

<P>the strain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot

<P>to wink.&nbsp; It was very curious to see the contrast of ex-

<P>pressions of the white men and of the black fellows of

<P>our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the

<P>river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred

<P>miles away.&nbsp; The whites, of course greatly discomposed,

<P>had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked

<P>by such an outrageous row.&nbsp; The others had an alert,

<P>naturally interested expression; but their faces were es-

<P>sentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned

<P>as they hauled at the chain.&nbsp; Several exchanged short,

<P>grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to

<P>their satisfaction.&nbsp; Their headman, a young, broad-

<P>chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed

<P>cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up art-

<P>fully in oily ringlets, stood near me.&nbsp; 'Aha!' I said, just

<P>for good fellowship's sake.&nbsp; 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,

<P>with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of

<P>sharp teeth--'catch 'im.&nbsp; Give 'im to us.'&nbsp; 'To you,

<P>eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with them?'&nbsp; 'Eat

<P>'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail,

<P>looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly

<P>pensive attitude.&nbsp; I would no doubt have been properly

<P>horrified, had it not occurred to me that he and his

<P>chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been

<P>growing increasingly hungry for at least this month

<P>past.&nbsp; They had been engaged for six months (I don't

<P>think a single one of them had any clear idea of time,

<P>as we at the end of countless ages have.&nbsp; They still be-

<P>longed to the beginnings of time--had no inherited ex-

<P>perience to teach them as it were), and of course, as

<P>long as there was a piece of paper written over in ac-

<P>cordance with some farcical law or other made down the

<P>river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how

<P>they would live.&nbsp; Certainly they had brought with them

<P>some rotten hippo-meat, which couldn't have lasted very

<P>long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in the midst

<P>of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity

<P>of it overboard.&nbsp; It looked like a high-handed proceed-

<P>ing; but it was really a case of legitimate self-defense.

<P>You can't breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and

<P>eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip

<P>on existence.&nbsp; Besides that, they had given them every

<P>week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine inches

<P>long; and the theory was they were to buy their pro-

<P>visions with that currency in river-side villages.&nbsp; You

<P>can see how THAT worked.&nbsp; There were either no villages,

<P>or the people were hostile, or the director, who like the

<P>rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old he-goat

<P>thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for some more

<P>or less recondite reason.&nbsp; So, unless they swallowed the

<P>wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with,

<P>I don't see what good their extravagant salary could be

<P>to them.&nbsp; I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy

<P>of a large and honorable trading company.&nbsp; For the

<P>rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn't look eat-

<P>able in the least--I saw in their possession was a few

<P>lumps of some stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty

<P>lavender color, they kept wrapped in leaves, and now and

<P>then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed

<P>done more for the looks of the thing than for any seri-

<P>ous purpose of sustenance.&nbsp; Why in the name of all the

<P>gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for us--they

<P>were thirty to five--and have a good tuck in for once,

<P>amazes me now when I think of it.&nbsp; They were big

<P>powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the con-

<P>sequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though

<P>their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no

<P>longer hard.&nbsp; And I saw that something restraining, one

<P>of those human secrets that baffle probability, had come

<P>into play there.&nbsp; I looked at them with a swift quicken-

<P>ing of interest--not because it occurred to me I might

<P>be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you

<P>that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--

<P>how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes,

<P>I positively hoped, that my aspect was not so--what shall

<P>I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity

<P>which fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded

<P>all my days at that time.&nbsp; Perhaps I had a little fever

<P>too.&nbsp; One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on

<P>one's pulse.&nbsp; I had often 'a little fever,' or a little touch

<P>of other things--the playful paw-strokes of the wilder-

<P>ness, the preliminary trifling before the more serious

<P>onslaught which came in due course.&nbsp; Yes; I looked at

<P>them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity

<P>of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when

<P>brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity.

<P>Restraint!&nbsp; What possible restraint?&nbsp; Was it supersti-

<P>tion, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive

<P>honor?&nbsp; No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience

<P>can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where

<P>hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you

<P>may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.

<P>Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its

<P>exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its somber and

<P>brooding ferocity?&nbsp; Well, I do.&nbsp; It takes a man all his

<P>inborn strength to fight hunger properly.&nbsp; It's really

<P>easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition

<P>of one's soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger.&nbsp; Sad,

<P>but true.&nbsp; And these chaps too had no earthly reason

<P>for any kind of scruple.&nbsp; Restraint!&nbsp; I would just as

<P>soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling

<P>amongst the corpses of a battlefield.&nbsp; But there was the

<P>fact facing me--the fact dazzling, to be seen, like the

<P>foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an un-

<P>fathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought

<P>of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate

<P>grief in this savage clamor that had swept by us on the

<P>river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of the fog.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers

<P>as to which bank.&nbsp; 'Left.'&nbsp; 'No, no; how can you?

<P>Right, right, of course.'&nbsp; 'It is very serious,' said the

<P>manager's voice behind me; 'I would be desolated if

<P>anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came

<P>up.'&nbsp; I looked at him, and had not the slightest doubt

<P>he was sincere.&nbsp; He was just the kind of man who would

<P>wish to preserve appearances.&nbsp; That was his restraint.

<P>But when he muttered something about going on at once,

<P>I did not even take the trouble to answer him.&nbsp; I knew,

<P>and he knew, that it was impossible.&nbsp; Were we to let go

<P>our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in the

<P>air--in space.&nbsp; We wouldn't be able to tell where we

<P>were going to--whether up or down stream, or across

<P>--till we fetched against one bank or the other,--and

<P>then we wouldn't know at first which it was.&nbsp; Of course

<P>I made no move.&nbsp; I had no mind for a smash-up.&nbsp; You

<P>couldn't imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck.

<P>Whether drowned at once or not, we were sure to perish

<P>speedily in one way or another.&nbsp; 'I authorize you to

<P>take all the risks,' he said, after a short silence.&nbsp; 'I refuse

<P>to take any,' I said shortly; which was just the answer

<P>he expected, though its tone might have surprised him.

<P>'Well, I must defer to your judgment.&nbsp; You are cap-

<P>tain,' he said, with marked civility.&nbsp; I turned my shoul-

<P>der to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into

<P>the fog.&nbsp; How long would it last?&nbsp; It was the most hope-

<P>less look-out.&nbsp; The approach to this Kurtz grubbing

<P>for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many

<P>dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess

<P>sleeping in a fabulous castle.&nbsp; 'Will they attack, do you

<P>think?' asked the manager, in a confidential tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did not think they would attack, for several obvious

<P>reasons.&nbsp; The thick fog was one.&nbsp; If they left the bank

<P>in their canoes they would get lost in it, as we would

<P>be if we attempted to move.&nbsp; Still, I had also judged the

<P>jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet eyes

<P>were in it, eyes that had seen us.&nbsp; The river-side bushes

<P>were certainly very thick; but the undergrowth behind

<P>was evidently penetrable.&nbsp; However, during the short

<P>lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach--cer-

<P>tainly not abreast of the steamer.&nbsp; But what made the

<P>idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the

<P>noise--of the cries we had heard.&nbsp; They had not the

<P>fierce character boding of immediate hostile intention.

<P>Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had

<P>given me an irresistible impression of sorrow.&nbsp; The

<P>glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those

<P>savages with unrestrained grief.&nbsp; The danger, if any,

<P>I expounded, was from our proximity to a great hu-

<P>man passion let loose.&nbsp; Even extreme grief may ulti-

<P>mately vent itself in violence--but more generally takes

<P>the form of apathy. . . .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You should have seen the pilgrims stare!&nbsp; They had

<P>no heart to grin, or even to revile me; but I believe they

<P>thought me gone mad--with fright, maybe.&nbsp; I delivered

<P>a regular lecture.&nbsp; My dear boys, it was no good bother-

<P>ing.&nbsp; Keep a look-out?&nbsp; Well, you may guess I watched

<P>the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse;

<P>but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to

<P>us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of

<P>cotton-wool.&nbsp; It felt like it too--choking, warm, stifling.

<P>Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was

<P>absolutely true to fact.&nbsp; What we afterwards alluded to

<P>as an attack was really an attempt at repulse.&nbsp; The

<P>action was very far from being aggressive--it was not

<P>even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken

<P>under the stress of desperation, and in its essence was

<P>purely protective.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the

<P>fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly

<P>speaking, about a mile and a half below Kurtz's station.

<P>We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when

<P>I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green,

<P>in the middle of the stream.&nbsp; It was the only thing of

<P>the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived

<P>it was the head of a long sandbank, or rather of a chain

<P>of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the

<P>river.&nbsp; They were discolored, just awash, and the whole

<P>lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man's

<P>backbone is seen running down the middle of his back

<P>under the skin.&nbsp; Now, as far as I did see, I could go

<P>to the right or to the left of this.&nbsp; I didn't know either

<P>channel, of course.&nbsp; The banks looked pretty well alike,

<P>the depth appeared the same; but as I had been informed

<P>the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for

<P>the western passage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became

<P>aware it was much narrower than I had supposed.&nbsp; To

<P>the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal,

<P>and to the right a high, steep bank heavily overgrown

<P>with bushes.&nbsp; Above the bush the trees stood in serried

<P>ranks.&nbsp; The twigs overhung the current thickly, and

<P>from distance to distance a large limb of some tree pro-

<P>jected rigidly over the stream.&nbsp; It was then well on in

<P>the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and

<P>a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water.

<P>In this shadow we steamed up--very slowly, as you may

<P>imagine.&nbsp; I sheered her well inshore--the water being

<P>deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sound-

<P>ing in the bows just below me.&nbsp; This steamboat was

<P>exactly like a decked scow.&nbsp; On the deck there were two

<P>little teak-wood houses, with doors and windows.&nbsp; The

<P>boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right

<P>astern.&nbsp; Over the whole there was a light roof, supported

<P>on stanchions.&nbsp; The funnel projected through that roof,

<P>and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light

<P>planks served for a pilot-house.&nbsp; It contained a couch,

<P>two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one

<P>corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel.&nbsp; It had a

<P>wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side.&nbsp; All

<P>these were always thrown open, of course.&nbsp; I spent my

<P>days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that

<P>roof, before the door.&nbsp; At night I slept, or tried to, on

<P>the couch.&nbsp; An athletic black belonging to some coast

<P>tribe, and educated by my poor predecessor, was the

<P>helmsman.&nbsp; He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a

<P>blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and

<P>thought all the world of himself.&nbsp; He was the most

<P>unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.&nbsp; He steered with

<P>no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost

<P>sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject

<P>funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the

<P>upper hand of him in a minute.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feel-

<P>ing much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it

<P>stick out of that river, when I saw my poleman give up

<P>the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on

<P>the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his

<P>pole in.&nbsp; He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in

<P>the water.&nbsp; At the same time the fireman, whom I could

<P>also see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace

<P>and ducked his head.&nbsp; I was amazed.&nbsp; Then I had to look

<P>at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in

<P>the fairway.&nbsp; Sticks, little sticks, were flying about--

<P>thick: they were whizzing before my nose, dropping be-

<P>low me, striking behind me against my pilot-house.&nbsp; All

<P>this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--

<P>perfectly quiet.&nbsp; I could only hear the heavy splashing

<P>thump of the stern-wheel and the patter of these things.

<P>We cleared the snag clumsily.&nbsp; Arrows, by Jove!&nbsp; We

<P>were being shot at!&nbsp; I stepped in quickly to close the

<P>shutter on the land side.&nbsp; That fool-helmsman, his hands

<P>on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his

<P>feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse.&nbsp; Con-

<P>found him!&nbsp; And we were staggering within ten feet of

<P>the bank.&nbsp; I had to lean right out to swing the heavy

<P>shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the

<P>level with my own, looking at me very fierce and steady;

<P>and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed

<P>from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom,

<P>naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes,--the bush was

<P>swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening, of

<P>bronze color.&nbsp; The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the

<P>arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.

<P>'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman.&nbsp; He held

<P>his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he

<P>kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his

<P>mouth foamed a little.&nbsp; 'Keep quiet!' I said in a fury.

<P>I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway

<P>in the wind.&nbsp; I darted out.&nbsp; Below me there was a great

<P>scuffle of feet on the iron deck; confused exclamations;

<P>a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?'&nbsp; I caught shape

<P>of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; An-

<P>other snag!&nbsp; A fusillade burst out under my feet.&nbsp; The

<P>pilgrims had opened with their Winchesters, and were

<P>simply squirting lead into that bush.&nbsp; A deuce of a

<P>lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward.&nbsp; I

<P>swore at it.&nbsp; Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag

<P>either.&nbsp; I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows

<P>came in swarms.&nbsp; They might have been poisoned, but

<P>they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat.&nbsp; The

<P>bush began to howl.&nbsp; Our wood-cutters raised a warlike

<P>whoop; the report of a rifle just at my back deafened

<P>me.&nbsp; I glanced over my shoulder, and the pilot-house

<P>was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash

<P>at the wheel.&nbsp; The fool-nigger had dropped everything,

<P>to throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry.

<P>He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled

<P>at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden

<P>twist out of that steamboat.&nbsp; There was no room to

<P>turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere

<P>very near ahead in that confounded smoke, there

<P>was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the

<P>bank--right into the bank, where I knew the water

<P>was deep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a

<P>whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves.&nbsp; The fusillade

<P>below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would when

<P>the squirts got empty.&nbsp; I threw my head back to a glint-

<P>ing whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-

<P>hole and out at the other.&nbsp; Looking past that mad helms-

<P>man, who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at

<P>the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double,

<P>leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent.&nbsp; Some-

<P>thing big appeared in the air before the shutter, the

<P>rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly,

<P>looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, pro-

<P>found, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet.&nbsp; The

<P>side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what

<P>appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over

<P>a little camp-stool.&nbsp; It looked as though after wrench-

<P>ing that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his

<P>balance in the effort.&nbsp; The thin smoke had blown away,

<P>we were clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see

<P>that in another hundred yards or so I would be free to

<P>sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very

<P>warm and wet that I had to look down.&nbsp; The man had

<P>rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both

<P>his hands clutched that cane.&nbsp; It was the shaft of a

<P>spear that, either thrown or lunged through the open-

<P>ing, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the

<P>blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful

<P>gash; my shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still,

<P>gleaming dark-red under the wheel; his eyes shone with

<P>an amazing luster.&nbsp; The fusillade burst out again.&nbsp; He

<P>looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like some-

<P>thing precious, with an air of being afraid I would try

<P>to take it away from him.&nbsp; I had to make an effort to

<P>free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering.

<P>With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the

<P>steam-whistled, and jerked out screech after screech hur-

<P>riedly.&nbsp; The tumult of angry and warlike yells was

<P>checked instantly, and then from the depths of the woods

<P>went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mourn-

<P>ful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow

<P>the flight of the last hope from the earth.&nbsp; There was

<P>a great commotion in the bush; the shower of arrows

<P>stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply--then

<P>silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel

<P>came plainly to my ears.&nbsp; I put the helm hard a-star-

<P>board at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas,

<P>very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway.&nbsp; 'The

<P>manager sends me--' he began in an official tone, and

<P>stopped short.&nbsp; 'Good God!' he said, glaring at the

<P>wounded man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and

<P>inquiring glance enveloped us both.&nbsp; I declare it looked

<P>as though he would presently put to us some question in

<P>an understandable language; but he died without utter-

<P>ing a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching

<P>a muscle.&nbsp; Only in the very last moment, as though in

<P>response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper

<P>we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown

<P>gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably somber,

<P>brooding, and menacing expression.&nbsp; The luster of in-

<P>quiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness.&nbsp; 'Can

<P>you steer?' I asked the agent eagerly.&nbsp; He looked very

<P>dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he under-

<P>stood at once I meant him to steer whether or no.&nbsp; To

<P>tell you the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change

<P>my shoes and socks.&nbsp; 'He is dead,' murmured the fel-

<P>low, immensely impressed.&nbsp; 'No doubt about it,' said I,

<P>tugging like mad at the shoe-laces.&nbsp; 'And, by the way,

<P>I suppose Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For the moment that was the dominant thought.

<P>There was a sense of extreme disappointment, as though

<P>I had found out I had been striving after something al-

<P>together without a substance.&nbsp; I couldn't have been more

<P>disgusted if I had traveled all this way for the sole

<P>purpose of talking with Mr. Kurtz.&nbsp; Talking with.

<P>. . .&nbsp; I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware

<P>that that was exactly what I had been looking forward

<P>to--a talk with Kurtz.&nbsp; I made the strange discovery

<P>that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but

<P>as discoursing.&nbsp; I didn't say to myself, 'Now I will

<P>never see him,' or 'Now I will never shake him by the

<P>hand,' but, 'Now I will never hear him.'&nbsp; The man pre-

<P>sented himself as a voice.&nbsp; Not of course that I did not

<P>connect him with some sort of action.&nbsp; Hadn't I been

<P>told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he

<P>had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory

<P>than all the other agents together.&nbsp; That was not the

<P>point.&nbsp; The point was in his being a gifted creature, and

<P>that of all his gifts the one that stood out pre-

<P>eminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence,

<P>was his ability to talk, his words--the gift of expression,

<P>the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and

<P>the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or

<P>the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable

<P>darkness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that

<P>river.&nbsp; I thought, By Jove! it's all over.&nbsp; We are too

<P>late; he has vanished--the gift has vanished, by means

<P>of some spear, arrow, or club.&nbsp; I will never hear that

<P>chap speak after all,--and my sorrow had a startling

<P>extravagance of emotion, even such as I had noticed in

<P>the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush.&nbsp; I

<P>couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation somehow,

<P>had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny

<P>in life. . . .&nbsp; Why do you sigh in this beastly way,

<P>somebody?&nbsp; Absurd?&nbsp; Well, absurd.&nbsp; Good Lord!

<P>mustn't a man ever--&nbsp; Here, give me some to-

<P>bacco." . . .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match

<P>flared, and Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow,

<P>with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect

<P>of concentrated attention; and as he took vigorous draws

<P>at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of the

<P>night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame.&nbsp; The match

<P>went out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Absurd!" he cried.&nbsp; "This is the worst of trying

<P>to tell. . . .&nbsp; Here you all are, each moored with two

<P>good addresses, like a hulk with two anchors, a butcher

<P>round one corner, a policeman round another, excellent

<P>appetites, and temperature normal--you hear--normal

<P>from year's end to year's end.&nbsp; And you say, Absurd!

<P>Absurd be--exploded!&nbsp; Absurd!&nbsp; My dear boys, what

<P>can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervous-

<P>ness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes.

<P>Now I think of it, it is amazing I did not shed tears.

<P>I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude.&nbsp; I was

<P>cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable

<P>privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz.&nbsp; Of course

<P>I was wrong.&nbsp; The privilege was waiting for me.&nbsp; Oh

<P>yes, I heard more than enough.&nbsp; And I was right, too.

<P>A voice.&nbsp; He was very little more than a voice.&nbsp; And

<P>I heard--him--it--this voice--other voices--all of them

<P>were so little more than voices--and the memory of that

<P>time itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying

<P>vibration of one immense jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid,

<P>savage, or simply mean, without any kind of sense.

<P>Voices, voices--even the girl herself--now--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was silent for a long time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie," he

<P>began suddenly.&nbsp; "Girl!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Did I mention a

<P>girl?&nbsp; Oh, she is out of it--completely.&nbsp; They--the

<P>women I mean--are out of it--should be out of it.&nbsp; We

<P>must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their

<P>own, lest ours gets worse.&nbsp; Oh, she had to be out of it.

<P>You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr.

<P>Kurtz saying, 'My Intended.'&nbsp; You would have per-

<P>ceived directly then how completely she was out of it.

<P>And the lofty frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz!&nbsp; They say

<P>the hair goes on growing sometimes, but this--ah--

<P>specimen, was impressively bald.&nbsp; The wilderness had

<P>patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball

<P>--an ivory ball; it had caressed him, and--lo!--he had

<P>withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him,

<P>got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his

<P>soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some

<P>devilish initiation.&nbsp; He was its spoiled and pampered

<P>favorite.&nbsp; Ivory?&nbsp; I should think so.&nbsp; Heaps of it,

<P>stacks of it.&nbsp; The old mud shanty was bursting with it.

<P>You would think there was not a single tusk left either

<P>above or below the ground in the whole country.&nbsp; 'Mostly

<P>fossil,' the manager had remarked disparagingly.&nbsp; It

<P>was no more fossil than I am; but they call it fossil

<P>when it is dug up.&nbsp; It appears these niggers do bury

<P>the tusks sometimes--but evidently they couldn't bury

<P>this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz

<P>from his fate.&nbsp; We filled the steamboat with it, and had

<P>to pile a lot on the deck.&nbsp; Thus he could see and enjoy

<P>as long as he could see, because the appreciation of

<P>this favor had remained with him to the last.&nbsp; You should

<P>have heard him say, 'My ivory.'&nbsp; Oh yes, I heard him.

<P>'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my--'

<P>everything belonged to him.&nbsp; It made me hold my breath

<P>in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a

<P>prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed

<P>stars in their places.&nbsp; Everything belonged to him--but

<P>that was a trifle.&nbsp; The thing was to know what he be-

<P>longed to, how many powers of darkness claimed him

<P>for their own.&nbsp; That was the reflection that made you

<P>creepy all over.&nbsp; It was impossible--it was not good for

<P>one either--trying to imagine.&nbsp; He had taken a high

<P>seat amongst the devils of the land--I mean literally.

<P>You can't understand.&nbsp; How could you?--with solid

<P>pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind neigh-

<P>bors ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping

<P>delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the

<P>holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums

<P>--how can you imagine what particular region of the

<P>first ages a man's untrammeled feet may take him into

<P>by the way of solitude--utter solitude without a police-

<P>man--by the way of silence, utter silence, where no

<P>warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard whisper-

<P>ing of public opinion?&nbsp; These little things make all the

<P>great difference.&nbsp; When they are gone you must fall

<P>back upon your own innate strength, upon your own

<P>capacity for faithfulness.&nbsp; Of course you may be too

<P>much of a fool to go wrong--too dull even to know you

<P>are being assaulted by the powers of darkness.&nbsp; I take

<P>it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the

<P>devil: the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too

<P>much of a devil--I don't know which.&nbsp; Or you may be

<P>such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether

<P>deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and

<P>sounds.&nbsp; Then the earth for you is only a standing place

<P>--and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I

<P>won't pretend to say.&nbsp; But most of us are neither one

<P>nor the other.&nbsp; The earth for us is a place to live in,

<P>where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with

<P>smells too, by Jove!--breathe dead hippo, so to speak,

<P>and not be contaminated.&nbsp; And there, don't you see?

<P>your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the

<P>digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in--

<P>your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an

<P>obscure, back-breaking business.&nbsp; And that's difficult

<P>enough.&nbsp; Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even ex-

<P>plain--I am trying to account to myself for--for--Mr.

<P>Kurtz--for the shade of Mr. Kurtz.&nbsp; This initiated

<P>wraith from the back of Nowhere honored me with its

<P>amazing confidence before it vanished altogether.&nbsp; This

<P>was because it could speak English to me.&nbsp; The original

<P>Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and--as

<P>he was good enough to say himself--his sympathies were

<P>in the right place.&nbsp; His mother was half-English, his

<P>father was half-French.&nbsp; All Europe contributed to the

<P>making of Kurtz; and by-and-by I learned that, most

<P>appropriately, the International Society for the Sup-

<P>pression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the

<P>making of a report, for its future guidance.&nbsp; And he

<P>had written it too.&nbsp; I've seen it.&nbsp; I've read it.&nbsp; It
was

<P>eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung,

<P>I think.&nbsp; Seventeen pages of close writing he had found

<P>time for!&nbsp; But this must have been before his--let us

<P>say--nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at

<P>certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites,

<P>which--as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I

<P>heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you

<P>understand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself.&nbsp; But it was a beau-

<P>tiful piece of writing.&nbsp; The opening paragraph, how-

<P>ever, in the light of later information, strikes me now

<P>as ominous.&nbsp; He began with the argument that we whites,

<P>from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must

<P>necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of

<P>supernatural beings--we approach them with the might

<P>as of a deity,' and so on, and so on.&nbsp; 'By the simple

<P>exercise of our will we can exert a power for good

<P>practically unbounded,' &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; From that point he

<P>soared and took me with him.&nbsp; The peroration was mag-

<P>nificent, though difficult to remember, you know.&nbsp; It

<P>gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by

<P>an august Benevolence.&nbsp; It made me tingle with en-

<P>thusiasm.&nbsp; This was the unbounded power of eloquence

<P>--of words--of burning noble words.&nbsp; There were no

<P>practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases,

<P>unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page,

<P>scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand,

<P>may be regarded as the exposition of a method.&nbsp; It

<P>was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal

<P>to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous

<P>and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky:

<P>'Exterminate all the brutes!'&nbsp; The curious part was

<P>that he had apparently forgotten all about that valu-

<P>able postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense

<P>came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take

<P>good care of 'my pamphlet' (he called it), as it was

<P>sure to have in the future a good influence upon his

<P>career.&nbsp; I had full information about all these things,

<P>and, besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of

<P>his memory.&nbsp; I've done enough for it to give me the

<P>indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlast-

<P>ing rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the

<P>sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats

<P>of civilization.&nbsp; But then, you see, I can't choose.&nbsp; He

<P>won't be forgotten.&nbsp; Whatever he was, he was not com-

<P>mon.&nbsp; He had the power to charm or frighten rudi-

<P>mentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his

<P>honor; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims

<P>with bitter misgivings: he had one devoted friend at

<P>least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that

<P>was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking.

<P>No; I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to

<P>affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in

<P>getting to him.&nbsp; I missed my late helmsman awfully,--

<P>I missed him even while his body was still lying in the

<P>pilot-house.&nbsp; Perhaps you will think it passing strange

<P>this regret for a savage who was no more account than

<P>a grain of sand in a black Sahara.&nbsp; Well, don't you see,

<P>he had done something, he had steered; for months I

<P>had him at my back--a help--an instrument.&nbsp; It was

<P>a kind of partnership.&nbsp; He steered for me--I had to

<P>look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus

<P>a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became

<P>aware when it was suddenly broken.&nbsp; And the intimate

<P>profundity of that look he gave me when he received

<P>his hurt remains to this day in my memory--like a claim

<P>of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Poor fool!&nbsp; If he had only left that shutter alone.

<P>He had no restraint, no restraint--just like Kurtz--a

<P>tree swayed by the wind.&nbsp; As soon as I had put on a dry

<P>pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first jerking

<P>the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I

<P>performed with my eyes shut tight.&nbsp; His heels leaped

<P>together over the little door-step; his shoulders were

<P>pressed to my breast; I hugged him from behind des-

<P>perately.&nbsp; Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any

<P>man on earth, I should imagine.&nbsp; Then without more

<P>ado I tipped him overboard.&nbsp; The current snatched him

<P>as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I saw the

<P>body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever.

<P>All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated

<P>on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at

<P>each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there was

<P>a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.

<P>What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for

<P>I can't guess.&nbsp; Embalm it, maybe.&nbsp; But I had also heard

<P>another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below.

<P>My friends the wood-cutters were likewise scandalized,

<P>and with a better show of reason--though I admit that

<P>the reason itself was quite inadmissible.&nbsp; Oh, quite!&nbsp; I

<P>had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to

<P>be eaten, the fishes alone should have him.&nbsp; He had

<P>been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now

<P>he was dead he might have become a first-class tempta-

<P>tion, and possibly cause some startling trouble.&nbsp; Besides,

<P>I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas

<P>showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This I did directly the simple funeral was over.&nbsp; We

<P>were going half-speed, keeping right in the middle of

<P>the stream, and I listened to the talk about me.&nbsp; They

<P>had given up Kurtz, they had given up the station;

<P>Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and

<P>so on--and so on.&nbsp; The red-haired pilgrim was beside

<P>himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz

<P>had been properly revenged.&nbsp; 'Say!&nbsp; We must have

<P>made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush.&nbsp; Eh?

<P>What do you think?&nbsp; Say?'&nbsp; He positively danced, the

<P>bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.&nbsp; And he had nearly

<P>fainted when he saw the wounded man!&nbsp; I could not

<P>help saying, 'You made a glorious lot of smoke, any-

<P>how.'&nbsp; I had seen, from the way the tops of the bushes

<P>rustled and flew, that almost all the shots had gone too

<P>high.&nbsp; You can't hit anything unless you take aim and

<P>fire from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the

<P>hip with their eyes shut.&nbsp; The retreat, I maintained--

<P>and I was right--was caused by the screeching of the

<P>steam-whistle.&nbsp; Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began

<P>to howl at me with indignant protests.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confi-

<P>dentially about the necessity of getting well away down

<P>the river before dark at all events, when I saw in the

<P>distance a clearing on the river-side and the outlines of

<P>some sort of building.&nbsp; 'What's this?' I asked.&nbsp; He

<P>clapped his hands in wonder.&nbsp; 'The station!' he cried.

<P>I edged in at once, still going half-speed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill inter-

<P>spersed with rare trees and perfectly free from under-

<P>growth.&nbsp; A long decaying building on the summit was

<P>half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the

<P>peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and

<P>the woods made a background.&nbsp; There was no inclosure

<P>or fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently,

<P>for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in

<P>a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends orna-

<P>mented with round carved balls.&nbsp; The rails, or what-

<P>ever there had been between, had disappeared.&nbsp; Of

<P>course the forest surrounded all that.&nbsp; The river-bank

<P>was clear, and on the water-side I saw a white man under

<P>a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his

<P>whole arm.&nbsp; Examining the edge of the forest above and

<P>below, I was almost certain I could see movements--

<P>human forms gliding here and there.&nbsp; I steamed past

<P>prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift

<P>down.&nbsp; The man on the shore began to shout, urging us

<P>to land.&nbsp; 'We have been attacked,' screamed the man-

<P>ager.&nbsp; 'I know--I know.&nbsp; It's all right,' yelled back the

<P>other, as cheerful as you please.&nbsp; 'Come along.&nbsp; It's all

<P>right.&nbsp; I am glad.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"His aspect reminded me of something I had seen--

<P>something funny I had seen somewhere.&nbsp; As I maneuvered

<P>to get alongside, I was asking myself, 'What does this

<P>fellow look like?'&nbsp; Suddenly I got it.&nbsp; He looked like a

<P>harlequin.&nbsp; His clothes had been made of some stuff

<P>that was brown holland probably, but it was covered with

<P>patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and yel-

<P>low,--patches on the back, patches on front, patches on

<P>elbows, on knees; colored binding round his jacket, scar-

<P>let edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sun-

<P>shine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat

<P>withal, because you could see how beautifully all this

<P>patching had been done.&nbsp; A beardless, boyish face, very

<P>fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue

<P>eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that

<P>open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind-

<P>swept plain.&nbsp; 'Look out, captain!' he cried; 'there's a

<P>snag lodged in here last night.'&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Another

<P>snag?&nbsp; I confess I swore shamefully.&nbsp; I had nearly holed

<P>my cripple, to finish off that charming trip.&nbsp; The harle-

<P>quin on the bank turned his little pug nose up to me.

<P>'You English?' he asked, all smiles.&nbsp; 'Are you?' I

<P>shouted from the wheel.&nbsp; The smiles vanished, and he

<P>shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment.&nbsp; Then

<P>he brightened up.&nbsp; 'Never mind!' he cried encourag-

<P>ingly.&nbsp; 'Are we in time?' I asked.&nbsp; 'He is up there,'

<P>he replied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and

<P>becoming gloomy all of a sudden.&nbsp; His face was like

<P>the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright the

<P>next.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of

<P>them armed to the teeth, had gone to the house, this

<P>chap came on board.&nbsp; 'I say, I don't like this.&nbsp; These

<P>natives are in the bush,' I said.&nbsp; He assured me earnestly

<P>it was all right.&nbsp; 'They are simple people,' he added;

<P>'well, I am glad you came.&nbsp; It took me all my time to

<P>keep them off.'&nbsp; 'But you said it was all right,' I cried.

<P>'Oh, they meant no harm,' he said; and as I stared he

<P>corrected himself, 'Not exactly.'&nbsp; Then vivaciously,

<P>'My faith, your pilot-house wants a clean up!'&nbsp; In the

<P>next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the

<P>boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble.&nbsp; 'One

<P>good screech will do more for you than all your rifles.

<P>They are simple people,' he repeated.&nbsp; He rattled away

<P>at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me.&nbsp; He seemed to

<P>be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually

<P>hinted, laughing, that such was the case.&nbsp; 'Don't you

<P>talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said.&nbsp; 'You don't talk with

<P>that man--you listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe

<P>exaltation.&nbsp; 'But now--'&nbsp; He waved his arm, and in

<P>the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of

<P>despondency.&nbsp; In a moment he came up again with a

<P>jump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them

<P>continuously, while he gabbled: 'Brother sailor . . .

<P>honor . . . pleasure . . . delight . . . introduce

<P>myself . . . Russian . . . son of an arch-priest

<P>. . . Government of Tambov . . .&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Tobacco!

<P>English tobacco; the excellent English tobacco!&nbsp; Now,

<P>that's brotherly.&nbsp; Smoke?&nbsp; Where's a sailor that does

<P>not smoke?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he

<P>had run away from school, had gone to sea in a Russian

<P>ship; ran away again; served some time in English

<P>ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest.&nbsp; He made

<P>a point of that.&nbsp; 'But when one is young one must see

<P>things, gather experience, ideas; enlarge the mind.'

<P>'Here!' I interrupted.&nbsp; 'You can never tell!&nbsp; Here I

<P>have met Mr. Kurtz,' he said, youthfully solemn and

<P>reproachful.&nbsp; I held my tongue after that.&nbsp; It appears

<P>he had persuaded a Dutch trading-house on the coast

<P>to fit him out with stores and goods, and had started for

<P>the interior with a light heart, and no more idea of what

<P>would happen to him than a baby.&nbsp; He had been wan-

<P>dering about that river for nearly two years alone, cut

<P>off from everybody and everything.&nbsp; 'I am not so young

<P>as I look.&nbsp; I am twenty-five,' he said.&nbsp; 'At first old Van

<P>Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,' he narrated

<P>with keen enjoyment; 'but I stuck to him, and talked

<P>and talked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the

<P>hind-leg off his favorite dog, so he gave me some cheap

<P>things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would

<P>never see my face again.&nbsp; Good old Dutchman, Van

<P>Shuyten.&nbsp; I've sent him one small lot of ivory a year

<P>ago, so that he can't call me a little thief when I get

<P>back.&nbsp; I hope he got it.&nbsp; And for the rest I don't care.

<P>I had some wood stacked for you.&nbsp; That was my old

<P>house.&nbsp; Did you see?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I gave him Towson's book.&nbsp; He made as though he

<P>would kiss me, but restrained himself.&nbsp; 'The only book

<P>I had left, and I thought I had lost it,' he said, looking

<P>at it ecstatically.&nbsp; 'So many accidents happen to a man

<P>going about alone, you know.&nbsp; Canoes get upset some-

<P>times--and sometimes you've got to clear out so quick

<P>when the people get angry.'&nbsp; He thumbed the pages.

<P>'You made notes in Russian?' I asked.&nbsp; He nodded.

<P>'I thought they were written in cipher,' I said.&nbsp; He

<P>laughed, then became serious.&nbsp; 'I had lots of trouble

<P>to keep these people off,' he said.&nbsp; 'Did they want to

<P>kill you?' I asked.&nbsp; 'Oh no!' he cried, and checked him-

<P>self.&nbsp; 'Why did they attack us?' I pursued.&nbsp; He hesi-

<P>tated, then said shamefacedly, 'They don't want him to

<P>go.'&nbsp; 'Don't they?' I said, curiously.&nbsp; He nodded a

<P>nod full of mystery and wisdom.&nbsp; 'I tell you,' he cried,

<P>'this man has enlarged my mind.'&nbsp; He opened his arms

<P>wide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were

<P>perfectly round."
