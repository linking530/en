<P>The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor with-

<P>out a flutter of the sails, and was at rest.&nbsp; The flood

<P>had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound

<P>down the river, the only thing for it was to come to

<P>and wait for the turn of the tide.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like

<P>the beginning of an interminable waterway.&nbsp; In the

<P>offing the sea and the sky were welded together without

<P>a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of

<P>the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand

<P>still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with

<P>gleams of varnished sprits.&nbsp; A haze rested on the low

<P>shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.&nbsp; The

<P>air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still

<P>seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding mo-

<P>tionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Director of Companies was our captain and our

<P>host.&nbsp; We four affectionately watched his back as he

<P>stood in the bows looking to seaward.&nbsp; On the whole

<P>river there was nothing that looked half so nautical.&nbsp; He

<P>resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness

<P>personified.&nbsp; It was difficult to realize his work was not

<P>out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within

<P>the brooding gloom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Between us there was, as I have already said some-

<P>where, the bond of the sea.&nbsp; Besides holding our hearts

<P>together through long periods of separation, it had the

<P>effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and

<P>even convictions.&nbsp; The Lawyer--the best of old fellows

<P>--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the

<P>only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug.

<P>The Accountant had brought out already a box of

<P>dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones.

<P>Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the

<P>mizzen-mast.&nbsp; He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complex-

<P>ion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his

<P>arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled

<P>an idol.&nbsp; The Director, satisfied the anchor had good

<P>hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.&nbsp; We

<P>exchanged a few words lazily.&nbsp; Afterwards there was

<P>silence on board the yacht.&nbsp; For some reason or other

<P>we did not begin that game of dominoes.&nbsp; We felt medi-

<P>tative, and fit for nothing but placid staring.&nbsp; The day

<P>was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance.

<P>The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck,

<P>was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very

<P>mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant

<P>fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping

<P>the low shores in diaphanous folds.&nbsp; Only the gloom to

<P>the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more

<P>somber every minute, as if angered by the approach

<P>of the sun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the

<P>sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a

<P>dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to

<P>go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that

<P>gloom brooding over a crowd of men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the

<P>serenity became less brilliant but more profound.&nbsp; The

<P>old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline

<P>of day, after ages of good service done to the race that

<P>peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of

<P>a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth.

<P>We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush

<P>of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in

<P>the august light of abiding memories.&nbsp; And indeed

<P>nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,

<P>"followed the sea" with reverence and affection, than

<P>to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower

<P>reaches of the Thames.&nbsp; The tidal current runs to and

<P>fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of

<P>men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the

<P>battles of the sea.&nbsp; It had known and served all the

<P>men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis

<P>Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and un-

<P>titled--the great knights-errant of the sea.&nbsp; It had

<P>borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing

<P>in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning

<P>with her round flanks full of treasure, to be visited by

<P>the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic

<P>tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests

<P>--and that never returned.&nbsp; It had known the ships and

<P>the men.&nbsp; They had sailed from Deptford, from Green-

<P>wich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;

<P>kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains,

<P>admirals, the dark "interlopers" of the Eastern trade,

<P>and the commissioned "generals" of East India fleets.

<P>Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone

<P>out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the

<P>torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers

<P>of a spark from the sacred fire.&nbsp; What greatness had

<P>not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of

<P>an unknown earth! . . .&nbsp; The dreams of men, the seed

<P>of commonwealths, the germs of empires.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights

<P>began to appear along the shore.&nbsp; The Chapman light-

<P>house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone

<P>strongly.&nbsp; Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a

<P>great stir of lights going up and going down.&nbsp; And

<P>farther west on the upper reaches the place of the mon-

<P>strous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a

<P>brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the

<P>stars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And this also," said Marlow suddenly, "has been

<P>one of the dark places of the earth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was the only man of us who still "followed the

<P>sea."&nbsp; The worst that could be said of him was that

<P>he did not represent his class.&nbsp; He was a seaman, but he

<P>was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may

<P>so express it, a sedentary life.&nbsp; Their minds are of the

<P>stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them

<P>--the ship; and so is their country--the sea.&nbsp; One ship

<P>is very much like another, and the sea is always the same.

<P>In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign

<P>shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life,

<P>glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a

<P>slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mys-

<P>terious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is

<P>the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.

<P>For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or

<P>a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the

<P>secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the

<P>secret not worth knowing.&nbsp; The yarns of seamen have a

<P>direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within

<P>the shell of a cracked nut.&nbsp; But Marlow was not typical

<P>(if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to

<P>him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a

<P>kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it

<P>out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of

<P>one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible

<P>by the spectral illumination of moonshine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His remark did not seem at all surprising.&nbsp; It was

<P>just like Marlow.&nbsp; It was accepted in silence.&nbsp; No one

<P>took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he said,

<P>very slow--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans

<P>first came here, nineteen hundred years ago--the other

<P>day. . . .&nbsp; Light came out of this river since--you

<P>say Knights?&nbsp; Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a

<P>plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds.&nbsp; We live

<P>in the flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps

<P>rolling!&nbsp; But darkness was here yesterday.&nbsp; Imagine

<P>the feelings of a commander of a fine--what d'ye call

<P>'em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered suddenly

<P>to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry;

<P>put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries,--a

<P>wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too--

<P>used to build, apparently by the hundred, in a month

<P>or two, if we may believe what we read.&nbsp; Imagine him

<P>here--the very end of the world, a sea the color of lead,

<P>a sky the color of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid

<P>as a concertina--and going up this river with stores, or

<P>orders, or what you like.&nbsp; Sandbanks, marshes, forests,

<P>savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man,

<P>nothing but Thames water to drink.&nbsp; No Falernian wine

<P>here, no going ashore.&nbsp; Here and there a military camp

<P>lost in a wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay--

<P>cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death,--death

<P>skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush.&nbsp; They

<P>must have been dying like flies here.&nbsp; Oh yes--he did it.

<P>Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking

<P>much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what

<P>he had gone through in his time, perhaps.&nbsp; They were

<P>men enough to face the darkness.&nbsp; And perhaps he was

<P>cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to

<P>the fleet at Ravenna by-and-by, if he had good friends

<P>in Rome and survived the awful climate.&nbsp; Or think of

<P>a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too much

<P>dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some

<P>prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his

<P>fortunes.&nbsp; Land in a swamp, march through the woods,

<P>and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter

<P>savagery, had closed round him,--all that mysterious

<P>life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the

<P>jungles, in the hearts of wild men.&nbsp; There's no initiation

<P>either into such mysteries.&nbsp; He has to live in the midst

<P>of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable.&nbsp; And

<P>it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him.

<P>The fascination of the abomination--you know.

<P>Imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the

<P>powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mind," he began again, lifting one arm from the

<P>elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his

<P>legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha

<P>preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-

<P>flower--"Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this.

<P>What saves us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency.

<P>But these chaps were not much account, really.&nbsp; They

<P>were no colonists; their administration was merely a

<P>squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect.&nbsp; They were con-

<P>querors, and for that you want only brute force--nothing

<P>to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is

<P>just an accident arising from the weakness of others.

<P>They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what

<P>was to be got.&nbsp; It was just robbery with violence, aggra-

<P>vated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind

<P>--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness.&nbsp; The

<P>conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking

<P>it away from those who have a different complexion or

<P>slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing

<P>when you look into it too much.&nbsp; What redeems it is the

<P>idea only.&nbsp; An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental

<P>pretense but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea

<P>--something you can set up, and bow down before, and

<P>offer a sacrifice to. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He broke off.&nbsp; Flames glided in the river, small green

<P>flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking,

<P>joining, crossing each other--then separating slowly or

<P>hastily.&nbsp; The traffic of the great city went on in the

<P>deepening night upon the sleepless river.&nbsp; We looked

<P>on, waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till

<P>the end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence,

<P>when he said, in a hesitating voice, "I suppose you fel-

<P>lows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a

<P>bit," that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began

<P>to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive ex-

<P>periences.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't want to bother you much with what hap-

<P>pened to me personally," he began, showing in this re-

<P>mark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem

<P>so often unaware of what their audience would best like

<P>to hear; "yet to understand the effect of it on me you

<P>ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I

<P>went up that river to the place where I first met the

<P>poor chap.&nbsp; It was the farthest point of navigation and

<P>the culminating point of my experience.&nbsp; It seemed some-

<P>how to throw a kind of light on everything about me--

<P>and into my thoughts.&nbsp; It was somber enough too--and

<P>pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear

<P>either.&nbsp; No, not very clear.&nbsp; And yet it seemed to throw

<P>a kind of light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had then, as you remember, just returned to Lon-

<P>don after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--

<P>a regular dose of the East--six years or so, and I was

<P>loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and

<P>invading your homes, just as though I had got a

<P>heavenly mission to civilize you.&nbsp; It was very fine for

<P>a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting.&nbsp; Then

<P>I began to look for a ship--I should think the hardest

<P>work on earth.&nbsp; But the ships wouldn't even look at me.

<P>And I got tired of that game too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for

<P>maps.&nbsp; I would look for hours at South America, or

<P>Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories

<P>of exploration.&nbsp; At that time there were many blank

<P>spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked

<P>particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that)

<P>I would put my finger on it and say, When I grow up

<P>I will go there.&nbsp; The North Pole was one of these places,

<P>I remember.&nbsp; Well, I haven't been there yet, and shall

<P>not try now.&nbsp; The glamour's off.&nbsp; Other places were

<P>scattered about the Equator, and in every sort of lati-

<P>tude all over the two hemispheres.&nbsp; I have been in some

<P>of them, and . . . well, we won't talk about that.&nbsp; But

<P>there was one yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to

<P>speak--that I had a hankering after.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True, by this time it was not a blank space any

<P>more.&nbsp; It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers

<P>and lakes and names.&nbsp; It had ceased to be a blank space

<P>of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream

<P>gloriously over.&nbsp; It had become a place of darkness.&nbsp; But

<P>there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river,

<P>that you could see on the map, resembling an immense

<P>snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at

<P>rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost

<P>in the depths of the land.&nbsp; And as I looked at the map

<P>of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would

<P>a bird--a silly little bird.&nbsp; Then I remembered there was

<P>a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.&nbsp; Dash

<P>it all!&nbsp; I thought to myself, they can't trade without

<P>using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--

<P>steamboats!&nbsp; Why shouldn't I try to get charge of

<P>one.&nbsp; I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake

<P>off the idea.&nbsp; The snake had charmed me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You understand it was a Continental concern, that

<P>Trading society; but I have a lot of relations living

<P>on the Continent, because it's cheap and not so nasty

<P>as it looks, they say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry to own I began to worry them.&nbsp; This was

<P>already a fresh departure for me.&nbsp; I was not used to

<P>get things that way, you know.&nbsp; I always went my own

<P>road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go.&nbsp; I

<P>wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see

<P>--I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook.

<P>So I worried them.&nbsp; The men said 'My dear fellow,' and

<P>did nothing.&nbsp; Then--would you believe it?--I tried the

<P>women.&nbsp; I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to

<P>get a job.&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; Well, you see, the notion drove

<P>me.&nbsp; I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul.&nbsp; She wrote:

<P>'It will be delightful.&nbsp; I am ready to do anything, any-

<P>thing for you.&nbsp; It is a glorious idea.&nbsp; I know the wife

<P>of a very high personage in the Administration, and

<P>also a man who has lots of influence with,' &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; She

<P>was determined to make no end of fuss to get me ap-

<P>pointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my

<P>fancy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very

<P>quick.&nbsp; It appears the Company had received news that

<P>one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with

<P>the natives.&nbsp; This was my chance, and it made me the

<P>more anxious to go.&nbsp; It was only months and months

<P>afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what

<P>was left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel

<P>arose from a misunderstanding about some hens.&nbsp; Yes,

<P>two black hens.&nbsp; Fresleven--that was the fellow's name,

<P>a Dane--thought himself wronged somehow in the bar-

<P>gain, so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief

<P>of the village with a stick.&nbsp; Oh, it didn't surprise me

<P>in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told

<P>that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that

<P>ever walked on two legs.&nbsp; No doubt he was; but he

<P>had been a couple of years already out there engaged

<P>in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the

<P>need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way.

<P>Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while

<P>a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck,

<P>till some man,--I was told the chief's son,--in despera-

<P>tion at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab

<P>with a spear at the white man--and of course it went

<P>quite easy between the shoulder-blades.&nbsp; Then the whole

<P>population cleared into the forest, expecting all kinds

<P>of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand, the

<P>steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic,

<P>in charge of the engineer, I believe.&nbsp; Afterwards nobody

<P>seemed to trouble much about Fresleven's remains, till

<P>I got out and stepped into his shoes.&nbsp; I couldn't let

<P>it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last

<P>to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his

<P>ribs was tall enough to hide his bones.&nbsp; They were all

<P>there.&nbsp; The supernatural being had not been touched

<P>after he fell.&nbsp; And the village was deserted, the huts

<P>gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen en-

<P>closures.&nbsp; A calamity had come to it, sure enough.&nbsp; The

<P>people had vanished.&nbsp; Mad terror had scattered them,

<P>men, women, and children, through the bush, and they

<P>had never returned.&nbsp; What became of the hens I don't

<P>know either.&nbsp; I should think the cause of progress got

<P>them, anyhow.&nbsp; However, through this glorious affair I

<P>got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope

<P>for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-

<P>eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself

<P>to my employers, and sign the contract.&nbsp; In a very few

<P>hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of

<P>a whited sepulcher.&nbsp; Prejudice no doubt.&nbsp; I had no

<P>difficulty in finding the Company's offices.&nbsp; It was the

<P>biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was

<P>full of it.&nbsp; They were going to run an over-sea empire,

<P>and make no end of coin by trade.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high

<P>houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead

<P>silence, grass sprouting between the stones, imposing

<P>carriage archways right and left, immense double doors

<P>standing ponderously ajar.&nbsp; I slipped through one of

<P>these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase,

<P>as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to.

<P>Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-

<P>bottomed chairs, knitting black wool.&nbsp; The slim one got

<P>up and walked straight at me--still knitting with down-

<P>cast eyes--and only just as I began to think of getting

<P>out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood

<P>still, and looked up.&nbsp; Her dress was as plain as an um-

<P>brella-cover, and she turned round without a word and

<P>preceded me into a waiting-room.&nbsp; I gave my name, and

<P>looked about.&nbsp; Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all

<P>round the walls, on one end a large shining map, marked

<P>with all the colors of a rainbow.&nbsp; There was a vast

<P>amount of red--good to see at any time, because one

<P>knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a

<P>lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the

<P>East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly

<P>pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer.&nbsp; How-

<P>ever, I wasn't going into any of these.&nbsp; I was going

<P>into the yellow.&nbsp; Dead in the center.&nbsp; And the river

<P>was there--fascinating--deadly--like a snake.&nbsp; Ough!

<P>A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but

<P>wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a

<P>skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary.&nbsp; Its

<P>light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the

<P>middle.&nbsp; From behind that structure came out an im-

<P>pression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat.&nbsp; The great

<P>man himself.&nbsp; He was five feet six, I should judge, and

<P>had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions.

<P>He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satis-

<P>fied with my French.&nbsp; Bon voyage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In about forty-five seconds I found myself again in

<P>the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary, who,

<P>full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some

<P>document.&nbsp; I believe I undertook amongst other things

<P>not to disclose any trade secrets.&nbsp; Well, I am not going

<P>to.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I began to feel slightly uneasy.&nbsp; You know I am

<P>not used to such ceremonies, and there was something

<P>ominous in the atmosphere.&nbsp; It was just as though I

<P>had been let into some conspiracy--I don't know--some-

<P>thing not quite right; and I was glad to get out.&nbsp; In

<P>the outer room the two women knitted black wool fever-

<P>ishly.&nbsp; People were arriving, and the younger one was

<P>walking back and forth introducing them.&nbsp; The old

<P>one sat on her chair.&nbsp; Her flat cloth slippers were

<P>propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on

<P>her lap.&nbsp; She wore a starched white affair on her head,

<P>had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles

<P>hung on the tip of her nose.&nbsp; She glanced at me above

<P>the glasses.&nbsp; The swift and indifferent placidity of that

<P>look troubled me.&nbsp; Two youths with foolish and cheery

<P>countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at

<P>them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom.&nbsp; She

<P>seemed to know all about them and about me too.&nbsp; An

<P>eerie feeling came over me.&nbsp; She seemed uncanny and

<P>fateful.&nbsp; Often far away there I thought of these two,

<P>guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as

<P>for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continu-

<P>ously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery

<P>and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes.&nbsp; Ave!&nbsp; Old

<P>knitter of black wool.&nbsp; Morituri te salutant.&nbsp; Not many

<P>of those she looked at ever saw her again--not half,

<P>by a long way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There was yet a visit to the doctor.&nbsp; 'A simple for-

<P>mality,' assured me the secretary, with an air of taking

<P>an immense part in all my sorrows.&nbsp; Accordingly a

<P>young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some

<P>clerk I suppose,--there must have been clerks in the busi-

<P>ness, though the house was as still as a house in a city

<P>of the dead,--came from somewhere up-stairs, and led

<P>me forth.&nbsp; He was shabby and careless, with ink-stains

<P>on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and

<P>billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot.

<P>It was a little too early for the doctor, so I proposed

<P>a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality.

<P>As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Company's

<P>business, and by-and-by I expressed casually my sur-

<P>prise at him not going out there.&nbsp; He became very cool

<P>and collected all at once.&nbsp; 'I am not such a fool as I

<P>look, quoth Plato to his disciples,' he said sententiously,

<P>emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of

<P>something else the while.&nbsp; 'Good, good for there,' he

<P>mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me

<P>whether I would let him measure my head.&nbsp; Rather sur-

<P>prised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers

<P>and got the dimensions back and front and every way,

<P>taking notes carefully.&nbsp; He was an unshaven little man

<P>in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in

<P>slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool.&nbsp; 'I always

<P>ask leave, in the interests of science, to measure the

<P>crania of those going out there,' he said.&nbsp; 'And when

<P>they come back too?' I asked.&nbsp; "Oh, I never see them,'

<P>he remarked; 'and, moreover, the changes take place in-

<P>side, you know.'&nbsp; He smiled, as if at some quiet joke.

<P>'So you are going out there.&nbsp; Famous.&nbsp; Interesting too.'

<P>He gave me a searching glance, and made another note.

<P>'Ever any madness in your family?' he asked, in a

<P>matter-of-fact tone.&nbsp; I felt very annoyed.&nbsp; 'Is that

<P>question in the interests of science too?'&nbsp; 'It would be,'

<P>he said, without taking notice of my irritation, 'interest-

<P>ing for science to watch the mental changes of individ-

<P>uals, on the spot, but . . .'&nbsp; 'Are you an alienist?' I

<P>interrupted.&nbsp; 'Every doctor should be--a little,' an-

<P>swered that original, imperturbably.&nbsp; 'I have a little

<P>theory which you Messieurs who go out there must help

<P>me to prove.&nbsp; This is my share in the advantages my

<P>country shall reap from the possession of such a mag-

<P>nificent dependency.&nbsp; The mere wealth I leave to others.

<P>Pardon my questions, but you are the first Englishman

<P>coming under my observation. . . .'&nbsp; I hastened to

<P>assure him I was not in the least typical.&nbsp; 'If I were,'

<P>said I, 'I wouldn't be talking like this with you.'&nbsp; 'What

<P>you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous,' he

<P>said, with a laugh.&nbsp; 'Avoid irritation more than expos-

<P>ure to the sun.&nbsp; Adieu.&nbsp; How do you English say, eh?

<P>Good-by.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Good-by.&nbsp; Adieu.&nbsp; In the tropics
one

<P>must before everything keep calm.' . . .&nbsp; He lifted a

<P>warning forefinger. . . .&nbsp; 'Du calme, du calme.

<P>Adieu.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One thing more remained to do--say good-by to

<P>my excellent aunt.&nbsp; I found her triumphant.&nbsp; I had a

<P>cup of tea--the last decent cup of tea for many days

<P>--and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you

<P>would expect a lady's drawing-room to look, we had a

<P>long quiet chat by the fireside.&nbsp; In the course of these

<P>confidences it became quite plain to me I had been repre-

<P>sented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness

<P>knows to how many more people besides, as an excep-

<P>tional and gifted creature--a piece of good fortune for

<P>the Company--a man you don't get hold of every day.

<P>Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of a

<P>two-penny-halfpenny river-steamboat with a penny

<P>whistle attached!&nbsp; It appeared, however, I was also one

<P>of the Workers, with a capital--you know.&nbsp; Something

<P>like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort

<P>of apostle.&nbsp; There had been a lot of such rot let loose

<P>in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent

<P>woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got

<P>carried off her feet.&nbsp; She talked about 'weaning those

<P>ignorant millions from their horrid ways,' till, upon my

<P>word, she made me quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; I ventured to

<P>hint that the Company was run for profit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'You forget, dear Charlie, that the laborer is worthy

<P>of his hire,' she said, brightly.&nbsp; It's queer how out of

<P>touch with truth women are.&nbsp; They live in a world of

<P>their own, and there had never been anything like it,

<P>and never can be.&nbsp; It is too beautiful altogether, and

<P>if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before

<P>the first sunset.&nbsp; Some confounded fact we men have

<P>been living contentedly with ever since the day of cre-

<P>ation would start up and knock the whole thing over.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be

<P>sure to write often, and so on--and I left.&nbsp; In the street

<P>--I don't know why--a queer feeling came to me that I

<P>was an impostor.&nbsp; Odd thing that I, who used to clear

<P>out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours'

<P>notice, with less thought than most men give to the cross-

<P>ing of a street, had a moment--I won't say of hesitation,

<P>but of startled pause, before this commonplace affair.

<P>The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that,

<P>for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going

<P>to the center of a continent, I were about to set off for

<P>the center of the earth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I left in a French steamer, and she called in every

<P>blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could

<P>see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-

<P>house officers.&nbsp; I watched the coast.&nbsp; Watching a coast

<P>as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma.

<P>There it is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting,

<P>grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with

<P>an air of whispering, Come and find out.&nbsp; This one was

<P>almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an

<P>aspect of monotonous grimness.&nbsp; The edge of a colossal

<P>jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed

<P>with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far

<P>away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a

<P>creeping mist.&nbsp; The sun was fierce, the land seemed to

<P>glisten and drip with steam.&nbsp; Here and there grayish-

<P>whitish specks showed up, clustered inside the white surf,

<P>with a flag flying above them perhaps.&nbsp; Settlements some

<P>centuries old, and still no bigger than pin-heads on the

<P>untouched expanse of their background.&nbsp; We pounded

<P>along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-

<P>house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-for-

<P>saken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in

<P>it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the custom-

<P>house clerks, presumably.&nbsp; Some, I heard, got drowned

<P>in the surf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed

<P>particularly to care.&nbsp; They were just flung out there,

<P>and on we went.&nbsp; Every day the coast looked the same,

<P>as though we had not moved; but we passed various

<P>places--trading places--with names like Gran' Bassam

<P>Little Popo, names that seemed to belong to some sordid

<P>farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth.&nbsp; The idle-

<P>ness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men

<P>with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and lan-

<P>guid sea, the uniform somberness of the coast, seemed

<P>to keep me away from the truth of things, within the

<P>toil of a mournful and senseless delusion.&nbsp; The voice of

<P>the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure,

<P>like the speech of a brother.&nbsp; It was something natural,

<P>that had its reason, that had a meaning.&nbsp; Now and then

<P>a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact

<P>with reality.&nbsp; It was paddled by black fellows.&nbsp; You

<P>could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glisten-

<P>ing.&nbsp; They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with

<P>perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks--these

<P>chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an in-

<P>tense energy of movement, that was as natural and true

<P>as the surf along their coast.&nbsp; They wanted no excuse

<P>for being there.&nbsp; They were a great comfort to look at.

<P>For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of

<P>straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last

<P>long.&nbsp; Something would turn up to scare it away.&nbsp; Once,

<P>I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off

<P>the coast.&nbsp; There wasn't even a shed there, and she

<P>was shelling the bush.&nbsp; It appears the French had one

<P>of their wars going on thereabouts.&nbsp; Her ensign dropped

<P>limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long eight-inch guns

<P>stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell

<P>swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin

<P>masts.&nbsp; In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water,

<P>there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent.

<P>Pop, would go one of the eight-inch guns; a small flame

<P>would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would dis-

<P>appear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech--

<P>and nothing happened.&nbsp; Nothing could happen.&nbsp; There

<P>was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of

<P>lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissi-

<P>pated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there

<P>was a camp of natives--he called them enemies!--hidden

<P>out of sight somewhere.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We gave her her letters (I heard the men in that

<P>lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three

<P>a day) and went on.&nbsp; We called at some more places with

<P>farcical names, where the merry dance of death and

<P>trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an

<P>overheated catacomb; all along the formless coast bor-

<P>dered by dangerous surf, as if Nature herself had tried

<P>to ward off intruders; in and out of rivers, streams of

<P>death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose

<P>waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted man-

<P>groves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of

<P>an impotent despair.&nbsp; Nowhere did we stop long enough

<P>to get a particularized impression, but the general sense

<P>of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me.&nbsp; It was

<P>like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for night-

<P>mares.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth

<P>of the big river.&nbsp; We anchored off the seat of the gov-

<P>ernment.&nbsp; But my work would not begin till some two

<P>hundred miles farther on.&nbsp; So as soon as I could I made

<P>a start for a place thirty miles higher up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer.&nbsp; Her

<P>captain was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman,

<P>invited me on the bridge.&nbsp; He was a young man, lean,

<P>fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait.

<P>As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head

<P>contemptuously at the shore.&nbsp; 'Been living there?' he

<P>asked.&nbsp; I said, 'Yes.'&nbsp; 'Fine lot these government chaps

<P>--are they not?' he went on, speaking English with

<P>great precision and considerable bitterness.&nbsp; 'It is funny

<P>what some people will do for a few francs a month.&nbsp; I

<P>wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up coun-

<P>try?'&nbsp; I said to him I expected to see that soon.&nbsp; 'So-o-o!'

<P>he exclaimed.&nbsp; He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye

<P>ahead vigilantly.&nbsp; 'Don't be too sure,' he continued.

<P>'The other day I took up a man who hanged himself

<P>on the road.&nbsp; He was a Swede, too.'&nbsp; 'Hanged himself!

<P>Why, in God's name?' I cried.&nbsp; He kept on looking out

<P>watchfully.&nbsp; 'Who knows?&nbsp; The sun too much for him,

<P>or the country perhaps.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At last we opened a reach.&nbsp; A rocky cliff appeared,

<P>mounds of turned-up earth by the shore, houses on a

<P>hill, others, with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excava-

<P>tions, or hanging to the declivity.&nbsp; A continuous noise

<P>of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited

<P>devastation.&nbsp; A lot of people, mostly black and naked,

<P>moved about like ants.&nbsp; A jetty projected into the river.

<P>A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden

<P>recrudescence of glare.&nbsp; 'There's your Company's sta-

<P>tion,' said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-

<P>like structures on the rocky slope.&nbsp; 'I will send your

<P>things up.&nbsp; Four boxes did you say?&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Farewell.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then

<P>found a path leading up the hill.&nbsp; It turned aside for

<P>the bowlders, and also for an undersized railway-truck

<P>lying there on its back with its wheels in the air.&nbsp; One

<P>was off.&nbsp; The thing looked as dead as the carcass of

<P>some animal.&nbsp; I came upon more pieces of decaying ma-

<P>chinery, a stack of rusty rails.&nbsp; To the left a clump of

<P>trees made a shady spot, where dark things seemed to

<P>stir feebly.&nbsp; I blinked, the path was steep.&nbsp; A horn tooted

<P>to the right, and I saw the black people run.&nbsp; A heavy

<P>and dull detonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke

<P>came out of the cliff, and that was all.&nbsp; No change ap-

<P>peared on the face of the rock.&nbsp; They were building a

<P>railway.&nbsp; The cliff was not in the way or anything; but

<P>this objectless blasting was all the work going on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head.

<P>Six black men advanced in a file, toiling up the path.

<P>They walked erect and slow, balancing small baskets

<P>full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept time with

<P>their footsteps.&nbsp; Black rags were wound round their

<P>loins, and the short ends behind wagged to and fro like

<P>tails.&nbsp; I could see every rib, the joints of their limbs

<P>were like knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on

<P>his neck, and all were connected together with a chain

<P>whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking.

<P>Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly

<P>of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent.

<P>It was the same kind of ominous voice; but these men

<P>could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies.

<P>They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like

<P>the bursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mys-

<P>tery from over the sea.&nbsp; All their meager breasts panted

<P>together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes

<P>stared stonily uphill.&nbsp; They passed me within six inches,

<P>without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indif-

<P>ference of unhappy savages.&nbsp; Behind this raw matter

<P>one of the reclaimed, the product of the new forces at

<P>work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its

<P>middle.&nbsp; He had a uniform jacket with one button off,

<P>and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted his weapon

<P>to his shoulder with alacrity.&nbsp; This was simple prudence,

<P>white men being so much alike at a distance that he could

<P>not tell who I might be.&nbsp; He was speedily reassured, and

<P>with a large, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his

<P>charge, seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted

<P>trust.&nbsp; After all, I also was a part of the great cause

<P>of these high and just proceedings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Instead of going up, I turned and descended to the

<P>left.&nbsp; My idea was to let that chain-gang get out of

<P>sight before I climbed the hill.&nbsp; You know I am not par-

<P>ticularly tender; I've had to strike and to fend off.&nbsp; I've

<P>had to resist and to attack sometimes--that's only one

<P>way of resisting--without counting the exact cost, ac-

<P>cording to the demands of such sort of life as I had blun-

<P>dered into.&nbsp; I've seen the devil of violence, and the devil

<P>of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the

<P>stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that

<P>swayed and drove men--men, I tell you.&nbsp; But as I stood

<P>on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine

<P>of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby,

<P>pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless

<P>folly.&nbsp; How insidious he could be, too, I was only to

<P>find out several months later and a thousand miles

<P>farther.&nbsp; For a moment I stood appalled, as though by

<P>a warning.&nbsp; Finally I descended the hill, obliquely, to-

<P>wards the trees I had seen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been

<P>digging on the slope, the purpose of which I found it

<P>impossible to divine.&nbsp; It wasn't a quarry or a sandpit,

<P>anyhow.&nbsp; It was just a hole.&nbsp; It might have been con-

<P>nected with the philanthropic desire of giving the crim-

<P>inals something to do.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Then I nearly

<P>fell into a very narrow ravine, almost no more than a

<P>scar in the hillside.&nbsp; I discovered that a lot of imported

<P>drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in

<P>there.&nbsp; There wasn't one that was not broken.&nbsp; It was

<P>a wanton smash-up.&nbsp; At last I got under the trees.&nbsp; My

<P>purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment; but

<P>no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped

<P>into a gloomy circle of some Inferno.&nbsp; The rapids were

<P>near, and an uninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing

<P>noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove, where not

<P>a breath stirred, not a leaf moved, with a mysterious

<P>sound--as though the tearing pace of the launched earth

<P>had suddenly become audible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees,

<P>leaning against the trunks, clinging to the earth, half

<P>coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in all the

<P>attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair.&nbsp; Another

<P>mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder

<P>of the soil under my feet.&nbsp; The work was going on.&nbsp; The

<P>work!&nbsp; And this was the place where some of the helpers

<P>had withdrawn to die.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They were dying slowly--it was very clear.&nbsp; They

<P>were not enemies, they were not criminals, they were

<P>nothing earthly now,--nothing but black shadows of

<P>disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish

<P>gloom.&nbsp; Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all

<P>the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial sur-

<P>roundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, be-

<P>came inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl away and

<P>rest.&nbsp; These moribund shapes were free as air--and

<P>nearly as thin.&nbsp; I began to distinguish the gleam of eyes

<P>under the trees.&nbsp; Then, glancing down, I saw a face

<P>near my hand.&nbsp; The black bones reclined at full length

<P>with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eye-

<P>lids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous

<P>and vacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths

<P>of the orbs, which died out slowly.&nbsp; The man seemed

<P>young--almost a boy--but you know with them it's hard

<P>to tell.&nbsp; I found nothing else to do but to offer him one

<P>of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket.

<P>The fingers closed slowly on it and held--there was no

<P>other movement and no other glance.&nbsp; He had tied a bit

<P>of white worsted round his neck--Why?&nbsp; Where did he

<P>get it?&nbsp; Was it a badge--an ornament--a charm--a

<P>propitiatory act?&nbsp; Was there any idea at all connected

<P>with it?&nbsp; It looked startling round his black neck, this

<P>bit of white thread from beyond the seas.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles

<P>sat with their legs drawn up.&nbsp; One, with his chin

<P>propped on his knees, stared at nothing, in an intoler-

<P>able and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested

<P>its forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and

<P>all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted

<P>collapse, as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence.

<P>While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose

<P>to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards

<P>the river to drink.&nbsp; He lapped out of his hand, then sat

<P>up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him,

<P>and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breast-

<P>bone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I didn't want any more loitering in the shade, and

<P>I made haste towards the station.&nbsp; When near the build-

<P>ings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance

<P>of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort

<P>of vision.&nbsp; I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a

<P>light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clear necktie, and

<P>varnished boots.&nbsp; No hat.&nbsp; Hair parted, brushed, oiled,

<P>under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand.

<P>He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was

<P>the Company's chief accountant, and that all the book-

<P>keeping was done at this station.&nbsp; He had come out for

<P>a moment, he said, 'to get a breath of fresh air.'&nbsp; The

<P>expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion

<P>of sedentary desk-life.&nbsp; I wouldn't have mentioned the

<P>fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I

<P>first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly

<P>connected with the memories of that time.&nbsp; Moreover, I

<P>respected the fellow.&nbsp; Yes; I respected his collars, his

<P>vast cuffs, his brushed hair.&nbsp; His appearance was cer-

<P>tainly that of a hairdresser's dummy; but in the great

<P>demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance.

<P>That's backbone.&nbsp; His starched collars and got-up shirt-

<P>fronts were achievements of character.&nbsp; He had been out

<P>nearly three years; and, later on, I could not help ask-

<P>ing him how he managed to sport such linen.&nbsp; He had

<P>just the faintest blush, and said modestly, 'I've been

<P>teaching one of the native women about the station.&nbsp; It

<P>was difficult.&nbsp; She had a distaste for the work.'&nbsp; This

<P>man had verily accomplished something.&nbsp; And he was

<P>devoted to his books, which were in apple-pie order.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Everything else in the station was in a muddle,--

<P>heads, things, buildings.&nbsp; Strings of dusty niggers with

<P>splay feet arrived and departed; a stream of manu-

<P>factured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and brass-wire

<P>set into the depths of darkness, and in return came a

<P>precious trickle of ivory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had to wait in the station for ten days--an eternity.

<P>I lived in a hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos

<P>I would sometimes get into the accountant's office.&nbsp; It

<P>was built of horizontal planks, and so badly put together

<P>that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from

<P>neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight.&nbsp; There was

<P>no need to open the big shutter to see.&nbsp; It was hot

<P>there too; big flies buzzed fiendishly, and did not sting,

<P>but stabbed.&nbsp; I sat generally on the floor, while, of

<P>faultless appearance (and even slightly scented), perch-

<P>ing on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote.&nbsp; Sometimes he

<P>stood up for exercise.&nbsp; When a truckle-bed with a sick

<P>man (some invalided agent from up-country) was put in

<P>there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance.&nbsp; 'The groans of

<P>this sick person,' he said, distract my attention.&nbsp; And

<P>without that it is extremely difficult to guard against

<P>clerical errors in this climate.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One day he remarked, without lifting his head, "In

<P>the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.'&nbsp; On my

<P>asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said he was a first-class

<P>agent; and seeing my disappointment at this informa-

<P>tion, he added slowly, laying down his pen, 'He is a very

<P>remarkable person.'&nbsp; Further questions elicited from him

<P>that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading

<P>post, a very important one, in the true ivory-country,

<P>at 'the very bottom of there.&nbsp; Sends in as much ivory

<P>as all the others put together. . . .'&nbsp; He began to

<P>write again.&nbsp; The sick man was too ill to groan.&nbsp; The

<P>flies buzzed in a great peace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and

<P>a great tramping of feet.&nbsp; A caravan had come in.&nbsp; A

<P>violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other

<P>side of the planks.&nbsp; All the carriers were speaking to-

<P>gether, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable

<P>voice of the chief agent was heard 'giving it up' tear-

<P>fully for the twentieth time that day. . . .&nbsp; He rose

<P>slowly.&nbsp; 'What a frightful row,' he said.&nbsp; He crossed

<P>the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning,

<P>said to me, 'He does not hear.'&nbsp; 'What!&nbsp; Dead?' I

<P>asked, startled.&nbsp; 'No, not yet,' he answered, with great

<P>composure.&nbsp; Then, alluding with a toss of the head to

<P>the tumult in the station-yard, 'When one has got to

<P>make correct entries, one comes to hate those savages--

<P>hate them to the death.'&nbsp; He remained thoughtful for a

<P>moment.&nbsp; 'When you see Mr. Kurtz,' he went on, 'tell

<P>him from me that everything here'--he glanced at the

<P>desk--'is very satisfactory.&nbsp; I don't like to write to him

<P>--with those messengers of ours you never know who

<P>may get hold of your letter--at that Central Station.'

<P>He stared at me for a moment with his mild, bulging

<P>eyes.&nbsp; 'Oh, he will go far, very far,' he began again.

<P>'He will be a somebody in the Administration before

<P>long.&nbsp; They, above--the Council in Europe, you know

<P>--mean him to be.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He turned to his work.&nbsp; The noise outside had ceased,

<P>and presently in going out I stopped at the door.&nbsp; In

<P>the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound agent was

<P>lying flushed and insensible; the other, bent over his

<P>books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct

<P>transactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could

<P>see the still tree-tops of the grove of death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan

<P>of sixty men, for a two-hundred-mile tramp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No use telling you much about that.&nbsp; Paths, paths,

<P>everywhere; a stamped-in network of paths spreading

<P>over the empty land, through long grass, through burnt

<P>grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up

<P>and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude,

<P>a solitude, nobody, not a hut.&nbsp; The population had

<P>cleared out a long time ago.&nbsp; Well, if a lot of mysterious

<P>niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons sud-

<P>denly took to traveling on the road between Deal and

<P>Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry

<P>heavy loads for them, I fancy every farm and cottage

<P>thereabouts would get empty very soon.&nbsp; Only here the

<P>dwellings were gone too.&nbsp; Still I passed through several

<P>abandoned villages.&nbsp; There's something pathetically

<P>childish in the ruins of grass walls.&nbsp; Day after day, with

<P>the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind

<P>me, each pair under a 60-lb. load.&nbsp; Camp, cook, sleep,

<P>strike camp, march.&nbsp; Now and then a carrier dead in

<P>harness, at rest in the long grass near the path, with

<P>an empty water-gourd and his long staff lying by his

<P>side.&nbsp; A great silence around and above.&nbsp; Perhaps on

<P>some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking,

<P>swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing,

<P>suggestive, and wild--and perhaps with as profound a

<P>meaning as the sound of bells in a Christian country.

<P>Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping

<P>on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris,

<P>very hospitable and festive--not to say drunk.&nbsp; Was

<P>looking after the upkeep of the road, he declared.&nbsp; Can't

<P>say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless the body of a

<P>middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead,

<P>upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther on,

<P>may be considered as a permanent improvement.&nbsp; I had

<P>a white companion too, not a bad chap, but rather too

<P>fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on

<P>the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade

<P>and water.&nbsp; Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat

<P>like a parasol over a man's head while he is coming-to.

<P>I couldn't help asking him once what he meant by coming

<P>there at all.&nbsp; 'To make money, of course.&nbsp; What do

<P>you think?' he said, scornfully.&nbsp; Then he got fever, and

<P>had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole.&nbsp; As

<P>he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the

<P>carriers.&nbsp; They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their

<P>loads in the night--quite a mutiny.&nbsp; So, one evening,

<P>I made a speech in English with gestures, not one of

<P>which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and

<P>the next morning I started the hammock off in front all

<P>right.&nbsp; An afterwards I came upon the whole con-

<P>cern wrecked in a bush--man, hammock, groans, blankets,

<P>horrors.&nbsp; The heavy pole had skinned his poor nose.&nbsp; He

<P>was very anxious for me to kill somebody, but there

<P>wasn't the shadow of a carrier near.&nbsp; I remembered the

<P>old doctor,--'It would be interesting for science to

<P>watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot.'

<P>I felt I was becoming scientifically interesting.&nbsp; How-

<P>ever, all that is to no purpose.&nbsp; On the fifteenth day I

<P>came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into

<P>the Central Station.&nbsp; It was on a back water surrounded

<P>by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud

<P>on one side, and on the three others inclosed by a crazy

<P>fence of rushes.&nbsp; A neglected gap was all the gate it

<P>had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let

<P>you see the flabby devil was running that show.&nbsp; White

<P>men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly

<P>from amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look

<P>at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere.&nbsp; One

<P>of them, a stout, excitable chap with black mustaches,

<P>informed me with great volubility and many digressions,

<P>as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at

<P>the bottom of the river.&nbsp; I was thunderstruck.&nbsp; What,

<P>how, why?&nbsp; Oh, it was 'all right.'&nbsp; The 'manager him-

<P>self' was there.&nbsp; All quite correct.&nbsp; 'Everybody had

<P>behaved splendidly! splendidly!'--'you must,' he said

<P>in agitation, 'go and see the general manager at once.

<P>He is waiting!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did not see the real significance of that wreck at

<P>once.&nbsp; I fancy I see it now, but I am not sure--not at

<P>all.&nbsp; Certainly the affair was too stupid--when I think

<P>of it--to be altogether natural.&nbsp; Still. . . .&nbsp; But at the

<P>moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nui-

<P>sance.&nbsp; The steamer was sunk.&nbsp; They had started two

<P>days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the

<P>manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skipper,

<P>and before they had been out three hours they tore the

<P>bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south

<P>bank.&nbsp; I asked myself what I was to do there, now my

<P>boat was lost.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I had plenty to do

<P>in fishing my command out of the river.&nbsp; I had to set

<P>about it the very next day.&nbsp; That, and the repairs when

<P>I brought the pieces to the station, took some months.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My first interview with the manager was curious.&nbsp; He

<P>did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk

<P>that morning.&nbsp; He was commonplace in complexion, in

<P>feature, in manners, and in voice.&nbsp; He was of middle

<P>size and of ordinary build.&nbsp; His eyes, of the usual blue,

<P>were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could

<P>make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as

<P>an ax.&nbsp; But even at these times the rest of his person

<P>seemed to disclaim the intention.&nbsp; Otherwise there was

<P>only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, some-

<P>thing stealthy--a smile--not a smile--I remember it, but

<P>I can't explain.&nbsp; It was unconscious, this smile was,

<P>though just after he had said something it got intensified

<P>for an instant.&nbsp; It came at the end of his speeches like

<P>a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the

<P>commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable.&nbsp; He

<P>was a common trader, from his youth up employed in

<P>these parts--nothing more.&nbsp; He was obeyed, yet he in-

<P>spired neither love nor fear, nor even respect.&nbsp; He in-

<P>spired uneasiness.&nbsp; That was it!&nbsp; Uneasiness.&nbsp; Not a

<P>definite mistrust--just uneasiness--nothing more.&nbsp; You

<P>have no idea how effective such a . . . a . . . fac-

<P>ulty can be.&nbsp; He had no genius for organizing, for

<P>initiative, or for order even.&nbsp; That was evident in such

<P>things as the deplorable state of the station.&nbsp; He had

<P>no learning, and no intelligence.&nbsp; His position had come

<P>to him--why?&nbsp; Perhaps because he was never ill . . .

<P>He had served three terms of three years out there . . .

<P>Because triumphant health in the general rout of con-

<P>stitutions is a kind of power in itself.&nbsp; When he went

<P>home on leave he rioted on a large scale--pompously.

<P>Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only.&nbsp; This

<P>one could gather from his casual talk.&nbsp; He originated

<P>nothing, he could keep the routine going--that's all.

<P>But he was great.&nbsp; He was great by this little thing that

<P>it was impossible to tell what could control such a man.

<P>He never gave that secret away.&nbsp; Perhaps there was

<P>nothing within him.&nbsp; Such a suspicion made one pause

<P>--for out there there were no external checks.&nbsp; Once

<P>when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every

<P>'agent' in the station, he was heard to say, 'Men who

<P>come out here should have no entrails.'&nbsp; He sealed the

<P>utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been

<P>a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping.

<P>You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on.

<P>When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels

<P>of the white men about precedence, he ordered an im-

<P>mense round table to be made, for which a special house

<P>had to be built.&nbsp; This was the station's mess-room.&nbsp; Where

<P>he sat was the first place--the rest were nowhere.&nbsp; One

<P>felt this to be his unalterable conviction.&nbsp; He was neither

<P>civil nor uncivil.&nbsp; He was quiet.&nbsp; He allowed his 'boy'

<P>--an overfed young negro from the coast--to treat the

<P>white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He began to speak as soon as he saw me.&nbsp; I had

<P>been very long on the road.&nbsp; He could not wait.&nbsp; Had

<P>to start without me.&nbsp; The up-river stations had to be

<P>relieved.&nbsp; There had been so many delays already that

<P>he did not know who was dead and who was alive, and

<P>how they got on--and so on, and so on.&nbsp; He paid no

<P>attention to my explanations, and, playing with a stick

<P>of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation

<P>was 'very grave, very grave.'&nbsp; There were rumors that

<P>a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief,

<P>Mr. Kurtz, was ill.&nbsp; Hoped it was not true.&nbsp; Mr. Kurtz

<P>was . . .&nbsp; I felt weary and irritable.&nbsp; Hang Kurtz, I

<P>thought.&nbsp; I interrupted him by saying I had heard of

<P>Mr. Kurtz on the coast.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; So they talk of him

<P>down there,' he murmured to himself.&nbsp; Then he began

<P>again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he

<P>had, an exceptional man, of the greatest importance to

<P>the Company; therefore I could understand his anxiety.

<P>He was, he said, 'very, very uneasy.'&nbsp; Certainly he

<P>fidget on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, 'Ah, Mr.

<P>Kurtz!' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumb-

<P>founded by the accident.&nbsp; Next thing he wanted to know

<P>'how long it would take to' . . .&nbsp; I interrupted him

<P>again.&nbsp; Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet

<P>too, I was getting savage.&nbsp; 'How could I tell,' I said.

<P>'I hadn't even seen the wreck yet--some months, no

<P>doubt.'&nbsp; All this talk seemed to me so futile.&nbsp; 'Some

<P>months,' he said.&nbsp; 'Well, let us say three months before

<P>we can make a start.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That ought to do the affair.'

<P>I flung out of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut

<P>with a sort of veranda) muttering to myself my opinion

<P>of him.&nbsp; He was a chattering idiot.&nbsp; Afterwards I took

<P>it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with

<P>what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite

<P>for the 'affair.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak,

<P>my back on that station.&nbsp; In that way only it seemed

<P>to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of

<P>life.&nbsp; Still, one must look about sometimes; and then I

<P>saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in

<P>the sunshine of the yard.&nbsp; I asked myself sometimes what

<P>it all meant.&nbsp; They wandered here and there with their

<P>absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless

<P>pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence.&nbsp; The word

<P>'ivory' rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed.&nbsp; You

<P>would think they were praying to it.&nbsp; A taint of imbecile

<P>rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some

<P>corpse.&nbsp; By Jove!&nbsp; I've never seen anything so unreal

<P>in my life.&nbsp; And outside, the silent wilderness surround-

<P>ing this cleared speck on the earth struck me as some-

<P>thing great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting

<P>patiently for the passing away of this fantastic in-

<P>vasion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, these months!&nbsp; Well, never mind.&nbsp; Various things

<P>happened.&nbsp; One evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton

<P>prints, beads, and I don't know what else, burst into a

<P>blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth

<P>had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash.

<P>I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer,

<P>and saw them all cutting capers in the light, with their

<P>arms lifted high, when the stout man with mustaches

<P>came tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand,

<P>assured me that everybody was 'behaving splendidly,

<P>splendidly, dipped about a quart of water and tore back

<P>again.&nbsp; I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his

<P>pail.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I strolled up.&nbsp; There was no hurry.&nbsp; You see the

<P>thing had gone off like a box of matches.&nbsp; It had been

<P>hopeless from the very first.&nbsp; The flame had leaped high,

<P>driven everybody back, lighted up everything--and col-

<P>lapsed.&nbsp; The shed was already a heap of embers glowing

<P>fiercely.&nbsp; A nigger was being beaten near by.&nbsp; They

<P>said he had caused the fire in some way; be that as it

<P>may, he was screeching most horribly.&nbsp; I saw him, later

<P>on, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking

<P>very sick and trying to recover himself: afterwards he

<P>arose and went out--and the wilderness without a sound

<P>took him into its bosom again.&nbsp; As I approached the

<P>glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two

<P>men, talking.&nbsp; I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced,

<P>then the words, 'take advantage of this unfortunate ac-

<P>cident.'&nbsp; One of the men was the manager.&nbsp; I wished

<P>him a good evening.&nbsp; 'Did you ever see anything like

<P>it--eh? it is incredible,' he said, and walked off.&nbsp; The

<P>other man remained.&nbsp; He was a first-class agent, young,

<P>gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard

<P>and a hooked nose.&nbsp; He was stand-offish with the other

<P>agents, and they on their side said he was the manager's

<P>spy upon them.&nbsp; As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to

<P>him before.&nbsp; We got into talk, and by-and-by we strolled

<P>away from the hissing ruins.&nbsp; Then he asked me to his

<P>room, which was in the main building of the station.

<P>He struck a match, and I perceived that this young

<P>aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case

<P>but also a whole candle all to himself.&nbsp; Just at that time

<P>the manager was the only man supposed to have any

<P>right to candles.&nbsp; Native mats covered the clay walls;

<P>a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung

<P>up in trophies.&nbsp; The business intrusted to this fellow

<P>was the making of bricks--so I had been informed; but

<P>there wasn't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the sta-

<P>tion, and he had been there more than a year--waiting.

<P>It seems he could not make bricks without something, I

<P>don't know what--straw maybe.&nbsp; Anyways, it could not

<P>be found there, and as it was not likely to be sent from

<P>Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was wait-

<P>ing for.&nbsp; An act of special creation perhaps.&nbsp; However,

<P>they were all waiting--all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims

<P>of them--for something; and upon my word it did not

<P>seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took

<P>it, though the only thing that ever came to them was

<P>disease--as far as I could see.&nbsp; They beguiled the time

<P>by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a

<P>foolish kind of way.&nbsp; There was an air of plotting about

<P>that station, but nothing came of it, of course.&nbsp; It was

<P>as unreal as everything else--as the philanthropic pre-

<P>tense of the whole concern, as their talk, as their gov-

<P>ernment, as their show of work.&nbsp; The only real feeling

<P>was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where

<P>ivory was to be had, so that they could earn percentages.

<P>They intrigued and slandered and hated each other only

<P>on that account,--but as to effectually lifting a little

<P>finger--oh, no.&nbsp; By heavens! there is something after

<P>all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while

<P>another must not look at a halter.&nbsp; Steal a horse straight

<P>out.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; He has done it.&nbsp; Perhaps he can ride.

<P>But there is a way of looking at a halter that would

<P>provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as

<P>we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fel-

<P>low was trying to get at something--in fact, pumping

<P>me.&nbsp; He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I

<P>was supposed to know there--putting leading questions

<P>as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city, and so on.

<P>His little eyes glittered like mica discs--with curiosity,

<P>--though he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness.

<P>At first I was astonished, but very soon I became awfully

<P>curious to see what he would find out from me.&nbsp; I couldn't

<P>possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth

<P>his while.&nbsp; It was very pretty to see how he baffled him-

<P>self, for in truth my body was full of chills, and my

<P>head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat busi-

<P>ness.&nbsp; It was evident he took me for a perfectly shame-

<P>less prevaricator.&nbsp; At last he got angry, and to conceal

<P>a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned.&nbsp; I rose.

<P>Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, repre-

<P>senting a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a

<P>lighted torch.&nbsp; The background was somber--almost

<P>black.&nbsp; The movement of the woman was stately, and

<P>the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding a

<P>half-pint champagne bottle (medical comforts) with the

<P>candle stuck in it.&nbsp; To my question he said Mr. Kurtz

<P>had painted this--in this very station more than a year

<P>ago--while waiting for means to go to his trading-post.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>'Tell me, pray,' said I, 'who is this Mr. Kurtz?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'The chief of the Inner Station,' he answered in a

<P>short tone, looking away.&nbsp; 'Much obliged,' I said, laugh-

<P>ing.&nbsp; 'And you are the brickmaker of the Central Sta-

<P>tion.&nbsp; Everyone knows that.'&nbsp; He was silent for a while.

<P>'He is a prodigy,' he said at last.&nbsp; 'He is an emissary of

<P>pity, and science, and progress, and devil knows what

<P>else.&nbsp; We want,' he began to declaim suddenly, 'for

<P>the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by Europe, so

<P>to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a single-

<P>ness of purpose.'&nbsp; 'Who says that?' I asked.&nbsp; 'Lots of

<P>them,' he replied.&nbsp; 'Some even write that; and so HE

<P>comes here, a special being, as you ought to know.'&nbsp; 'Why

<P>ought I to know?' I interrupted, really surprised.&nbsp; He

<P>paid no attention.&nbsp; 'Yes.&nbsp; To-day he is chief of the

<P>best station, next year he will be assistant-manager, two

<P>years more and . . . but I dare say you know what he

<P>will be in two years' time.&nbsp; You are of the new gang--

<P>the gang of virtue.&nbsp; The same people who sent him

<P>specially also recommended you.&nbsp; Oh, don't say no.&nbsp; I've

<P>my own eyes to trust.'&nbsp; Light dawned upon me.&nbsp; My

<P>dear aunt's influential acquaintances were producing an

<P>unexpected effect upon that young man.&nbsp; I nearly burst

<P>into a laugh.&nbsp; 'Do you read the Company's confidential

<P>correspondence?' I asked.&nbsp; He hadn't a word to say.&nbsp; It

<P>was great fun.&nbsp; 'When Mr. Kurtz,' I continued severely,

<P>'is General Manager, you won't have the opportunity.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went out-

<P>side.&nbsp; The moon had risen.&nbsp; Black figures strolled about

<P>listlessly, pouring water on the glow, whence proceeded

<P>a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the moonlight, the

<P>beaten nigger groaned somewhere.&nbsp; 'What a row the

<P>brute makes!' said the indefatigable man with the mus-

<P>taches, appearing near us.&nbsp; 'Serve him right.&nbsp; Trans-

<P>gression--punishment--bang!&nbsp; Pitiless, pitiless.&nbsp; That's

<P>the only way.&nbsp; This will prevent all conflagrations for

<P>the future.&nbsp; I was just telling the manager . . .'&nbsp; He

<P>noticed my companion, and became crestfallen all at once.

<P>'Not in bed yet,' he said, with a kind of servile hearti-

<P>ness; 'it's so natural.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Danger-agitation.'&nbsp; He

<P>vanished.&nbsp; I went on to the river-side, and the other fol-

<P>lowed me.&nbsp; I heard a scathing murmur at my ear, 'Heap

<P>of muffs--go to.'&nbsp; The pilgrims could be seen in knots

<P>gesticulating, discussing.&nbsp; Several had still their staves

<P>in their hands.&nbsp; I verily believe they took these sticks to

<P>bed with them.&nbsp; Beyond the fence the forest stood up

<P>spectrally in the moonlight, and through the dim stir,

<P>through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard,

<P>the silence of the land went home to one's very heart,--

<P>its mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its con-

<P>cealed life.&nbsp; The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere

<P>near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me

<P>mend my pace away from there.&nbsp; I felt a hand intro-

<P>ducing itself under my arm.&nbsp; 'My dear sir,' said the

<P>fellow, 'I don't want to be misunderstood, and especially

<P>by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before I can have

<P>that pleasure.&nbsp; I wouldn't like him to get a false idea

<P>of my disposition. . . .'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I let him run on, this papier-mache Mephistopheles,

<P>and it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my fore-

<P>finger through him, and would find nothing inside but

<P>a little loose dirt, maybe.&nbsp; He, don't you see, had been

<P>planning to be assistant-manager by-and-by under the

<P>present man, and I could see that the coming of that

<P>Kurtz had upset them both not a little.&nbsp; He talked pre-

<P>cipitately, and I did not try to stop him.&nbsp; I had my

<P>shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on

<P>the slope like a carcass of some big river animal.&nbsp; The

<P>smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my

<P>nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was before

<P>my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek.

<P>The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of

<P>silver--over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the

<P>wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall

<P>of a temple, over the great river I could see through a

<P>somber gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly

<P>by without a murmur.&nbsp; All this was great, expectant,

<P>mute, while the man jabbered about himself.&nbsp; I won-

<P>dered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity

<P>looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a

<P>menace.&nbsp; What were we who had strayed in here?&nbsp; Could

<P>we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?&nbsp; I

<P>felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that

<P>couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well.&nbsp; What was

<P>in there?&nbsp; I could see a little ivory coming out from

<P>there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there.&nbsp; I had

<P>heard enough about it too--God knows!&nbsp; Yet somehow

<P>it didn't bring any image with it--no more than if I

<P>had been told an angel or a fiend was in there.&nbsp; I be-

<P>lieved it in the same way one of you might believe there

<P>are inhabitants in the planet Mars.&nbsp; I knew once a Scotch

<P>sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people

<P>in Mars.&nbsp; If you asked him for some idea how they

<P>looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter some-

<P>thing about 'walking on all-fours.'&nbsp; If you as much

<P>as smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to

<P>fight you.&nbsp; I would not have gone so far as to fight

<P>for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie.&nbsp; You

<P>know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because

<P>I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because

<P>it appalls me.&nbsp; There is a taint of death, a flavor of

<P>mortality in lies,--which is exactly what I hate and

<P>detest in the world--what I want to forget.&nbsp; It makes

<P>me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would

<P>do.&nbsp; Temperament, I suppose.&nbsp; Well, I went near enough

<P>to it by letting the young fool there believe anything

<P>he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe.&nbsp; I

<P>became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest

<P>of the bewitched pilgrims.&nbsp; This simply because I had

<P>a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom

<P>at the time I did not see--you understand.&nbsp; He was just

<P>a word for me.&nbsp; I did not see the man in the name any

<P>more than you do.&nbsp; Do you see him?&nbsp; Do you

<P>see the story?&nbsp; Do you see anything?&nbsp; It seems to me

<P>I am trying to tell you a dream--making a vain at-

<P>tempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the

<P>dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, sur-

<P>prise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt,

<P>that notion of being captured by the incredible which is

<P>of the very essence of dreams. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was silent for a while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>". . .&nbsp; No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey

<P>the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence,

<P>--that which makes its truth, its meaning--its subtle and

<P>penetrating essence.&nbsp; It is impossible.&nbsp; We live, as we

<P>dream--alone. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused again as if reflecting, then added--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course in this you fellows see more than I could

<P>then.&nbsp; You see me, whom you know. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could

<P>hardly see one another.&nbsp; For a long time already he,

<P>sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice.&nbsp; There

<P>was not a word from anybody.&nbsp; The others might have

<P>been asleep, but I was awake.&nbsp; I listened, I listened on

<P>the watch for the sentence, for the word, that would give

<P>me the clew to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narra-

<P>tive that seemed to shape itself without human lips in

<P>the heavy night-air of the river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>". . .&nbsp; Yes--I let him run on," Marlow began again,

<P>"and think what he pleased about the powers that were

<P>behind me.&nbsp; I did!&nbsp; And there was nothing behind me!

<P>There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled

<P>steamboat I was leaning against, while he talked fluently

<P>about 'the necessity for every man to get on.'&nbsp; 'And

<P>when one comes out here, you conceive, it is not to gaze

<P>at the moon.'&nbsp; Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but

<P>even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate

<P>tools--intelligent men.'&nbsp; He did not make bricks--why,

<P>there was a physical impossibility in the way--as I was

<P>well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the man-

<P>ager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly

<P>the confidence of his superiors.'&nbsp; Did I see it?&nbsp; I saw it.

<P>What more did I want?&nbsp; What I really wanted was

<P>rivets, by heaven!&nbsp; Rivets.&nbsp; To get on with the work--to

<P>stop the hole.&nbsp; Rivets I wanted.&nbsp; There were cases of

<P>them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split!

<P>You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that

<P>station yard on the hillside.&nbsp; Rivets had rolled into the

<P>grove of death.&nbsp; You could fill your pockets with rivets

<P>for the trouble of stooping down--and there wasn't one

<P>rivet to be found where it was wanted.&nbsp; We had plates

<P>that would do, but nothing to fasten them with.&nbsp; And

<P>every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on

<P>shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast.

<P>And several times a week a coast caravan came in with

<P>trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you

<P>shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a

<P>penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs.

<P>And no rivets.&nbsp; Three carriers could have brought all

<P>that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my

<P>unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last,

<P>for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither

<P>God nor devil, let alone any mere man.&nbsp; I said I could

<P>see that very well, but what I wanted was a certain

<P>quantity of rivets--and rivets were what really Mr.

<P>Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it.&nbsp; Now letters

<P>went to the coast every week. . . .&nbsp; 'My dear sir,' he

<P>cried, 'I write from dictation.'&nbsp; I demanded rivets.&nbsp; There

<P>was a way--for an intelligent man.&nbsp; He changed his

<P>manner; became very cold, and suddenly began to talk

<P>about a hippopotamus; wondered whether sleeping on

<P>board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and

<P>day) I wasn't disturbed.&nbsp; There was an old hippo that

<P>had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roam-

<P>ing at night over the station grounds.&nbsp; The pilgrims

<P>used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they

<P>could lay hands on at him.&nbsp; Some even had sat up o'

<P>nights for him.&nbsp; All this energy was wasted, though.

<P>'That animal has a charmed life,' he said; 'but you can

<P>say this only of brutes in this country.&nbsp; No man--you

<P>apprehend me?--no man here bears a charmed life.'&nbsp; He

<P>stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his deli-

<P>cate hooked nose set a little askew, and his mica eyes

<P>glittering without a wink, then, with a curt Good night,

<P>he strode off.&nbsp; I could see he was disturbed and consid-

<P>erably puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than

<P>I had been for days.&nbsp; It was a great comfort to turn

<P>from that chap to my influential friend, the battered,

<P>twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat.&nbsp; I clambered on

<P>board.&nbsp; She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley

<P>&amp; Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was

<P>nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape,

<P>but I had expended enough hard work on her to make

<P>me love her.&nbsp; No influential friend would have served

<P>me better.&nbsp; She had given me a chance to come out a bit

<P>--to find out what I could do.&nbsp; No, I don't like work.

<P>I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things

<P>that can be done.&nbsp; I don't like work--no man does

<P>--but I like what is in the work,--the chance to find

<P>yourself.&nbsp; Your own reality--for yourself, not for others

<P>--what no other man can ever know.&nbsp; They can only

<P>see the mere show, and never can tell what it really

<P>means.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on

<P>the deck, with his legs dangling over the mud.&nbsp; You see

<P>I rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in

<P>that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despised

<P>--on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose.

<P>This was the foreman--a boiler-maker by trade--a good

<P>worker.&nbsp; He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with

<P>big intense eyes.&nbsp; His aspect was worried, and his head

<P>was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in

<P>falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had pros-

<P>pered in the new locality, for his beard hung down to

<P>his waist.&nbsp; He was a widower with six young children

<P>(he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come

<P>out there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying.

<P>He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur.&nbsp; He would rave

<P>about pigeons.&nbsp; After work hours he used sometimes to

<P>come over from his hut for a talk about his children and

<P>his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud

<P>under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that

<P>beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for

<P>the purpose.&nbsp; It had loops to go over his ears.&nbsp; In the

<P>evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing

<P>that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading

<P>it solemnly on a bush to dry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I slapped him on the back and shouted 'We shall have

<P>rivets!'&nbsp; He scrambled to his feet exclaiming 'No!

<P>Rivets!' as though he couldn't believe his ears.&nbsp; Then in

<P>a low voice, 'You . . . eh?'&nbsp; I don't know why we

<P>behaved like lunatics.&nbsp; I put my finger to the side of

<P>my nose and nodded mysteriously.&nbsp; 'Good for you!' he

<P>cried, snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one

<P>foot.&nbsp; I tried a jig.&nbsp; We capered on the iron deck.&nbsp;
A

<P>frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin

<P>forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a

<P>thundering roll upon the sleeping station.&nbsp; It must have

<P>made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels.&nbsp; A

<P>dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the man-

<P>ager's hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the

<P>doorway itself vanished too.&nbsp; We stopped, and the silence

<P>driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back

<P>again from the recesses of the land.&nbsp; The great wall of

<P>vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks,

<P>branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the

<P>moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life,

<P>a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to

<P>topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us

<P>out of his little existence.&nbsp; And it moved not.&nbsp; A dead-

<P>ened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us

<P>from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking

<P>a bath of glitter in the great river.&nbsp; 'After all,' said the

<P>boiler-maker in a reasonable tone, 'why shouldn't we get

<P>the rivets?'&nbsp; Why not, indeed!&nbsp; I did not know of any

<P>reason why we shouldn't.&nbsp; 'They'll come in three weeks,'

<P>I said confidently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But they didn't.&nbsp; Instead of rivets there came an

<P>invasion, an infliction, a visitation.&nbsp; It came in sections

<P>during the next three weeks, each section headed by a

<P>donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan

<P>shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the

<P>impressed pilgrims.&nbsp; A quarrelsome band of footsore

<P>sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkeys; a lot of

<P>tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales

<P>would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of

<P>mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the

<P>station.&nbsp; Five such installments came, with their absurd

<P>air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable out-

<P>fit shops and provision stores, that, one would think, they

<P>were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for equit-

<P>able division.&nbsp; It was an inextricable mess of things

<P>decent in themselves but that human folly made look

<P>like the spoils of thieving.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"this devoted band called itself the Eldorado Ex-

<P>ploring Expedition, and I believe they were sworn to

<P>secrecy.&nbsp; Their talk, however, was the talk of sordid

<P>buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy

<P>without audacity, and cruel without courage; there was

<P>not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the

<P>whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these

<P>things are wanted for the work of the world.&nbsp; To tear

<P>treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire,

<P>with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there

<P>is in burglars breaking into a safe.&nbsp; Who paid the ex-

<P>penses of the noble enterprise I don't know; but the

<P>uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.

<P>"In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neigh-

<P>borhood, and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning.&nbsp; He

<P>carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs,

<P>and during the time his gang infested the station spoke

<P>to no one but his nephew.&nbsp; You could see these two roam-

<P>ing about all day long with their heads close together

<P>in an everlasting confab.

<P>"I had given up worrying myself about the rivets.

<P>One's capacity for that kind of folly is more limited

<P>than you would suppose.&nbsp; I said Hang!--and let things

<P>slide.&nbsp; I had plenty of time for meditation, and now

<P>and then I would give some thought to Kurtz.&nbsp; I wasn't

<P>very interested in him.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Still, I was curious to see

<P>whether this man, who had come out equipped with moral

<P>ideas of some sort, would climb to the top after all, and

<P>how he would set about his work when there."
