<P>"I looked at him, lost in astonishment.&nbsp; There he

<P>was before me, in motley, as though he had absconded

<P>from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous.&nbsp; His

<P>very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and alto-

<P>gether bewildering.&nbsp; He was an insoluble problem.&nbsp; It

<P>was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had suc-

<P>ceeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remain

<P>--why he did not instantly disappear.&nbsp; 'I went a little

<P>farther,' he said, 'then still a little farther--till I had

<P>gone so far that I don't know how I'll ever get back.

<P>Never mind.&nbsp; Plenty time.&nbsp; I can manage.&nbsp; You take

<P>Kurtz away quick--quick--I tell you.'&nbsp; The glamour of

<P>youth enveloped his particolored rags, his destitution, his

<P>loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile wander-

<P>ings.&nbsp; For months--for years--his life hadn't been

<P>worth a day's purchase; and there he was gallantly,

<P>thoughtlessly alive, to all appearance indestructible solely

<P>by the virtue of his few years and of his unreflecting

<P>audacity.&nbsp; I was seduced into something like admiration

<P>--like envy.&nbsp; Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him

<P>unscathed.&nbsp; He surely wanted nothing from the wilder-

<P>ness but space to breathe in and to push on through.

<P>His need was to exist, and to move onwards at the great-

<P>est possible risk, and with a maximum of privation.&nbsp; If

<P>the absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of

<P>adventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this

<P>be-patched youth.&nbsp; I almost envied him the possession

<P>of this modest and clear flame.&nbsp; It seemed to have con-

<P>sumed all thought of self so completely, that, even while

<P>he was talking to you, you forgot that it was he--the

<P>man before your eyes--who had gone through these

<P>things.&nbsp; I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz,

<P>though.&nbsp; He had not meditated over it.&nbsp; It came to him,

<P>and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism.&nbsp; I must

<P>say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous

<P>thing in every way he had come upon so far.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They had come together unavoidably, like two ships

<P>becalmed near each other, and lay rubbing sides at last.

<P>I suppose Kurtz wanted an audience, because on a cer-

<P>tain occasion, when encamped in the forest, they had

<P>talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked.

<P>'We talked of everything,' he said, quite transported

<P>at the recollection.&nbsp; 'I forgot there was such a thing

<P>as sleep.&nbsp; The night did not seem to last an hour.&nbsp; Every-

<P>thing!&nbsp; Everything! . . .&nbsp; Of love too.'&nbsp; 'Ah, he

<P>talked to you of love!' I said, much amused.&nbsp; 'It isn't

<P>what you think,' he cried, almost passionately.&nbsp; 'It was

<P>in general.&nbsp; He made me see things--things.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He threw his arms up.&nbsp; We were on deck at the time,

<P>and the headman of my wood-cutters, lounging near by,

<P>turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes.&nbsp; I looked

<P>around, and I don't know why, but I assure you that

<P>never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle,

<P>the very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hope-

<P>less and so dark, so impenetrable to human thought, so

<P>pitiless to human weakness.&nbsp; 'And, ever since, you have

<P>been with him, of course?' I said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On the contrary.&nbsp; It appears their intercourse had

<P>been very much broken by various causes.&nbsp; He had, as

<P>he informed me proudly, managed to nurse Kurtz

<P>through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to

<P>some risky feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone,

<P>far in the depths of the forest.&nbsp; 'Very often coming to

<P>this station, I had to wait days and days before he would

<P>turn up,' he said.&nbsp; 'Ah, it was worth waiting for!--

<P>sometimes.'&nbsp; 'What was he doing? exploring or what?'

<P>I asked.&nbsp; 'Oh yes, of course;' he had discovered lots of

<P>villages, a lake too--he did not know exactly in what

<P>direction; it was dangerous to inquire too much--but

<P>mostly his expeditions had been for ivory.&nbsp; 'But he had

<P>no goods to trade with by that time,' I objected.&nbsp; 'There's

<P>a good lot of cartridges left even yet,' he answered, look-

<P>ing away.&nbsp; 'To speak plainly, he raided the country,'

<P>I said.&nbsp; He nodded.&nbsp; 'Not alone, surely!'&nbsp; He muttered

<P>something about the villages round that lake.&nbsp; 'Kurtz

<P>got the tribe to follow him, did he?' I suggested.&nbsp; He

<P>fidgeted a little.&nbsp; 'They adored him,' he said.&nbsp; The tone

<P>of these words was so extraordinary that I looked at

<P>him searchingly.&nbsp; It was curious to see his mingled eager-

<P>ness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz.&nbsp; The man filled

<P>his life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions.

<P>'What can you expect?' he burst out; 'he came to them

<P>with thunder and lightning, you know--and they had

<P>never seen anything like it--and very terrible.&nbsp; He could

<P>be very terrible.&nbsp; You can't judge Mr. Kurtz as you

<P>would an ordinary man.&nbsp; No, no, no!&nbsp; Now--just to

<P>give you an idea--I don't mind telling you, he wanted

<P>to shoot me too one day--but I don't judge him.'

<P>'Shoot you!' I cried.&nbsp; 'What for?'&nbsp; 'Well, I had a

<P>small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house

<P>gave me.&nbsp; You see I used to shoot game for them.&nbsp; Well,

<P>he wanted it, and wouldn't hear reason.&nbsp; He declared

<P>he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then

<P>cleared out of the country, because he could do so, and

<P>had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth to

<P>prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased.&nbsp; And it

<P>was true too.&nbsp; I gave him the ivory.&nbsp; What did I care!

<P>But I didn't clear out.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; I couldn't leave him.

<P>I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again

<P>for a time.&nbsp; He had his second illness then.&nbsp; Afterwards

<P>I had to keep out of the way; but I didn't mind.&nbsp; He

<P>was living for the most part in those villages on the

<P>lake.&nbsp; When he came down to the river, sometimes he

<P>would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me

<P>to be careful.&nbsp; This man suffered too much.&nbsp; He hated

<P>all this, and somehow he couldn't get away.&nbsp; When I had

<P>a chance I begged him to try and leave while there was

<P>time; I offered to go back with him.&nbsp; And he would

<P>say yes, and then he would remain; go off on another

<P>ivory hunt; disappear for weeks; forget himself amongst

<P>these people--forget himself--you know.'&nbsp; 'Why! he's

<P>mad,' I said.&nbsp; He protested indignantly.&nbsp; Mr. Kurtz

<P>couldn't be mad.&nbsp; If I had heard him talk, only two

<P>days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at such a thing. . . .

<P>I had taken up my binoculars while we talked and

<P>was looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the

<P>forest at each side and at the back of the house.&nbsp; The

<P>consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent,

<P>so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the

<P>hill--made me uneasy.&nbsp; There was no sign on the face

<P>of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much

<P>told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations, com-

<P>pleted by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in hints ending

<P>in deep sighs.&nbsp; The woods were unmoved, like a mask--

<P>heavy, like the closed door of a prison--they looked with

<P>their air of hidden knowledge, of patient expectation,

<P>of unapproachable silence.&nbsp; The Russian was explaining

<P>to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had come

<P>down to the river, bringing along with him all the fight-

<P>ing men of that lake tribe.&nbsp; He had been absent for

<P>several months--getting himself adored, I suppose--and

<P>had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to all

<P>appearance of making a raid either across the river or

<P>down stream.&nbsp; Evidently the appetite for more ivory

<P>had got the better of the--what shall I say?--less ma-

<P>terial aspirations.&nbsp; However he had got much worse

<P>suddenly.&nbsp; 'I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came

<P>up--took my chance,' said the Russian.&nbsp; 'Oh, he is

<P>bad, very bad.'&nbsp; I directed my glass to the house.&nbsp; There

<P>were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof,

<P>the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three

<P>little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all

<P>this brought within reach of my hand, as it were.&nbsp; And

<P>then I made a brusque movement, and one of the remain-

<P>ing posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field

<P>of my glass.&nbsp; You remember I told you I had been

<P>struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamenta-

<P>tion, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place.

<P>Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its first result

<P>was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow.

<P>Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass,

<P>and I saw my mistake.&nbsp; These round knobs were not

<P>ornamental but symbolic; they were expressive and

<P>puzzling, striking and disturbing--food for thought and

<P>also for the vultures if there had been any looking down

<P>from the sky; but at all events for such ants as were

<P>industrious enough to ascend the pole.&nbsp; They would

<P>have been even more impressive, those heads on the

<P>stakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house.

<P>Only one, the first I had made out, was facing my way.

<P>I was not so shocked as you may think.&nbsp; The start back

<P>I had given was really nothing but a movement of sur-

<P>prise.&nbsp; I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you

<P>know.&nbsp; I returned deliberately to the first I had seen--

<P>and there it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eye-

<P>lids,--a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole,

<P>and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white

<P>line of the teeth, was smiling too, smiling continuously

<P>at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am not disclosing any trade secrets.&nbsp; In fact the

<P>manager said afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's methods had

<P>ruined the district.&nbsp; I have no opinion on that point,

<P>but I want you clearly to understand that there was

<P>nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there.

<P>They only showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the

<P>gratification of his various lusts, that there was some-

<P>thing wanting in him--some small matter which, when

<P>the pressing need arose, could not be found under his

<P>magnificent eloquence.&nbsp; Whether he knew of this de-

<P>ficiency himself I can't say.&nbsp; I think the knowledge came

<P>to him at last--only at the very last.&nbsp; But the wilder-

<P>ness had found him out early, and had taken on him

<P>a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion.&nbsp; I think

<P>it had whispered to him things about himself which he

<P>did not know, things of which he had no conception till

<P>he took counsel with this great solitude--and the whisper

<P>had proved irresistibly fascinating.&nbsp; It echoed loudly

<P>within him because he was hollow at the core. . . .&nbsp; I

<P>put down the glass, and the head that had appeared

<P>near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have

<P>leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen.&nbsp; In

<P>a hurried, indistinct voice he began to assure me he had

<P>not dared to take these--say, symbols--down.&nbsp; He was

<P>not afraid of the natives; they would not stir till Mr.

<P>Kurtz gave the word.&nbsp; His ascendency was extraor-

<P>dinary.&nbsp; The camps of these people surrounded the

<P>place, and the chiefs came every day to see him.&nbsp; They

<P>would crawl. . . .&nbsp; 'I don't want to know anything of

<P>the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,' I

<P>shouted.&nbsp; Curious, this feeling that came over me that

<P>such details would be more intolerable than those heads

<P>drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz's windows.&nbsp; After

<P>all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at one

<P>bound to have been transported into some lightless

<P>region of subtle horrors, where pure, uncomplicated

<P>savagery was a positive relief, being something that had

<P>a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine.&nbsp; The

<P>young man looked at me with surprise.&nbsp; I suppose it

<P>did not occur to him Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine.

<P>He forgot I hadn't heard any of these splendid mono-

<P>logues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct of life

<P>--or what not.&nbsp; If it had come to crawling before Mr.

<P>Kurtz, he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them

<P>all.&nbsp; I had no idea of the conditions, he said: these heads

<P>were the heads of rebels.&nbsp; I shocked him excessively by

<P>laughing.&nbsp; Rebels!&nbsp; What would be the next definition

<P>I was to hear?&nbsp; There had been enemies, criminals, work-

<P>ers--and these were rebels.&nbsp; Those rebellious heads looked

<P>very subdued to me on their sticks.&nbsp; 'You don't know how

<P>such a life tries a man like Kurtz,' cried Kurtz's last

<P>disciple.&nbsp; 'Well, and you?' I said.&nbsp; 'I!&nbsp; I!&nbsp; I
am a

<P>simple man.&nbsp; I have no great thoughts.&nbsp; I want nothing

<P>from anybody.&nbsp; How can you compare me to . . .?"

<P>His feelings were too much for speech, and suddenly he

<P>broke down.&nbsp; 'I don't understand,' he groaned.&nbsp; 'I've

<P>been doing my best to keep him alive, and that's enough.

<P>I had no hand in all this.&nbsp; I have no abilities.&nbsp; There

<P>hasn't been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid

<P>food for months here.&nbsp; He was shamefully abandoned.

<P>A man like this, with such ideas.&nbsp; Shamefully!

<P>Shamefully!&nbsp; I--I--haven't slept for the last ten

<P>nights. . . .'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"His voice lost itself in the calm of the evening.&nbsp; The

<P>long shadows of the forest had slipped down hill while

<P>we talked, had gone far beyond the ruined hovel, be-

<P>yond the symbolic row of stakes.&nbsp; All this was in the

<P>gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine,

<P>and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing

<P>glittered in a still and dazzling splendor, with a murky

<P>and over-shadowed bend above and below.&nbsp; Not a living

<P>soul was seen on the shore.&nbsp; The bushes did not rustle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of

<P>men appeared, as though they had come up from the

<P>ground.&nbsp; They waded waist-deep in the grass, in a

<P>compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their

<P>midst.&nbsp; Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a

<P>cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp

<P>arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land; and,

<P>as if by enchantment, streams of human beings--of

<P>naked human beings--with spears in their hands, with

<P>bows, with shields, with wild glances and savage move-

<P>ments, were poured into the clearing by the dark-faced

<P>and pensive forest.&nbsp; The bushes shook, the grass swayed

<P>for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive

<P>immobility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we

<P>are all done for,' said the Russian at my elbow.&nbsp; The

<P>knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too, half-way

<P>to the steamer, as if petrified.&nbsp; I saw the man on the

<P>stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above

<P>the shoulders of the bearers.&nbsp; 'Let us hope that the

<P>man who can talk so well of love in general will find

<P>some particular reason to spare us this time,' I said.&nbsp; I

<P>resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as

<P>if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had

<P>been a dishonoring necessity.&nbsp; I could not hear a sound,

<P>but through my glasses I saw the thin arm extended

<P>commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of that

<P>apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that

<P>nodded with grotesque jerks.&nbsp; Kurtz--Kurtz--that

<P>means short in German--don't it?&nbsp; Well, the name was

<P>as true as everything else in his life--and death.&nbsp; He

<P>looked at least seven feet long.&nbsp; His covering had fallen

<P>off, and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling

<P>as from a winding-sheet.&nbsp; I could see the cage of his

<P>ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.&nbsp; It was as

<P>though an animated image of death carved out of old

<P>ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a

<P>motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering

<P>bronze.&nbsp; I saw him open his mouth wide--it gave him

<P>a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to

<P>swallow all the air, all the earth, all the men before him.

<P>A deep voice reached me faintly.&nbsp; He must have been

<P>shouting.&nbsp; He fell back suddenly.&nbsp; The stretcher shook

<P>as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at

<P>the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was

<P>vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat,

<P>as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly

<P>had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a

<P>long aspiration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his

<P>arms--two shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-

<P>carbine--the thunderbolts of that pitiful Jupiter.&nbsp; The

<P>manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside

<P>his head.&nbsp; They laid him down in one of the little cabins

<P>--just a room for a bed-place and a camp-stool or two,

<P>you know.&nbsp; We had brought his belated correspondence,

<P>and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his

<P>bed.&nbsp; His hand roamed feebly amongst these papers.&nbsp; I

<P>was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed

<P>languor of his expression.&nbsp; It was not so much the ex-

<P>haustion of disease.&nbsp; He did not seem in pain.&nbsp; This

<P>shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for the

<P>moment it had had its fill of all the emotions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He rustled one of the letters, and looking straight

<P>in my face said, 'I am glad.'&nbsp; Somebody had been writ-

<P>ing to him about me.&nbsp; These special recommendations

<P>were turning up again.&nbsp; The volume of tone he emitted

<P>without effort, almost without the trouble of moving his

<P>lips, amazed me.&nbsp; A voice! a voice!&nbsp; It was grave, pro-

<P>found, vibrating, while the man did not seem capable

<P>of a whisper.&nbsp; However, he had enough strength in

<P>him--factitious no doubt--to very nearly make an end

<P>of us, as you shall hear directly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The manager appeared silently in the doorway; I

<P>stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me.

<P>The Russian, eyed curiously by the pilgrims, was star-

<P>ing at the shore.&nbsp; I followed the direction of his glance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dark human shapes could be made out in the distance,

<P>flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the

<P>forest, and near the river two bronze figures, leaning

<P>on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under fantastic head-

<P>dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque

<P>repose.&nbsp; And from right to left along the lighted shore

<P>moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She walked with measured steps, draped in striped

<P>and fringed cloths, treading the earth proudly, with a

<P>slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments.&nbsp; She

<P>carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape

<P>of a helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass

<P>wire gauntlets to the elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny

<P>cheek, innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck;

<P>bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men, that hung

<P>about her, glittered and trembled at every step.&nbsp; She

<P>must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon

<P>her.&nbsp; She was savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnifi-

<P>cent; there was something ominous and stately in her

<P>deliberate progress.&nbsp; And in the hush that had fallen

<P>suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense

<P>wilderness, the colossal body of the fecund and mys-

<P>terious life seemed to look at her, pensive, as though it

<P>had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and

<P>passionate soul.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced

<P>us.&nbsp; Her long shadow fell to the water's edge.&nbsp; Her face

<P>had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of

<P>dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling,

<P>half-shaped resolve.&nbsp; She stood looking at us without

<P>a stir and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brood-

<P>ing over an inscrutable purpose.&nbsp; A whole minute passed,

<P>and then she made a step forward.&nbsp; There was a low

<P>jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of fringed draper-

<P>ies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her.&nbsp; The

<P>young fellow by my side growled.&nbsp; The pilgrims mur-

<P>mured at my back.&nbsp; She looked at us all as if her life

<P>had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her

<P>glance.&nbsp; Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw

<P>them up rigid above her head, as though in an uncon-

<P>trollable desire to touch the sky, and at the same time

<P>the swift shadows darted out on the earth, swept around

<P>on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy em-

<P>brace.&nbsp; A formidable silence hung over the scene.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She turned away slowly, walked on, following the

<P>bank, and passed into the bushes to the left.&nbsp; Once only

<P>her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets

<P>before she disappeared.

<P>"'If she had offered to come aboard I really think I

<P>would have tried to shoot her,' said the man of patches,

<P>nervously.&nbsp; 'I had been risking my life every day for

<P>the last fortnight to keep her out of the house.&nbsp; She

<P>got in one day and kicked up a row about those miser-

<P>able rags I picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes

<P>with.&nbsp; I wasn't decent.&nbsp; At least it must have been that,

<P>for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour, point-

<P>ing at me now and then.&nbsp; I don't understand the dia-

<P>lect of this tribe.&nbsp; Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt

<P>too ill that day to care, or there would have been mis-

<P>chief.&nbsp; I don't understand. . . .&nbsp; No--it's too much

<P>for me.&nbsp; Ah, well, it's all over now.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At this moment I heard Kurtz's deep voice behind

<P>the curtain, 'Save me!--save the ivory, you mean.&nbsp; Don't

<P>tell me.&nbsp; Save ME!&nbsp; Why, I've had to save you.&nbsp; You

<P>are interrupting my plans now.&nbsp; Sick!&nbsp; Sick!&nbsp; Not so

<P>sick as you would like to believe.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; I'll

<P>carry my ideas out yet--I will return.&nbsp; I'll show you

<P>what can be done.&nbsp; You with your little peddling no-

<P>tions--you are interfering with me.&nbsp; I will return.

<P>I . . .'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The manager came out.&nbsp; He did me the honor to

<P>take me under the arm and lead me aside.&nbsp; 'He is very

<P>low, very low,' he said.&nbsp; He considered it necessary to

<P>sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful.&nbsp; 'We

<P>have done all we could for him--haven't we?&nbsp; But there

<P>is no disguising the fact, Mr. Kurtz has done more

<P>harm than good to the Company.&nbsp; He did not see the

<P>time was not ripe for vigorous action.&nbsp; Cautiously, cau-

<P>tiously--that's my principle.&nbsp; We must be cautious yet.

<P>The district is closed to us for a time.&nbsp; Deplorable!&nbsp; Upon

<P>the whole, the trade will suffer.&nbsp; I don't deny there is

<P>a remarkable quantity of ivory--mostly fossil.&nbsp; We must

<P>save it, at all events--but look how precarious the posi-

<P>tion is--and why?&nbsp; Because the method is unsound.'

<P>'Do you,' said I, looking at the shore, 'call it "unsound

<P>method"?'&nbsp; 'Without doubt,' he exclaimed, hotly.

<P>'Don't you?' . . .&nbsp; 'No method at all,' I murmured

<P>after a while.&nbsp; 'Exactly,' he exulted.&nbsp; 'I anticipated

<P>this.&nbsp; Shows a complete want of judgment.&nbsp; It is my

<P>duty to point it out in the proper quarter.'&nbsp; 'Oh,' said

<P>I, 'that fellow--what's his name?--the brickmaker, will

<P>make a readable report for you.'&nbsp; He appeared con-

<P>founded for a moment.&nbsp; It seemed to me I had never

<P>breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned mentally

<P>to Kurtz for relief--positively for relief.&nbsp; 'Neverthe-

<P>less I think Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man,' I said with

<P>emphasis.&nbsp; He started, dropped on me a cold heavy

<P>glance, said very quietly, 'He WAS,' and turned his back

<P>on me.&nbsp; My hour of favor was over; I found myself

<P>lumped along with Kurtz as a partisan of methods for

<P>which the time was not ripe: I was unsound!&nbsp; Ah! but it

<P>was something to have at least a choice of nightmares.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr.

<P>Kurtz, who, I was ready to admit, was as good as buried.

<P>And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were

<P>buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets.&nbsp; I

<P>felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the

<P>smell of the damp earth, the unseen presence of victorious

<P>corruption, the darkness of an impenetrable night. . . .

<P>The Russian tapped me on the shoulder.&nbsp; I heard him

<P>mumbling and stammering something about 'brother

<P>seaman--couldn't conceal--knowledge of matters that

<P>would affect Mr. Kurtz's reputation.'&nbsp; I waited.&nbsp; For

<P>him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave; I suspect

<P>that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals.

<P>'Well!' said I at last, 'speak out.&nbsp; As it happens, I am

<P>Mr. Kurtz's friend--in a way.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He stated with a good deal of formality that had

<P>we not been 'of the same profession,' he would have

<P>kept the matter to himself without regard to conse-

<P>quences.&nbsp; 'He suspected there was an active ill-will to-

<P>wards him on the part of these white men that--'

<P>'You are right,' I said, remembering a certain conversa-

<P>tion I had overheard.&nbsp; 'The manager thinks you ought

<P>to be hanged.'&nbsp; He showed a concern at this intelligence

<P>which amused me at first.&nbsp; 'I had better get out of the

<P>way quietly,' he said, earnestly.&nbsp; 'I can do no more for

<P>Kurtz now, and they would soon find some excuse.

<P>What's to stop them?&nbsp; There's a military post three hun-

<P>dred miles from here.'&nbsp; 'Well, upon my word,' said I,

<P>'perhaps you had better go if you have any friends

<P>amongst the savages near by.'&nbsp; 'Plenty,' he said.&nbsp; 'They

<P>are simple people--and I want nothing, you know.'

<P>He stood biting his lips, then: 'I don't want any harm to

<P>happen to these whites here, but of course I was think-

<P>ing of Mr. Kurtz's reputation--but you are a brother

<P>seaman and--'&nbsp; 'All right,' said I, after a time.

<P>'Mr. Kurtz's reputation is safe with me.'&nbsp; I did not

<P>know how truly I spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He informed me, lowering his voice, that it was

<P>Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the

<P>steamer.&nbsp; 'He hated sometimes the idea of being taken

<P>away--and then again. . . .&nbsp; But I don't understand

<P>these matters.&nbsp; I am a simple man.&nbsp; He thought it would

<P>scare you away--that you would give it up, thinking

<P>him dead.&nbsp; I could not stop him.&nbsp; Oh, I had an awful

<P>time of it this last month.'&nbsp; 'Very well,' I said.&nbsp; 'He is

<P>all right now.'&nbsp; 'Ye-e-es,' he muttered, not very con-

<P>vinced apparently.&nbsp; 'Thanks,' said I; 'I shall keep my

<P>eyes open.'&nbsp; 'But quiet--eh?' he urged, anxiously.&nbsp; 'It

<P>would be awful for his reputation if anybody here--'

<P>I promised a complete discretion with great gravity.&nbsp; 'I

<P>have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very

<P>far.&nbsp; I am off.&nbsp; Could you give me a few Martini-Henry

<P>cartridges?'&nbsp; I could, and did, with proper secrecy.&nbsp; He

<P>helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my

<P>tobacco.&nbsp; 'Between sailors--you know--good English

<P>tobacco.'&nbsp; At the door of the pilot-house he turned round

<P>--'I say, haven't you a pair of shoes you could spare?'

<P>He raised one leg.&nbsp; 'Look.'&nbsp; The soles were tied with

<P>knotted strings sandal-wise under his bare feet.&nbsp; I rooted

<P>out an old pair, at which he looked with admiration be-

<P>fore tucking it under his left arm.&nbsp; One of his pockets

<P>(bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the

<P>other (dark blue) peeped 'Towson's Inquiry,' &amp;c., &amp;c.

<P>He seemed to think himself excellently well equipped

<P>for a renewed encounter with the wilderness.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; I'll

<P>never, never meet such a man again.&nbsp; You ought to

<P>have heard him recite poetry--his own too it was, he told

<P>me.&nbsp; Poetry!'&nbsp; He rolled his eyes at the recollection

<P>of these delights.&nbsp; 'Oh, he enlarged my mind!'&nbsp; 'Good-

<P>by,' said I.&nbsp; He shook hands and vanished in the night.

<P>Sometimes I ask myself whether I had ever really seen

<P>him--whether it was possible to meet such a phenome-

<P>non! . . .
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning

<P>came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed,

<P>in the starred darkness, real enough to make me get

<P>up for the purpose of having a look round.&nbsp; On the

<P>hill a big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked

<P>corner of the station-house.&nbsp; One of the agents with

<P>a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose,

<P>was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within the

<P>forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and

<P>rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes

<P>of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the

<P>camp where Mr. Kurtz's adorers were keeping their un-

<P>easy vigil.&nbsp; The monotonous beating of a big drum filled

<P>the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration.&nbsp; A

<P>steady droning sound of many men chanting each to

<P>himself some weird incantation came out from the black,

<P>flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes

<P>out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon

<P>my half-awake senses.&nbsp; I believe I dozed off leaning

<P>over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an over-

<P>whelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy,

<P>woke me up in a bewildered wonder.&nbsp; It was cut short

<P>all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect

<P>of audible and soothing silence.&nbsp; I glanced casually into

<P>the little cabin.&nbsp; A light was burning within, but Mr.

<P>Kurtz was not there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think I would have raised an outcry if I had be-

<P>lieved my eyes.&nbsp; But I didn't believe them at first--the

<P>thing seemed so impossible.&nbsp; The fact is I was completely

<P>unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract terror,

<P>unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger.

<P>What made this emotion so overpowering was--how shall

<P>I define it?--the moral shock I received, as if something

<P>altogether monstrous, intolerable to thought and odious

<P>to the soul, had been thrust upon me unexpectedly.&nbsp; This

<P>lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and

<P>then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the

<P>possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre, or some-

<P>thing of the kind, which I saw impending, was positively

<P>welcome and composing.&nbsp; It pacified me, in fact, so

<P>much, that I did not raise an alarm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster

<P>and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of

<P>e.&nbsp; The yells had not awakened him; he snored very

<P>slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore.

<P>I did not betray Mr. Kurtz--it was ordered I should

<P>never betray him--it was written I should be loyal to

<P>the nightmare of my choice.&nbsp; I was anxious to deal

<P>with this shadow by myself alone,--and to this day I

<P>don't know why I was so jealous of sharing with any-

<P>one the peculiar blackness of that experience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail--a broad

<P>trail through the grass.&nbsp; I remember the exultation with

<P>which I said to myself, 'He can't walk--he is crawling

<P>on all-fours--I've got him.'&nbsp; The grass was wet with

<P>dew.&nbsp; I strode rapidly with clenched fists.&nbsp; I fancy I

<P>had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving

<P>him a drubbing.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I had some imbecile

<P>thoughts.&nbsp; The knitting old woman with the cat ob-

<P>truded herself upon my memory as a most improper

<P>person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair.

<P>I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out

<P>of Winchesters held to the hip.&nbsp; I thought I would

<P>never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself

<P>living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced

<P>age.&nbsp; Such silly things--you know.&nbsp; And I remember

<P>I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of

<P>my heart, and was pleased at its calm regularity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kept to the track though--then stopped to listen.

<P>The night was very clear: a dark blue space, sparkling

<P>with dew and starlight, in which black things stood

<P>very still.&nbsp; I thought I could see a kind of motion ahead

<P>of me.&nbsp; I was strangely cocksure of everything that

<P>night.&nbsp; I actually left the track and ran in a wide semi-

<P>circle (I verily believe chuckling to myself) so as to

<P>get in front of that stir, of that motion I had seen--

<P>if indeed I had seen anything.&nbsp; I was circumventing

<P>Kurtz as though it had been a boyish game.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming,

<P>I would have fallen over him too, but he got up in

<P>time.&nbsp; He rose, unsteady, long, pale, indistinct, like a

<P>vapor exhaled by the earth, and swayed slightly, misty

<P>and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed

<P>between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued

<P>from the forest.&nbsp; I had cut him off cleverly; but when

<P>actually confronting him I seemed to come to my senses,

<P>I saw the danger in its right proportion.&nbsp; It was by

<P>no means over yet.&nbsp; Suppose he began to shout?&nbsp; Though

<P>he could hardly stand, there was still plenty of vigor

<P>in his voice.&nbsp; 'Go away--hide yourself,' he said, in that

<P>profound tone.&nbsp; It was very awful.&nbsp; I glanced back.

<P>We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire.&nbsp; A

<P>black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving

<P>long black arms, across the glow.&nbsp; It had horns--ante-

<P>lope horns, I think--on its head.&nbsp; Some sorcerer, some

<P>witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiend-like enough.&nbsp; 'Do

<P>you know what you are doing?' I whispered.&nbsp; 'Per-

<P>fectly,' he answered, raising his voice for that single

<P>word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail

<P>through a speaking-trumpet.&nbsp; If he makes a row we

<P>are lost, I thought to myself.&nbsp; This clearly was not a

<P>case for fisticuffs, even apart from the very natural

<P>aversion I had to beat that Shadow--this wandering and

<P>tormented thing.&nbsp; 'You will be lost,' I said--'utterly

<P>lost.'&nbsp; One gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration,

<P>you know.&nbsp; I did say the right thing, though indeed

<P>he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he

<P>was at this very moment, when the foundations of our

<P>intimacy were being laid--to endure--to endure--even

<P>to the end--even beyond.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'I had immense plans,' he muttered irresolutely.

<P>'Yes,' said I; 'but if you try to shout I'll smash your

<P>head with--' there was not a stick or a stone near.&nbsp; 'I

<P>will throttle you for good,' I corrected myself.&nbsp; 'I was

<P>on the threshold of great things,' he pleaded, in a voice

<P>of longing, with a wistfulness of tone that made my

<P>blood run cold.&nbsp; 'And now for this stupid scoundrel--'

<P>'Your success in Europe is assured in any case,' I af-

<P>firmed, steadily.&nbsp; I did not want to have the throttling

<P>of him, you understand--and indeed it would have been

<P>very little use for any practical purpose.&nbsp; I tried to

<P>break the spell--the heavy, mute spell of the wilder-

<P>ness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by

<P>the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the

<P>memory of gratified and monstrous passions.&nbsp; This alone,

<P>I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the

<P>forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb

<P>of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone

<P>had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of

<P>permitted aspirations.&nbsp; And, don't you see, the terror

<P>of the position was not in being knocked on the head

<P>--though I had a very lively sense of that danger too

<P>--but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom

<P>I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low.

<P>I had, even like the niggers, to invoke him--himself--

<P>his own exalted and incredible degradation.&nbsp; There was

<P>nothing either above or below him, and I knew it.&nbsp; He

<P>had kicked himself loose of the earth.&nbsp; Confound the

<P>man! he had kicked the very earth to pieces.&nbsp; He was

<P>alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood

<P>on the ground or floated in the air.&nbsp; I've been telling

<P>you what we said--repeating the phrases we pronounced,

<P>--but what's the good?&nbsp; They were common everyday

<P>words,--the familiar, vague sounds exchanged on every

<P>waking day of life.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; They had be-

<P>hind them, to my mind, the terrific suggestiveness of

<P>words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in night-

<P>mares.&nbsp; Soul!&nbsp; If anybody had ever struggled with a

<P>soul, I am the man.&nbsp; And I wasn't arguing with a luna-

<P>tic either.&nbsp; Believe me or not, his intelligence was per-

<P>fectly clear--concentrated, it is true, upon himself with

<P>horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only

<P>chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and

<P>then, which wasn't so good, on account of unavoidable

<P>noise.&nbsp; But his soul was mad.&nbsp; Being alone in the wilder-

<P>ness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I tell

<P>you, it had gone mad.&nbsp; I had--for my sins, I suppose--

<P>to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself.&nbsp; No

<P>eloquence could have been so withering to one's belief

<P>in mankind as his final burst of sincerity.&nbsp; He struggled

<P>with himself, too.&nbsp; I saw it,--I heard it.&nbsp; I saw the in-

<P>conceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no

<P>faith, and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself.&nbsp; I

<P>kept my head pretty well; but when I had him at last

<P>stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my

<P>legs shook under me as though I had carried half a

<P>ton on my back down that hill.&nbsp; And yet I had only

<P>supported him, his bony arm clasped round my neck

<P>--and he was not much heavier than a child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose

<P>presence behind the curtain of trees I had been acutely

<P>conscious all the time, flowed out of the woods again,

<P>filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass of naked,

<P>breathing, quivering, bronze bodies.&nbsp; I steamed up a

<P>bit, then swung down-stream, and two thousand eyes

<P>followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping,

<P>fierce river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail

<P>and breathing black smoke into the air.&nbsp; In front of

<P>the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with

<P>bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro

<P>restlessly.&nbsp; When we came abreast again, they faced the

<P>river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned heads,

<P>swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce

<P>river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin

<P>with a pendent tail--something that looked like a dried

<P>gourd; they shouted periodically together strings of

<P>amazing words that resembled no sounds of human lan-

<P>guage; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, inter-

<P>rupted suddenly, were like the response of some satanic

<P>litany.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was

<P>more air there.&nbsp; Lying on the couch, he stared through

<P>the open shutter.&nbsp; There was an eddy in the mass of

<P>human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and

<P>tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream.

<P>She put out her hands, shouted something, and all that

<P>wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of

<P>articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Do you understand this?' I asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing

<P>eyes, with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate.

<P>He made no answer, but I saw a smile, a smile of inde-

<P>finable meaning, appear on his colorless lips that a mo-

<P>ment after twitched convulsively.&nbsp; 'Do I not?' he said

<P>slowly, gasping, as if the words had been torn out of

<P>him by a supernatural power.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this

<P>because I saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their

<P>rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark.&nbsp; At the

<P>sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror

<P>through that wedged mass of bodies.&nbsp; 'Don't! don't!

<P>you frighten them away,' cried someone on deck dis-

<P>consolately.&nbsp; I pulled the string time after time.&nbsp; They

<P>broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they swerved,

<P>they dodged the flying terror of the sound.&nbsp; The three

<P>red chaps had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as

<P>though they had been shot dead.&nbsp; Only the barbarous

<P>and superb woman did not so much as flinch, and

<P>stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the

<P>somber and glittering river.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then that imbecile crowd down on the deck

<P>started their little fun, and I could see nothing more

<P>for smoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of

<P>darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice

<P>the speed of our upward progress; and Kurtz's life was

<P>running swiftly too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart

<P>into the sea of inexorable time.&nbsp; The manager was very

<P>placid, he had no vital anxieties now, he took us both

<P>in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance: the 'affair'

<P>had come off as well as could be wished.&nbsp; I saw the time

<P>approaching when I would be left alone of the party of

<P>'unsound method.'&nbsp; The pilgrims looked upon me with

<P>disfavor.&nbsp; I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead.

<P>It is strange how I accepted this unforeseen partner-

<P>ship, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the

<P>tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phan-

<P>toms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Kurtz discoursed.&nbsp; A voice! a voice!&nbsp; It rang deep

<P>to the very last.&nbsp; It survived his strength to hide in

<P>the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness

<P>of his heart.&nbsp; Oh, he struggled! he struggled!&nbsp; The

<P>wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy

<P>images now--images of wealth and fame revolving

<P>obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble

<P>and lofty expression.&nbsp; My Intended, my station, my

<P>career, my ideas--these were the subjects for the occa-

<P>sional utterances of elevated sentiments.&nbsp; The shade of

<P>the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow

<P>sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the

<P>mold of primeval earth.&nbsp; But both the diabolic love and

<P>the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated

<P>fought for the possession of that soul satiated with

<P>primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham dis-

<P>tinction, of all the appearances of success and power.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sometimes he was contemptibly childish.&nbsp; He desired

<P>to have kings meet him at railway-stations on his return

<P>from some ghastly Nowhere, where he intended to ac-

<P>complish great things.&nbsp; 'You show them you have in

<P>you something that is really profitable, and then there

<P>will be no limits to the recognition of your ability,' he

<P>would say.&nbsp; 'Of course you must take care of the mo-

<P>tives--right motives--always.'&nbsp; The long reaches that

<P>were like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that

<P>were exactly alike, slipped past the steamer with their

<P>multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this

<P>grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner of

<P>change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings.

<P>I looked ahead--piloting.&nbsp; 'Close the shutter,' said

<P>Kurtz suddenly one day; 'I can't bear to look at this.'

<P>I did so.&nbsp; There was a silence.&nbsp; 'Oh, but I will wring

<P>your heart yet!' he cried at the invisible wilderness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We broke down--as I had expected--and had to lie

<P>up for repairs at the head of an island.&nbsp; This delay

<P>was the first thing that shook Kurtz's confidence.&nbsp; One

<P>morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photo-

<P>graph,--the lot tied together with a shoe-string.&nbsp; 'Keep

<P>this for me,' he said.&nbsp; 'This noxious fool' (meaning

<P>the manager) 'is capable of prying into my boxes when

<P>I am not looking.'&nbsp; In the afternoon I saw him.&nbsp; He

<P>was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew

<P>quietly, but I heard him mutter, 'Live rightly, die,

<P>die . . .'&nbsp; I listened.&nbsp; There was nothing more.&nbsp; Was

<P>he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a frag-

<P>ment of a phrase from some newspaper article?&nbsp; He had

<P>been writing for the papers and meant to do so again,

<P>'for the furthering of my ideas.&nbsp; It's a duty.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"His was an impenetrable darkness.&nbsp; I looked at him

<P>as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom

<P>of a precipice where the sun never shines.&nbsp; But I had

<P>not much time to give him, because I was helping the

<P>engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to

<P>straighten a bent connecting-rod, and in other such

<P>matters.&nbsp; I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings,

<P>nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers, ratchet-drills--things I

<P>abominate, because I don't get on with them.&nbsp; I tended

<P>the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled

<P>wearily in a wretched scrap-heap--unless I had the

<P>shakes too bad to stand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One evening coming in with a candle I was startled

<P>to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here

<P>in the dark waiting for death.'&nbsp; The light was within

<P>a foot of his eyes.&nbsp; I forced myself to murmur, 'Oh,

<P>nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anything approaching the change that came over

<P>his features I have never seen before, and hope never

<P>to see again.&nbsp; Oh, I wasn't touched.&nbsp; I was fascinated.

<P>It was as though a veil had been rent.&nbsp; I saw on that

<P>ivory face the expression of somber pride, of ruthless

<P>power, of craven terror--of an intense and hopeless

<P>despair.&nbsp; Did he live his life again in every detail of

<P>desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme

<P>moment of complete knowledge?&nbsp; He cried in a whisper

<P>at some image, at some vision,--he cried out twice, a

<P>cry that was no more than a breath--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'The horror!&nbsp; The horror!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I blew the candle out and left the cabin.&nbsp; The pil-

<P>grims were dining in the mess-room, and I took my

<P>place opposite the manager, who lifted his eyes to give

<P>me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored.

<P>He leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his

<P>sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness.&nbsp; A con-

<P>tinuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp,

<P>upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.&nbsp; Suddenly

<P>the manager's boy put his insolent black head in the

<P>doorway, and said in a tone of scathing contempt--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Mistah Kurtz--he dead.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All the pilgrims rushed out to see.&nbsp; I remained, and

<P>went on with my dinner.&nbsp; I believe I was considered

<P>brutally callous.&nbsp; However, I did not eat much.&nbsp; There

<P>was a lamp in there--light, don't you know--and outside

<P>it was so beastly, beastly dark.&nbsp; I went no more near

<P>the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment

<P>upon the adventures of his soul on this earth.&nbsp; The

<P>voice was gone.&nbsp; What else had been there?&nbsp; But I am

<P>of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried some-

<P>thing in a muddy hole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then they very nearly buried me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz

<P>there and then.&nbsp; I did not.&nbsp; I remained to dream the

<P>nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to

<P>Kurtz once more.&nbsp; Destiny.&nbsp; My destiny!&nbsp; Droll thing

<P>life is--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic

<P>for a futile purpose.&nbsp; The most you can hope from it

<P>is some knowledge of yourself--that comes too late--a

<P>crop of unextinguishable regrets.&nbsp; I have wrestled with

<P>death.&nbsp; It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine.

<P>It takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing

<P>underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators,

<P>without clamor, without glory, without the great desire

<P>of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly

<P>atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in

<P>your own right, and still less in that of your adversary.

<P>If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a

<P>greater riddle than some of us think it to be.&nbsp; I was

<P>within a hair's-breadth of the last opportunity for pro-

<P>nouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably

<P>I would have nothing to say.&nbsp; This is the reason why I

<P>affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man.&nbsp; He had some-

<P>thing to say.&nbsp; He said it.&nbsp; Since I had peeped over the

<P>edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his

<P>stare, that could not see the flame of the candle, but was

<P>wide enough to embrace the whole universe, piercing

<P>enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the dark-

<P>ness.&nbsp; He had summed up--he had judged.&nbsp; 'The

<P>horror!'&nbsp; He was a remarkable man.&nbsp; After all, this

<P>was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candor,

<P>it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its

<P>whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth

<P>--the strange commingling of desire and hate.&nbsp; And it

<P>is not my own extremity I remember best--a vision of

<P>grayness without form filled with physical pain, and a

<P>careless contempt for the evanescence of all things--even

<P>of this pain itself.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It is his extremity that I seem

<P>to have lived through.&nbsp; True, he had made that last

<P>stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I had been

<P>permitted to draw back my hesitating foot.&nbsp; And per-

<P>haps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wis-

<P>dom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed

<P>into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step

<P>over the threshold of the invisible.&nbsp; Perhaps!&nbsp; I like to

<P>think my summing-up would not have been a word of

<P>careless contempt.&nbsp; Better his cry--much better.&nbsp; It was

<P>an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable

<P>defeats, by abominable terrors, by abominable satisfac-

<P>tions.&nbsp; But it was a victory!&nbsp; That is why I have re-

<P>mained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond,

<P>when a long time after I heard once more, not his own

<P>voice, but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown

<P>to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of

<P>crystal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, they did not bury me, though there is a period

<P>of time which I remember mistily, with a shuddering

<P>wonder, like a passage through some inconceivable world

<P>that had no hope in it and no desire.&nbsp; I found myself

<P>back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people

<P>hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from

<P>each other, to devour their infamous cookery, to gulp

<P>their unwholesome beer, to dream their insignificant and

<P>silly dreams.&nbsp; They trespassed upon my thoughts.&nbsp; They

<P>were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an

<P>irritating pretense, because I felt so sure they could

<P>not possibly know the things I knew.&nbsp; Their bearing,

<P>which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals

<P>going about their business in the assurance of perfect

<P>safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flaunt-

<P>ings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to

<P>comprehend.&nbsp; I had no particular desire to enlighten

<P>them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself

<P>from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid impor-

<P>tance.&nbsp; I dare say I was not very well at that time.&nbsp; I

<P>tottered about the streets--there were various affairs to

<P>settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable per-

<P>sons.&nbsp; I admit my behavior was inexcusable, but then my

<P>temperature was seldom normal in these days.&nbsp; My dear

<P>aunt's endeavors to 'nurse up my strength' seemed alto-

<P>gether beside the mark.&nbsp; It was not my strength that

<P>wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted

<P>soothing.&nbsp; I kept the bundle of papers given me by

<P>Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do with it.&nbsp; His

<P>mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by

<P>his Intended.&nbsp; A clean-shaved man, with an official

<P>manner and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, called on

<P>me one day and made inquiries, at first circuitous, after-

<P>wards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased to

<P>denominate certain 'documents.'&nbsp; I was not surprised,

<P>because I had had two rows with the manager on the

<P>subject out there.&nbsp; I had refused to give up the smallest

<P>scrap out of that package, and I took the same attitude

<P>with the spectacled man.&nbsp; He became darkly menacing

<P>at last, and with much heat argued that the Company

<P>had the right to every bit of information about its 'ter-

<P>ritories.'&nbsp; And, said he, 'Mr. Kurtz's knowledge of

<P>unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive

<P>and peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the

<P>deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed:

<P>therefore'--I assured him Mr. Kurtz's knowledge,

<P>however extensive, did not bear upon the problems of

<P>commerce or administration.&nbsp; He invoked then the name

<P>of science.&nbsp; 'It would be an incalculable loss if,' &amp;c., &amp;c.

<P>I offered him the report on the 'Suppression of Savage

<P>Customs,' with the postscriptum torn off.&nbsp; He took it

<P>up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air of

<P>contempt.&nbsp; 'This is not what we had a right to expect,'

<P>he remarked.&nbsp; 'Expect nothing else,' I said.&nbsp; 'There

<P>are only private letters.'&nbsp; He withdrew upon some threat

<P>of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more; but an-

<P>other fellow, calling himself Kurtz's cousin, appeared

<P>two days later, and was anxious to hear all the details

<P>about his dear relative's last moments.&nbsp; Incidentally he

<P>gave me to understand that Kurtz had been essentially

<P>a great musician.&nbsp; 'There was the making of an im-

<P>mense success,' said the man, who was an organist, I

<P>believe, with lank gray hair flowing over a greasy coat-

<P>collar.&nbsp; I had no reason to doubt his statement; and to

<P>this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz's pro-

<P>fession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest

<P>of his talents.&nbsp; I had taken him for a painter who wrote

<P>for the papers, or else for a journalist who could paint

<P>--but even the cousin (who took snuff during the inter-

<P>view) could not tell me what he had been--exactly.&nbsp; He

<P>was a universal genius--on that point I agreed with the

<P>old chap, who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a

<P>large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agita-

<P>tion, bearing off some family letters and memoranda

<P>without importance.&nbsp; Ultimately a journalist anxious to

<P>know something of the fate of his 'dear colleague'

<P>turned up.&nbsp; This visitor informed me Kurtz's proper

<P>sphere ought to have been politics 'on the popular side.'

<P>He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped

<P>short, an eye-glass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming

<P>expansive, confessed his opinion that Kurtz really

<P>couldn't write a bit--'but heavens! how that man could

<P>talk!&nbsp; He electrified large meetings.&nbsp; He had faith--

<P>don't you see?--he had the faith.&nbsp; He could get himself

<P>to believe anything--anything.&nbsp; He would have been

<P>a splendid leader of an extreme party.'&nbsp; 'What party?'

<P>I asked.&nbsp; 'Any party,' answered the other.&nbsp; 'He was

<P>an--an--extremist.'&nbsp; Did I not think so?&nbsp; I assented.

<P>Did I know, he asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity,

<P>'what it was that had induced him to go out there?'

<P>'Yes,' said I, and forthwith handed him the famous

<P>Report for publication, if he thought fit.&nbsp; He glanced

<P>through it hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged 'it

<P>would do,' and took himself off with this plunder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters

<P>and the girl's portrait.&nbsp; She struck me as beautiful--

<P>I mean she had a beautiful expression.&nbsp; I know that the

<P>sunlight can be made to lie too, yet one felt that no

<P>manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the

<P>delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features.&nbsp; She

<P>seemed ready to listen without mental reservation, with-

<P>out suspicion, without a thought for herself.&nbsp; I con-

<P>cluded I would go and give her back her portrait and

<P>those letters myself.&nbsp; Curiosity?&nbsp; Yes; and also some

<P>other feeling perhaps.&nbsp; All that had been Kurtz's had

<P>passed out of my hands: his soul, his body, his station,

<P>his plans, his ivory, his career.&nbsp; There remained only

<P>his memory and his Intended--and I wanted to give that

<P>up too to the past, in a way,--to surrender personally

<P>all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which

<P>is the last word of our common fate.&nbsp; I don't defend

<P>myself.&nbsp; I had no clear perception of what it was I

<P>really wanted.&nbsp; Perhaps it was an impulse of uncon-

<P>scious loyalty, or the fulfillment of one of these ironic

<P>necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence.

<P>I don't know.&nbsp; I can't tell.&nbsp; But I went.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought his memory was like the other memories

<P>of the dead that accumulate in every man's life,--a vague

<P>impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it

<P>in their swift and final passage; but before the high and

<P>ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as

<P>still and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I

<P>had a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth

<P>voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its

<P>mankind.&nbsp; He lived then before me; he lived as much

<P>as he had ever lived--a shadow insatiable of splendid

<P>appearances, of frightful realities; a shadow darker than

<P>the shadow of the night, and draped nobly in the folds

<P>of a gorgeous eloquence.&nbsp; The vision seemed to enter

<P>the house with me--the stretcher, the phantom-bearers,

<P>the wild crowd of obedient worshipers, the gloom of the

<P>forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky bends,

<P>the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beat-

<P>ing of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness.&nbsp; It

<P>was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invad-

<P>ing and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would

<P>have to keep back alone for the salvation of another

<P>soul.&nbsp; And the memory of what I had heard him say

<P>afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back,

<P>in the glow of fires, within the patient woods, those

<P>broken phrases came back to me, were heard again in

<P>their ominous and terrifying simplicity.&nbsp; I remembered

<P>his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale

<P>of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tem-

<P>pestuous anguish of his soul.&nbsp; And later on I seemed to

<P>see his collected languid manner, when he said one day,

<P>'This lot of ivory now is really mine.&nbsp; The Company

<P>did not pay for it.&nbsp; I collected it myself at a very great

<P>personal risk.&nbsp; I am afraid they will try to claim it as

<P>theirs though.&nbsp; H'm.&nbsp; It is a difficult case.&nbsp; What do

<P>you think I ought to do--resist?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; I want no more

<P>than justice.' . . .&nbsp; He wanted no more than justice--

<P>no more than justice.&nbsp; I rang the bell before a mahogany

<P>door on the first floor, and while I waited he seemed to

<P>stare at me out of the glassy panel--stare with that wide

<P>and immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all

<P>the universe.&nbsp; I seemed to hear the whispered cry, 'The

<P>horror!&nbsp; The horror!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The dusk was falling.&nbsp; I had to wait in a lofty draw-

<P>ing-room with three long windows from floor to ceiling

<P>that were like three luminous and bedraped columns.

<P>The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in

<P>indistinct curves.&nbsp; The tall marble fireplace had a cold

<P>and monumental whiteness.&nbsp; A grand piano stood mas-

<P>sively in a corner, with dark gleams on the flat sur-

<P>faces like a somber and polished sarcophagus.&nbsp; A high

<P>door opened--closed.&nbsp; I rose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She came forward, all in black, with a pale head,

<P>floating towards me in the dusk.&nbsp; She was in mourning.

<P>It was more than a year since his death, more than a

<P>year since the news came; she seemed as though she

<P>would remember and mourn for ever.&nbsp; She took both

<P>my hands in hers and murmured, 'I had heard you

<P>were coming.'&nbsp; I noticed she was not very young--I

<P>mean not girlish.&nbsp; She had a mature capacity for fidelity,

<P>for belief, for suffering.&nbsp; The room seemed to have

<P>grown darker, as if all the sad light of the cloudy

<P>evening had taken refuge on her forehead.&nbsp; This fair

<P>hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded

<P>by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at

<P>me.&nbsp; Their glance was guileless, profound, confident, and

<P>trustful.&nbsp; She carried her sorrowful head as though she

<P>were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say, I

<P>--I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.

<P>But while we were still shaking hands, such a look of

<P>awful desolation came upon her face that I perceived she

<P>was one of those creatures that are not the playthings

<P>of Time.&nbsp; For her he had died only yesterday.&nbsp; And,

<P>by Jove! the impression was so powerful that for me too

<P>he seemed to have died only yesterday--nay, this very

<P>minute.&nbsp; I saw her and him in the same instant of time

<P>--his death and her sorrow--I saw her sorrow in the

<P>very moment of his death.&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; I saw

<P>them together--I heard them together.&nbsp; She had said,

<P>with a deep catch of the breath, 'I have survived;' while

<P>my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled with

<P>her tone of despairing regret, the summing-up whisper

<P>of his eternal condemnation.&nbsp; I asked myself what I

<P>was doing there, with a sensation of panic in my heart

<P>as though I had blundered into a place of cruel and

<P>absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold.

<P>She motioned me to a chair.&nbsp; We sat down.&nbsp; I laid the

<P>packet gently on the little table, and she put her hand

<P>over it. . . .&nbsp; 'You knew him well,' she murmured,

<P>after a moment of mourning silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Intimacy grows quick out there,' I said.&nbsp; 'I knew

<P>him as well as it is possible for one man to know another.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'And you admired him,' she said.&nbsp; 'It was impossible

<P>to know him and not to admire him.&nbsp; Was it?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'He was a remarkable man,' I said, unsteadily.&nbsp; Then

<P>before the appealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to

<P>watch for more words on my lips, I went on, 'It was

<P>impossible not to--'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Love him,' she finished eagerly, silencing me into

<P>an appalled dumbness.&nbsp; 'How true! how true!&nbsp; But

<P>when you think that no one knew him so well as I!&nbsp; I

<P>had all his noble confidence.&nbsp; I knew him best.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'You knew him best,' I repeated.&nbsp; And perhaps she

<P>did.&nbsp; But with every word spoken the room was growing

<P>darker, and only her forehead, smooth and white, re-

<P>mained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief

<P>and love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'You were his friend,' she went on.&nbsp; 'His friend,'

<P>she repeated, a little louder.&nbsp; 'You must have been, if

<P>he had given you this, and sent you to me.&nbsp; I feel I

<P>can speak to you--and oh! I must speak.&nbsp; I want you

<P>--you who have heard his last words--to know I have

<P>been worthy of him. . . .&nbsp; It is not pride. . . .&nbsp; Yes!

<P>I am proud to know I understood him better than any-

<P>one on earth--he told me so himself.&nbsp; And since his

<P>mother died I have had no one--no one--to--to--'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I listened.&nbsp; The darkness deepened.&nbsp; I was not even

<P>sure whether he had given me the right bundle.&nbsp; I rather

<P>suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of

<P>his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager

<P>examining under the lamp.&nbsp; And the girl talked, easing

<P>her pain in the certitude of my sympathy; she talked as

<P>thirsty men drink.&nbsp; I had heard that her engagement

<P>with Kurtz had been disapproved by her people.&nbsp; He

<P>wasn't rich enough or something.&nbsp; And indeed I don't

<P>know whether he had not been a pauper all his life.&nbsp; He

<P>had given me some reason to infer that it was his im-

<P>patience of comparative poverty that drove him out

<P>there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'. . .&nbsp; Who was not his friend who had heard him

<P>speak once?' she was saying.&nbsp; 'He drew men towards

<P>him by what was best in them.'&nbsp; She looked at me with

<P>intensity.&nbsp; 'It is the gift of the great,' she went on,

<P>and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the ac-

<P>companiment of all the other sounds, full of mystery,

<P>desolation, and sorrow, I had ever heard--the ripple of

<P>the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind,

<P>the murmurs of wild crowds, the faint ring of incom-

<P>prehensible words cried from afar, the whisper of a

<P>voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal

<P>darkness.&nbsp; 'But you have heard him!&nbsp; You know!' she

<P>cried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Yes, I know,' I said with something like despair

<P>in my heart, but bowing my head before the faith that

<P>was in her, before that great and saving illusion that

<P>shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in the

<P>triumphant darkness from which I could not have de-

<P>fended her--from which I could not even defend

<P>myself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'What a loss to me--to us!'--she corrected herself

<P>with beautiful generosity; then added in a murmur, 'To

<P>the world.'&nbsp; By the last gleams of twilight I could see

<P>the glitter of her eyes, full of tears--of tears that would

<P>not fall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'I have been very happy--very fortunate--very

<P>proud,' she went on.&nbsp; 'Too fortunate.&nbsp; Too happy for

<P>a little while.&nbsp; And now I am unhappy for--for

<P>life.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the

<P>remaining light in a glimmer of gold.&nbsp; I rose too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'And of all this,' she went on, mournfully, 'of all his

<P>promise, and of all his greatness, of his generous mind,

<P>of his noble heart, nothing remains--nothing but a

<P>memory.&nbsp; You and I--'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'We shall always remember him,' I said, hastily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'No!' she cried.&nbsp; 'It is impossible that all this should

<P>be lost--that such a life should be sacrificed to leave

<P>nothing--but sorrow.&nbsp; You know what vast plans he

<P>had.&nbsp; I knew of them too--I could not perhaps under-

<P>stand,--but others knew of them.&nbsp; Something must re-

<P>main.&nbsp; His words, at least, have not died.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'His words will remain,' I said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'And his example,' she whispered to herself.&nbsp; 'Men

<P>looked up to him,--his goodness shone in every act.&nbsp; His

<P>example--'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'True,' I said; 'his example too.&nbsp; Yes, his example.

<P>I forgot that.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'But I do not.&nbsp; I cannot--I cannot believe--not yet.

<P>I cannot believe that I shall never see him again, that

<P>nobody will see him again, never, never, never.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She put out her arms as if after a retreating figure,

<P>stretching them black and with clasped pale hands across

<P>the fading and narrow sheen of the window.&nbsp; Never see

<P>him!&nbsp; I saw him clearly enough then.&nbsp; I shall see this

<P>eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her

<P>too, a tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this ges-

<P>ture another one, tragic also, and bedecked with power-

<P>less charms, stretching bare brown arms over the glitter

<P>of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness.&nbsp; She said

<P>suddenly very low, 'He died as he lived.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'His end,' said I, with dull anger stirring in me,

<P>'was in every way worthy of his life.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'And I was not with him,' she murmured.&nbsp; My anger

<P>subsided before a feeling of infinite pity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Everything that could be done--' I mumbled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Ah, but I believed in him more than anyone on

<P>earth--more than his own mother, more than--himself.

<P>He needed me!&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; I would have treasured every sigh,

<P>every word, every sign, every glance.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I felt like a chill grip on my chest.&nbsp; 'Don't,' I said,

<P>in a muffled voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Forgive me.&nbsp; I--I--have mourned so long in silence

<P>--in silence. . . .&nbsp; You were with him--to the last?

<P>I think of his loneliness.&nbsp; Nobody near to understand

<P>him as I would have understood.&nbsp; Perhaps no one to

<P>hear. . . .'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'To the very end,' I said, shakily.&nbsp; 'I heard his very

<P>last words. . . .'&nbsp; I stopped in a fright.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Repeat them,' she said in a heart-broken tone.&nbsp; 'I

<P>want--I want--something--something--to--to live

<P>with.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was on the point of crying at her, 'Don't you hear

<P>them?'&nbsp; The dusk was repeating them in a persistent

<P>whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed to swell

<P>menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind.&nbsp; 'The

<P>horror! the horror!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'His last word--to live with,' she murmured.&nbsp; 'Don't

<P>you understand I loved him--I loved him--I loved him!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'The last word he pronounced was--your name.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I heard a light sigh, and then my heart stood still,

<P>stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry, by

<P>the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable

<P>pain.&nbsp; 'I knew it--I was sure!' . . .&nbsp; She knew.&nbsp; She

<P>was sure.&nbsp; I heard her weeping; she had hidden her

<P>face in her hands.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the house would

<P>collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would

<P>fall upon my head.&nbsp; But nothing happened.&nbsp; The

<P>heavens do not fall for such a trifle.&nbsp; Would they have

<P>fallen, I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice

<P>which was his due?&nbsp; Hadn't he said he wanted only jus-

<P>tice?&nbsp; But I couldn't.&nbsp; I could not tell her.&nbsp; It would

<P>have been too dark--too dark altogether. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in

<P>the pose of a meditating Buddha.&nbsp; Nobody moved for a

<P>time.&nbsp; "We have lost the first of the ebb," said the Di-

<P>rector, suddenly.&nbsp; I raised my head.&nbsp; The offing was

<P>barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil water-

<P>way leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed

<P>somber under an overcast sky--seemed to lead into the

<P>heart of an immense darkness.
