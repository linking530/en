<P>THIS could have occurred nowhere but in England,

<P>where men and sea interpenetrate, so to speak--the sea

<P>entering into the life of most men, and the men know-

<P>ing something or everything about the sea, in the way

<P>of amusement, of travel, or of bread-winning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We were sitting round a mahogany table that reflected

<P>the bottle, the claret-glasses, and our faces as we leaned

<P>on our elbows.&nbsp; There was a director of companies, an

<P>accountant, a lawyer, Marlow, and myself.&nbsp; The direc-

<P>tor had been a CONWAY boy, the accountant had served

<P>four years at sea, the lawyer--a fine crusted Tory, High

<P>Churchman, the best of old fellows, the soul of honor--

<P>had been chief officer in the P. &amp; O. service in the good

<P>old days when mail-boats were square-rigged at least on

<P>two masts, and used to come down the China Sea before

<P>a fair monsoon with stun'-sails set alow and aloft.&nbsp; We

<P>all began life in the merchant service.&nbsp; Between the five

<P>of us there was the strong bond of the sea, and also the

<P>fellowship of the craft, which no amount of enthusiasm

<P>for yachting, cruising, and so on can give, since one is

<P>only the amusement of life and the other is life itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Marlow (at least I think that is how he spelt his name)

<P>told the story, or rather the chronicle, of a voyage:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I have seen a little of the Eastern seas; but what

<P>I remember best is my first voyage there.&nbsp; You fellows

<P>know there are those voyages that seem ordered for the

<P>illustration of life, that might stand for a symbol of

<P>existence.&nbsp; You fight, work, sweat, nearly kill yourself,

<P>sometimes do kill yourself, trying to accomplish some-

<P>thing--and you can't.&nbsp; Not from any fault of yours.

<P>You simply can do nothing, neither great nor little--

<P>not a thing in the world--not even marry an old maid, or

<P>get a wretched 600-ton cargo of coal to its port of desti-

<P>nation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was altogether a memorable affair.&nbsp; It was my

<P>first voyage to the East, and my first voyage as second

<P>mate; it was also my skipper's first command.&nbsp; You'll

<P>admit it was time.&nbsp; He was sixty if a day; a little man,

<P>with a broad, not very straight back, with bowed shoul-

<P>ders and one leg more bandy than the other, he had that

<P>queer twisted-about appearance you see so often in men

<P>who work in the fields.&nbsp; He had a nut-cracker face--chin

<P>and nose trying to come together over a sunken mouth--

<P>and it was framed in iron-gray fluffy hair, that looked

<P>like a chin strap of cotton-wool sprinkled with coal-dust.

<P>And he had blue eyes in that old face of his, which were

<P>amazingly like a boy's, with that candid expression some

<P>quite common men preserve to the end of their days by

<P>a rare internal gift of simplicity of heart and rectitude

<P>of soul.&nbsp; What induced him to accept me was a wonder.

<P>I had come out of a crack Australian clipper, where I

<P>had been third officer, and he seemed to have a prejudice

<P>against crack clippers as aristocratic and high-toned.

<P>He said to me, 'You know, in this ship you will have to

<P>work.'&nbsp; I said I had to work in every ship I had ever

<P>been in.&nbsp; 'Ah, but this is different, and you gentlemen

<P>out of them big ships; . . . but there!&nbsp; I dare say you

<P>will do.&nbsp; Join to-morrow.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I joined to-morrow.&nbsp; It was twenty-two years ago;

<P>and I was just twenty.&nbsp; How time passes!&nbsp; It was one

<P>of the happiest days of my life.&nbsp; Fancy!&nbsp; Second mate

<P>for the first time--a really responsible officer!&nbsp; I wouldn't

<P>have thrown up my new billet for a fortune.&nbsp; The mate

<P>looked me over carefully.&nbsp; He was also an old chap, but

<P>of another stamp.&nbsp; He had a Roman nose, a snow-white,

<P>long beard, and his name was Mahon, but he insisted that

<P>it should be pronounced Mann.&nbsp; He was well connected;

<P>yet there was something wrong with his luck, and he

<P>had never got on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As to the captain, he had been for years in coasters,

<P>then in the Mediterranean, and last in the West Indian

<P>trade.&nbsp; He had never been round the Capes.&nbsp; He could

<P>just write a kind of sketchy hand, and didn't care for

<P>writing at all.&nbsp; Both were thorough good seamen of

<P>course, and between those two old chaps I felt like a

<P>small boy between two grandfathers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The ship also was old.&nbsp; Her name was the Judea.

<P>Queer name, isn't it?&nbsp; She belonged to a man Wilmer,

<P>Wilcox--some name like that; but he has been bankrupt

<P>and dead these twenty years or more, and his name don't

<P>matter.&nbsp; She had been laid up in Shadwell basin for ever

<P>so long.&nbsp; You can imagine her state.&nbsp; She was all rust,

<P>dust, grime--soot aloft, dirt on deck.&nbsp; To me it was

<P>like coming out of a palace into a ruined cottage.&nbsp; She

<P>was about 400 tons, had a primitive windlass, wooden

<P>latches to the doors, not a bit of brass about her, and a

<P>big square stern.&nbsp; There was on it, below her name in

<P>big letters, a lot of scroll work, with the gilt off, and some

<P>sort of a coat of arms, with the motto 'Do or Die' under-

<P>neath.&nbsp; I remember it took my fancy immensely.&nbsp; There

<P>was a touch of romance in it, something that made me

<P>love the old thing--something that appealed to my

<P>youth!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We left London in ballast--sand ballast--to load a

<P>cargo of coal in a northern port for Bankok.&nbsp; Bankok!

<P>I thrilled.&nbsp; I had been six years at sea, but had only seen

<P>Melbourne and Sydney, very good places, charming

<P>places in their way--but Bankok!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We worked out of the Thames under canvas, with a

<P>North Sea pilot on board.&nbsp; His name was Jermyn, and

<P>he dodged all day long about the galley drying his hand-

<P>kerchief before the stove.&nbsp; Apparently he never slept.

<P>He was a dismal man, with a perpetual tear sparkling

<P>at the end of his nose, who either had been in trouble, or

<P>was in trouble, or expected to be in trouble--couldn't be

<P>happy unless something went wrong.&nbsp; He mistrusted

<P>my youth, my common-sense, and my seamanship, and

<P>made a point of showing it in a hundred little ways.&nbsp; I

<P>dare say he was right.&nbsp; It seems to me I knew very little

<P>then, and I know not much more now; but I cherish a

<P>hate for that Jermyn to this day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were a week working up as far as Yarmouth

<P>Roads, and then we got into a gale--the famous October

<P>gale of twenty-two years ago.&nbsp; It was wind, lightning,

<P>sleet, snow, and a terrific sea.&nbsp; We were flying light, and

<P>you may imagine how bad it was when I tell you we had

<P>smashed bulwarks and a flooded deck.&nbsp; On the second

<P>night she shifted her ballast into the lee bow, and by

<P>that time we had been blown off somewhere on the Dogger

<P>Bank.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but go below with

<P>shovels and try to right her, and there we were in that

<P>vast hold, gloomy like a cavern, the tallow dips stuck

<P>and flickering on the beams, the gale howling above, the

<P>ship tossing about like mad on her side; there we all

<P>were, Jermyn, the captain, everyone, hardly able to keep

<P>our feet, engaged on that gravedigger's work, and try-

<P>ing to toss shovelfuls of wet sand up to windward.&nbsp; At

<P>every tumble of the ship you could see vaguely in the

<P>dim light men falling down with a great flourish of shov-

<P>els.&nbsp; One of the ship's boys (we had two), impressed by

<P>the weirdness of the scene, wept as if his heart would

<P>break.&nbsp; We could hear him blubbering somewhere in the

<P>shadows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On the third day the gale died out, and by-and-by a

<P>north-country tug picked us up.&nbsp; We took sixteen days

<P>in all to get from London to the Tyne!&nbsp; When we got

<P>into dock we had lost our turn for loading, and they

<P>hauled us off to a tier where we remained for a month.

<P>Mrs. Beard (the captain's name was Beard) came from

<P>Colchester to see the old man.&nbsp; She lived on board.&nbsp; The

<P>crew of runners had left, and there remained only the

<P>officers, one boy, and the steward, a mulatto who an-

<P>swered to the name of Abraham.&nbsp; Mrs. Beard was an old

<P>woman, with a race all wrinkled and ruddy like a winter

<P>apple, and the figure of a young girl.&nbsp; She caught sight

<P>of me once, sewing on a button, and insisted on having

<P>my shirts to repair.&nbsp; This was something different from

<P>the captains' wives I had known on board crack clippers.

<P>When I brought her the shirts, she said: 'And the

<P>socks?&nbsp; They want mending, I am sure, and John's--

<P>Captain Beard's--things are all in order now.&nbsp; I would

<P>be glad of something to do.'&nbsp; Bless the old woman.&nbsp; She

<P>overhauled my outfit for me, and meantime I read for the

<P>first time 'Sartor Resartus' and Burnaby's 'Ride to

<P>Khiva.'&nbsp; I didn't understand much of the first then;

<P>but I remember I preferred the soldier to the philosopher

<P>at the time; a preference which life has only confirmed.

<P>One was a man, and the other was either more--or less.

<P>However, they are both dead, and Mrs. Beard is dead,

<P>and youth, strength, genius, thoughts, achievements,

<P>simple hearts--all die . . . .&nbsp; No matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They loaded us at last.&nbsp; We shipped a crew.&nbsp; Eight

<P>able seamen and two boys.&nbsp; We hauled off one evening

<P>to the buoys at the dock-gates, ready to go out, and with

<P>a fair prospect of beginning the voyage next day.&nbsp; Mrs.

<P>Beard was to start for home by a late train.&nbsp; When the

<P>ship was fast we went to tea.&nbsp; We sat rather silent

<P>through the meal--Mahon, the old couple, and I.&nbsp; I

<P>finished first, and slipped away for a smoke, my cabin

<P>being in a deck-house just against the poop.&nbsp; It was high

<P>water, blowing fresh with a drizzle; the double dock-

<P>gates were opened, and the steam colliers were going in

<P>and out in the darkness with their lights burning

<P>bright, a great plashing of propellers, rattling of

<P>winches, and a lot of hailing on the pier-heads.&nbsp; I watched

<P>the procession of head-lights gliding high and of green

<P>lights gliding low in the night, when suddenly a red

<P>gleam flashed at me, vanished, came into view again, and

<P>remained.&nbsp; The fore-end of a steamer loomed up close.

<P>I shouted down the cabin, 'Come up, quick!' and then

<P>heard a startled voice saying afar in the dark, 'Stop her,

<P>sir.'&nbsp; A bell jingled.&nbsp; Another voice cried warningly,

<P>'We are going right into that bark, sir.'&nbsp; The answer to

<P>this was a gruff 'All right,' and the next thing was a

<P>heavy crash as the steamer struck a glancing blow with

<P>the bluff of her bow about our fore-rigging.&nbsp; There was

<P>a moment of confusion, yelling, and running about.

<P>Steam roared.&nbsp; Then somebody was heard saying, 'All

<P>clear, sir.' . . . 'Are you all right?' asked the gruff

<P>voice.&nbsp; I had jumped forward to see the damage, and

<P>hailed back, 'I think so.'&nbsp; 'Easy astern,' said the gruff

<P>voice.&nbsp; A bell jingled.&nbsp; 'What steamer is that?'

<P>screamed Mahon.&nbsp; By that time she was no more to us

<P>than a bulky shadow maneuvering a little way off.&nbsp; They

<P>shouted at us some name--a woman's name, Miranda or

<P>Melissa--or some such thing.&nbsp; 'This means another

<P>month in this beastly hole,' said Mahon to me, as we

<P>peered with lamps about the splintered bulwarks and

<P>broken braces.&nbsp; 'But where's the captain?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had not heard or seen anything of him all that

<P>time.&nbsp; We went aft to look.&nbsp; A doleful voice arose hail-

<P>ing somewhere in the middle of the dock, 'Judea ahoy!'

<P>. . . How the devil did he get there? . . . 'Hallo!'

<P>we shouted.&nbsp; 'I am adrift in our boat without oars,' he

<P>cried.&nbsp; A belated waterman offered his services, and

<P>Mahon struck a bargain with him for half-a-crown to

<P>tow our skipper alongside; but it was Mrs. Beard that

<P>came up the ladder first.&nbsp; They had been floating about

<P>the dock in that mizzly cold rain for nearly an hour.&nbsp; I

<P>was never so surprised in my life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It appears that when he heard my shout 'Come up,'

<P>he understood at once what was the matter, caught up

<P>his wife, ran on deck, and across, and down into our boat,

<P>which was fast to the ladder.&nbsp; Not bad for a sixty-year-

<P>old.&nbsp; Just imagine that old fellow saving heroically in

<P>his arms that old woman--the woman of his life.&nbsp; He

<P>set her down on a thwart, and was ready to climb back

<P>on board when the painter came adrift somehow, and

<P>away they went together.&nbsp; Of course in the confusion

<P>we did not hear him shouting.&nbsp; He looked abashed.&nbsp; She

<P>said cheerfully, 'I suppose it does not matter my losing

<P>the train now?'&nbsp; 'No, Jenny--you go below and get

<P>warm,' he growled.&nbsp; Then to us: 'A sailor has no busi-

<P>ness with a wife--I say.&nbsp; There I was, out of the ship.

<P>Well, no harm done this time.&nbsp; Let's go and look at what

<P>that fool of a steamer smashed.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It wasn't much, but it delayed us three weeks.&nbsp; At

<P>the end of that time, the captain being engaged with his

<P>agents, I carried Mrs. Beard's bag to the railway-sta-

<P>tion and put her all comfy into a third-class carriage.

<P>She lowered the window to say, 'You are a good young

<P>man.&nbsp; If you see John--Captain Beard--without his

<P>muffler at night, just remind him from me to keep his

<P>throat well wrapped up.'&nbsp; 'Certainly, Mrs. Beard,' I

<P>said.&nbsp; 'You are a good young man; I noticed how at-

<P>tentive you are to John--to Captain--'&nbsp; The train

<P>pulled out suddenly; I took my cap off to the old

<P>woman: I never saw her again. . . .&nbsp; Pass the bottle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We went to sea next day.&nbsp; When we made that start

<P>for Bankok we had been already three months out of

<P>London.&nbsp; We had expected to be a fortnight or so--at

<P>the outside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was January, and the weather was beautiful--the

<P>beautiful sunny winter weather that has more charm

<P>than in the summer-time, because it is unexpected, and

<P>crisp, and you know it won't, it can't, last long.&nbsp; It's

<P>like a windfall, like a godsend, like an unexpected piece

<P>of luck.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It lasted all down the North Sea, all down Channel;

<P>and it lasted till we were three hundred miles or so to the

<P>westward of the Lizards: then the wind went round to

<P>the sou'west and began to pipe up.&nbsp; In two days it blew

<P>a gale.&nbsp; The Judea, hove to, wallowed on the Atlantic

<P>like an old candlebox.&nbsp; It blew day after day: it blew

<P>with spite, without interval, without mercy, without rest.

<P>The world was nothing but an immensity of great foam-

<P>ing waves rushing at us, under a sky low enough to

<P>touch with the hand and dirty like a smoked ceiling.&nbsp; In

<P>the stormy space surrounding us there was as much flying

<P>spray as air.&nbsp; Day after day and night after night there

<P>was nothing round the ship but the howl of the wind,

<P>the tumult of the sea, the noise of water pouring over

<P>her deck.&nbsp; There was no rest for her and no rest for us.

<P>She tossed, she pitched, she stood on her head, she sat on

<P>her tail, she rolled, she groaned, and we had to hold on

<P>while on deck and cling to our bunks when below, in a

<P>constant effort of body and worry of mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One night Mahon spoke through the small window

<P>of my berth.&nbsp; It opened right into my very bed, and I

<P>was lying there sleepless, in my boots, feeling as though

<P>I had not slept for years, and could not if I tried.&nbsp; He

<P>said excitedly--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'You got the sounding-rod in here, Marlow?&nbsp; I can't

<P>get the pumps to suck.&nbsp; By God! it's no child's play.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I gave him the sounding-rod and lay down again,

<P>trying to think of various things--but I thought only

<P>of the pumps.&nbsp; When I came on deck they were still at

<P>it, and my watch relieved at the pumps.&nbsp; By the light of

<P>the lantern brought on deck to examine the sounding-

<P>rod I caught a glimpse of their weary, serious faces.

<P>We pumped all the four hours.&nbsp; We pumped all night,

<P>all day, all the week,--watch and watch.&nbsp; She was work-

<P>ing herself loose, and leaked badly--not enough to

<P>drown us at once, but enough to kill us with the work at

<P>the pumps.&nbsp; And while we pumped the ship was going

<P>from us piecemeal: the bulwarks went, the stanchions

<P>were torn out, the ventilators smashed, the cabin-door

<P>burst in.&nbsp; There was not a dry spot in the ship.&nbsp; She was

<P>being gutted bit by bit.&nbsp; The long-boat changed, as if

<P>by magic, into matchwood where she stood in her gripes.

<P>I had lashed her myself, and was rather proud of my

<P>handiwork, which had withstood so long the malice of

<P>the sea.&nbsp; And we pumped.&nbsp; And there was no break in

<P>the weather.&nbsp; The sea was white like a sheet of foam,

<P>like a caldron of boiling milk; there was not a break in

<P>the clouds, no--not the size of a man's hand--no, not

<P>for so much as ten seconds.&nbsp; There was for us no sky,

<P>there were for us no stars, no sun, no universe--nothing

<P>but angry clouds and an infuriated sea.&nbsp; We pumped

<P>watch and watch, for dear life; and it seemed to last for

<P>months, for years, for all eternity, as though we had been

<P>dead and gone to a hell for sailors.&nbsp; We forgot the day

<P>of the week, the name of the month, what year it was,

<P>and whether we had ever been ashore.&nbsp; The sails blew

<P>away, she lay broadside on under a weather-cloth, the

<P>ocean poured over her, and we did not care.&nbsp; We turned

<P>those handles, and had the eyes of idiots.&nbsp; As soon as we

<P>had crawled on deck I used to take a round turn with a

<P>rope about the men, the pumps, and the mainmast, and

<P>we turned, we turned incessantly, with the water to our

<P>waists, to our necks, over our heads.&nbsp; It was all one.

<P>We had forgotten how it felt to be dry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And there was somewhere in me the thought: By

<P>Jove! this is the deuce of an adventure--something you

<P>read about; and it is my first voyage as second mate--

<P>and I am only twenty--and here I am lasting it out as

<P>well as any of these men, and keeping my chaps up to

<P>the mark.&nbsp; I was pleased.&nbsp; I would not have given up

<P>the experience for worlds.&nbsp; I had moments of exultation.

<P>Whenever the old dismantled craft pitched heavily with

<P>her counter high in the air, she seemed to me to throw

<P>up, like an appeal, like a defiance, like a cry to the clouds

<P>without mercy, the words written on her stern: 'Judea,

<P>London.&nbsp; Do or Die.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"O youth!&nbsp; The strength of it, the faith of it, the

<P>imagination of it!&nbsp; To me she was not an old rattle-trap

<P>carting about the world a lot of coal for a freight--to

<P>me she was the endeavor, the test, the trial of life.&nbsp; I

<P>think of her with pleasure, with affection, with regret--

<P>as you would think of someone dead you have loved.&nbsp; I

<P>shall never forget her. . . .&nbsp; Pass the bottle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One night when tied to the mast, as I explained, we

<P>were pumping on, deafened with the wind, and without

<P>spirit enough in us to wish ourselves dead, a heavy sea

<P>crashed aboard and swept clean over us.&nbsp; As soon as I

<P>got my breath I shouted, as in duty bound, 'Keep on,

<P>boys!' when suddenly I felt something hard floating on

<P>deck strike the calf of my leg.&nbsp; I made a grab at it and

<P>missed.&nbsp; It was so dark we could not see each other's

<P>faces within a foot--you understand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"After that thump the ship kept quiet for a while,

<P>and the thing, whatever it was, struck my leg again.

<P>This time I caught it--and it was a sauce-pan.&nbsp; At first,

<P>being stupid with fatigue and thinking of nothing but

<P>the pumps, I did not understand what I had in my hand.

<P>Suddenly it dawned upon me, and I shouted, 'Boys, the

<P>house on deck is gone.&nbsp; Leave this, and let's look for the

<P>cook.'

<P>"There was a deck-house forward, which contained

<P>the galley, the cook's berth, and the quarters of the

<P>crew.&nbsp; As we had expected for days to see it swept away,

<P>the hands had been ordered to sleep in the cabin--the

<P>only safe place in the ship.&nbsp; The steward, Abraham,

<P>however, persisted in clinging to his berth, stupidly, like

<P>a mule--from sheer fright I believe, like an animal that

<P>on't leave a stable falling in an earthquake.&nbsp; So we

<P>went to look for him.&nbsp; It was chancing death, since once

<P>out of our lashings we were as exposed as if on a raft.

<P>But we went.&nbsp; The house was shattered as if a shell had

<P>exploded inside.&nbsp; Most of it had gone overboard--stove,

<P>men's quarters, and their property, all was gone; but

<P>two posts, holding a portion of the bulkhead to which

<P>Abraham's bunk was attached, remained as if by a mir-

<P>acle.&nbsp; We groped in the ruins and came upon this, and

<P>there he was, sitting in his bunk, surrounded by foam and

<P>wreckage, jabbering cheerfully to himself.&nbsp; He was out

<P>of his mind; completely and for ever mad, with this

<P>sudden shock coming upon the fag-end of his endurance.

<P>We snatched him up, lugged him aft, and pitched him

<P>head-first down the cabin companion.&nbsp; You understand

<P>there was no time to carry him down with infinite pre-

<P>cautions and wait to see how he got on.&nbsp; Those below

<P>would pick him up at the bottom of the stairs all right.

<P>We were in a hurry to go back to the pumps.&nbsp; That busi-

<P>ness could not wait.&nbsp; A bad leak is an inhuman thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One would think that the sole purpose of that fiend-

<P>ish gale had been to make a lunatic of that poor devil of

<P>a mulatto.&nbsp; It eased before morning, and next day the

<P>sky cleared, and as the sea went down the leak took up.

<P>When it came to bending a fresh set of sails the crew

<P>demanded to put back--and really there was nothing else

<P>to do.&nbsp; Boats gone, decks swept clean, cabin gutted, men

<P>without a stitch but what they stood in, stores spoiled,

<P>ship strained.&nbsp; We put her head for home, and--would

<P>you believe it?&nbsp; The wind came east right in our teeth.

<P>It blew fresh, it blew continuously.&nbsp; We had to beat up

<P>every inch of the way, but she did not leak so badly,

<P>the water keeping comparatively smooth.&nbsp; Two hours'

<P>pumping in every four is no joke--but it kept her afloat

<P>as far as Falmouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The good people there live on casualties of the sea,

<P>and no doubt were glad to see us.&nbsp; A hungry crowd of

<P>shipwrights sharpened their chisels at the sight of that

<P>carcass of a ship.&nbsp; And, by Jove! they had pretty pick-

<P>ings off us before they were done.&nbsp; I fancy the owner

<P>was already in a tight place.&nbsp; There were delays.&nbsp; Then

<P>it was decided to take part of the cargo out and calk her

<P>topsides.&nbsp; This was done, the repairs finished, cargo re-

<P>shipped; a new crew came on board, and we went out--

<P>for Bankok.&nbsp; At the end of a week we were back again.

<P>The crew said they weren't going to Bankok--a hundred

<P>and fifty days' passage--in a something hooker that

<P>wanted pumping eight hours out of the twenty-four;

<P>and the nautical papers inserted again the little para-

<P>graph: 'Judea.&nbsp; Bark.&nbsp; Tyne to Bankok; coals; put

<P>back to Falmouth leaky and with crew refusing duty.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There were more delays--more tinkering.&nbsp; The

<P>owner came down for a day, and said she was as right as

<P>a little fiddle.&nbsp; Poor old Captain Beard looked like the

<P>ghost of a Geordie skipper--through the worry and

<P>humiliation of it.&nbsp; Remember he was sixty, and it was his

<P>first command.&nbsp; Mahon said it was a foolish business,

<P>and would end badly.&nbsp; I loved the ship more than ever,

<P>and wanted awfully to get to Bankok.&nbsp; To Bankok!

<P>Magic name, blessed name.&nbsp; Mesopotamia wasn't a patch

<P>n it.&nbsp; Remember I was twenty, and it was my first second

<P>mate's billet, and the East was waiting for me.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We went out and anchored in the outer roads with a

<P>fresh crew--the third.&nbsp; She leaked worse than ever.

<P>It was as if those confounded shipwrights had actually

<P>made a hole in her.&nbsp; This time we did not even

<P>go outside.&nbsp; The crew simply refused to man the

<P>windlass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They towed us back to the inner harbor, and we be-

<P>came a fixture, a feature, an institution of the place.

<P>People pointed us out to visitors as 'That 'ere bark

<P>that's going to Bankok--has been here six months--put

<P>back three times.'&nbsp; On holidays the small boys pulling

<P>about in boats would hail, 'Judea, ahoy!' and if a head

<P>showed above the rail shouted, 'Where you bound to?--

<P>Bankok?' and jeered.&nbsp; We were only three on board.

<P>The poor old skipper mooned in the cabin.&nbsp; Mahon un-

<P>dertook the cooking, and unexpectedly developed all a

<P>Frenchman's genius for preparing nice little messes.&nbsp; I

<P>looked languidly after the rigging.&nbsp; We became citizens

<P>of Falmouth.&nbsp; Every shopkeeper knew us.&nbsp; At the bar-

<P>ber's or tobacconist's they asked familiarly, 'Do you

<P>think you will ever get to Bankok?'&nbsp; Meantime the

<P>owner, the underwriters, and the charterers squabbled

<P>amongst themselves in London, and our pay went on.

<P>. . .&nbsp; Pass the bottle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was horrid.&nbsp; Morally it was worse than pumping

<P>for life.&nbsp; It seemed as though we had been forgotten by

<P>the world, belonged to nobody, would get nowhere; it

<P>seemed that, as if bewitched, we would have to live for

<P>ever and ever in that inner harbor, a derision and a by-

<P>word to generations of long-shore loafers and dishonest

<P>boatmen.&nbsp; I obtained three months' pay and a five days'

<P>leave, and made a rush for London.&nbsp; It took me a day

<P>to get there and pretty well another to come back--but

<P>three months' pay went all the same.&nbsp; I don't know what

<P>I did with it.&nbsp; I went to a music-hall, I believe, lunched,

<P>dined, and supped in a swell place in Regent Street, and

<P>was back to time, with nothing but a complete set of

<P>Byron's works and a new railway rug to show for three

<P>months' work.&nbsp; The boatman who pulled me off to the

<P>ship said: 'Hallo!&nbsp; I thought you had left the old thing.

<P>SHE will never get to Bankok.'&nbsp; 'That's all YOU know

<P>about it,' I said scornfully--but I didn't like that proph-

<P>ecy at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suddenly a man, some kind of agent to somebody,

<P>appeared with full powers.&nbsp; He had grog blossoms all

<P>over his face, an indomitable energy, and was a jolly

<P>soul.&nbsp; We leaped into life again.&nbsp; A hulk came along-

<P>side, took our cargo, and then we went into dry dock to

<P>get our copper stripped.&nbsp; No wonder she leaked.&nbsp; The

<P>poor thing, strained beyond endurance by the gale, had,

<P>as if in disgust, spat out all the oakum of her lower

<P>seams.&nbsp; She was recalked, new coppered, and made as

<P>tight as a bottle.&nbsp; We went back to the hulk and re-

<P>shipped our cargo.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then on a fine moonlight night, all the rats left the

<P>ship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had been infested with them.&nbsp; They had destroyed

<P>our sails, consumed more stores than the crew, affably

<P>shared our beds and our dangers, and now, when the

<P>ship was made seaworthy, concluded to clear out.&nbsp; I

<P>called Mahon to enjoy the spectacle.&nbsp; Rat after rat ap-

<P>peared on our rail, took a last look over his shoulder,

<P>and leaped with a hollow thud into the empty hulk.

<P>We tried to count them, but soon lost the tale.&nbsp; Mahon

<P>said: 'Well, well! don't talk to me about the intelligence

<P>of rats.&nbsp; They ought to have left before, when we had

<P>that narrow squeak from foundering.&nbsp; There you have

<P>the proof how silly is the superstition about them.&nbsp; They

<P>leave a good ship for an old rotten hulk, where there is

<P>nothing to eat, too, the fools! . . .&nbsp; I don't believe they

<P>know what is safe or what is good for them, any more

<P>than you or I.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And after some more talk we agreed that the wisdom

<P>of rats had been grossly overrated, being in fact no

<P>greater than that of men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The story of the ship was known, by this, all up the

<P>Channel from Land's End to the Forelands, and we

<P>could get no crew on the south coast.&nbsp; They sent us one

<P>all complete from Liverpool, and we left once more--for

<P>Bankok.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had fair breezes, smooth water right into the

<P>tropics, and the old Judea lumbered along in the sun-

<P>shine.&nbsp; When she went eight knots everything cracked

<P>aloft, and we tied our caps to our heads; but mostly she

<P>strolled on at the rate of three miles an hour.&nbsp; What

<P>could you expect?&nbsp; She was tired--that old ship.&nbsp; Her

<P>youth was where mine is--where yours is--you fellows

<P>who listen to this yarn; and what friend would throw

<P>your years and your weariness in your face?&nbsp; We didn't

<P>grumble at her.&nbsp; To us aft, at least, it seemed as though

<P>we had been born in her, reared in her, had lived in her

<P>for ages, had never known any other ship.&nbsp; I would

<P>just as soon have abused the old village church at home

<P>for not being a cathedral.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And for me there was also my youth to make me pa-

<P>tient.&nbsp; There was all the East before me, and all life, and

<P>the thought that I had been tried in that ship and had

<P>come out pretty well.&nbsp; And I thought of men of old who,

<P>centuries ago, went that road in ships that sailed no

<P>better, to the land of palms, and spices, and yellow sands,

<P>and of brown nations ruled by kings more cruel than

<P>Nero the Roman and more splendid than Solomon the

<P>Jew.&nbsp; The old bark lumbered on, heavy with her age

<P>and the burden of her cargo, while I lived the life of

<P>youth in ignorance and hope.&nbsp; She lumbered on through

<P>an interminable procession of days; and the fresh gild-

<P>ing flashed back at the setting sun, seemed to cry out

<P>over the darkening sea the words painted on her stern,

<P>'Judea, London.&nbsp; Do or Die.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then we entered the Indian Ocean and steered north-

<P>erly for Java Head.&nbsp; The winds were light.&nbsp; Weeks

<P>slipped by.&nbsp; She crawled on, do or die, and people at

<P>home began to think of posting us as overdue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One Saturday evening, I being off duty, the men

<P>asked me to give them an extra bucket of water or so--

<P>for washing clothes.&nbsp; As I did not wish to screw on the

<P>fresh-water pump so late, I went forward whistling, and

<P>with a key in my hand to unlock the forepeak scuttle,

<P>intending to serve the water out of a spare tank we kept

<P>there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The smell down below was as unexpected as it was

<P>frightful.&nbsp; One would have thought hundreds of par-

<P>affin-lamps had been flaring and smoking in that hole

<P>for days.&nbsp; I was glad to get out.&nbsp; The man with me

<P>coughed and said, 'Funny smell, sir.'&nbsp; I answered negli-

<P>gently, 'It's good for the health, they say,' and walked

<P>aft.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The first thing I did was to put my head down the

<P>square of the midship ventilator.&nbsp; As I lifted the lid a

<P>visible breath, something like a thin fog, a puff of faint

<P>haze, rose from the opening.&nbsp; The ascending air was hot,

<P>and had a heavy, sooty, paraffiny smell.&nbsp; I gave one sniff,

<P>and put down the lid gently.&nbsp; It was no use choking my-

<P>self.&nbsp; The cargo was on fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Next day she began to smoke in earnest.&nbsp; You see it

<P>was to be expected, for though the coal was of a safe

<P>kind, that cargo had been so handled, so broken up with

<P>handling, that it looked more like smithy coal than any-

<P>thing else.&nbsp; Then it had been wetted--more than once.

<P>It rained all the time we were taking it back from the

<P>hulk, and now with this long passage it got heated, and

<P>there was another case of spontaneous combustion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The captain called us into the cabin.&nbsp; He had a chart

<P>spread on the table, and looked unhappy.&nbsp; He said, 'The

<P>coast of West Australia is near, but I mean to proceed

<P>to our destination.&nbsp; It is the hurricane month too; but

<P>we will just keep her head for Bankok, and fight the fire.

<P>No more putting back anywhere, if we all get roasted.

<P>We will try first to stifle this 'ere damned combustion by

<P>want of air.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We tried.&nbsp; We battened down everything, and still

<P>she smoked.&nbsp; The smoke kept coming out through im-

<P>perceptible crevices; it forced itself through bulkheads

<P>and covers; it oozed here and there and everywhere in

<P>slender threads, in an invisible film, in an incomprehen-

<P>sible manner.&nbsp; It made its way into the cabin, into the

<P>forecastle; it poisoned the sheltered places on the deck,

<P>it could be sniffed as high as the mainyard.&nbsp; It was

<P>clear that if the smoke came out the air came in.&nbsp; This

<P>was disheartening.&nbsp; This combustion refused to be stifled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We resolved to try water, and took the hatches off.

<P>Enormous volumes of smoke, whitish, yellowish, thick,

<P>greasy, misty, choking, ascended as high as the trucks.

<P>All hands cleared out aft.&nbsp; Then the poisonous cloud

<P>blew away, and we went back to work in a smoke that

<P>was no thicker now than that of an ordinary factory

<P>chimney.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We rigged the force pump, got the hose along, and

<P>by-and-by it burst.&nbsp; Well, it was as old as the ship--a

<P>prehistoric hose, and past repair.&nbsp; Then we pumped with

<P>the feeble head-pump, drew water with buckets, and in

<P>this way managed in time to pour lots of Indian Ocean

<P>into the main hatch.&nbsp; The bright stream flashed in sun-

<P>shine, fell into a layer of white crawling smoke, and van-

<P>ished on the black surface of coal.&nbsp; Steam ascended

<P>mingling with the smoke.&nbsp; We poured salt water as into

<P>a barrel without a bottom.&nbsp; It was our fate to pump in

<P>that ship, to pump out of her, to pump into her; and

<P>after keeping water out of her to save ourselves from

<P>being drowned, we frantically poured water into her to

<P>save ourselves from being burnt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And she crawled on, do or die, in the serene weather.

<P>The sky was a miracle of purity, a miracle of azure.

<P>The sea was polished, was blue, was pellucid, was spark-

<P>ling like a precious stone, extending on all sides, all

<P>round to the horizon--as if the whole terrestrial globe

<P>had been one jewel, one colossal sapphire, a single gem

<P>fashioned into a planet.&nbsp; And on the luster of the great

<P>calm waters the Judea glided imperceptibly, enveloped

<P>in languid and unclean vapors, in a lazy cloud that

<P>drifted to leeward, light and slow: a pestiferous cloud

<P>defiling the splendor of sea and sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All this time of course we saw no fire.&nbsp; The cargo

<P>smoldered at the bottom somewhere.&nbsp; Once Mahon, as

<P>we were working side by side, said to me with a queer

<P>smile: 'Now, if she only would spring a tidy leak--

<P>like that time when we first left the Channel--it would

<P>put a stopper on this fire.&nbsp; Wouldn't it?'&nbsp; I remarked

<P>irrelevantly, 'Do you remember the rats?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We fought the fire and sailed the ship too as carefully

<P>as though nothing had been the matter.&nbsp; The steward

<P>cooked and attended on us.&nbsp; Of the other twelve men,

<P>eight worked while four rested.&nbsp; Everyone took his

<P>turn, captain included.&nbsp; There was equality, and if not

<P>exactly fraternity, then a deal of good feeling.&nbsp; Some-

<P>times a man, as he dashed a bucketful of water down the

<P>hatchway, would yell out, 'Hurrah for Bankok!' and the

<P>rest laughed.&nbsp; But generally we were taciturn and seri-

<P>ous--and thirsty.&nbsp; Oh! how thirsty!&nbsp; And we had to be

<P>careful with the water.&nbsp; Strict allowance.&nbsp; The ship

<P>smoked, the sun blazed. . . .&nbsp; Pass the bottle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We tried everything.&nbsp; We even made an attempt to

<P>dig down to the fire.&nbsp; No good, of course.&nbsp; No man

<P>could remain more than a minute below.&nbsp; Mahon, who

<P>went first, fainted there, and the man who went to fetch

<P>him out did likewise.&nbsp; We lugged them out on deck.

<P>Then I leaped down to show how easily it could be done.

<P>They had learned wisdom by that time, and contented

<P>themselves by fishing for me with a chain-hook tied to a

<P>broom-handle, I believe.&nbsp; I did not offer to go and fetch

<P>up my shovel, which was left down below.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Things began to look bad.&nbsp; We put the long-boat

<P>into the water.&nbsp; The second boat was ready to swing out.

<P>We had also another, a fourteen-foot thing, on davits

<P>aft, where it was quite safe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then behold, the smoke suddenly decreased.&nbsp; We re-

<P>doubled our efforts to flood the bottom of the ship.&nbsp; In

<P>two days there was no smoke at all.&nbsp; Everybody was on

<P>the broad grin.&nbsp; This was on a Friday.&nbsp; On Saturday no

<P>work, but sailing the ship of course was done.&nbsp; The men

<P>washed their clothes and their faces for the first time in

<P>a fortnight, and had a special dinner given them.&nbsp; They

<P>spoke of spontaneous combustion with contempt, and

<P>implied THEY were the boys to put out combustions.&nbsp; Some-

<P>how we all felt as though we each had inherited a large

<P>fortune.&nbsp; But a beastly smell of burning hung about the

<P>ship.&nbsp; Captain Beard had hollow eyes and sunken cheeks.

<P>I had never noticed so much before how twisted and

<P>bowed he was.&nbsp; He and Mahon prowled soberly about

<P>hatches and ventilators, sniffing.&nbsp; It struck me suddenly

<P>poor Mahon was a very, very old chap.&nbsp; As to me, I was

<P>as pleased and proud as though I had helped to win a

<P>great naval battle.&nbsp; O!&nbsp; Youth!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The night was fine.&nbsp; In the morning a homeward-

<P>bound ship passed us hull down,--the first we had seen

<P>for months; but we were nearing the land at last, Java

<P>Head being about 190 miles off, and nearly due

<P>north.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Next day it was my watch on deck from eight to

<P>twelve.&nbsp; At breakfast the captain observed, 'It's wonder-

<P>ful how that smell hangs about the cabin.'&nbsp; About ten,

<P>the mate being on the poop, I stepped down on the main-

<P>deck for a moment.&nbsp; The carpenter's bench stood abaft

<P>the mainmast: I leaned against it sucking at my pipe,

<P>and the carpenter, a young chap, came to talk to me.&nbsp; He

<P>remarked, 'I think we have done very well, haven't we?'

<P>and then I perceived with annoyance the fool was try-

<P>ing to tilt the bench.&nbsp; I said curtly, 'Don't, Chips,' and

<P>immediately became aware of a queer sensation, of an

<P>absurd delusion,--I seemed somehow to be in the air.&nbsp; I

<P>heard all round me like a pent-up breath released--as

<P>if a thousand giants simultaneously had said Phoo!--

<P>and felt a dull concussion which made my ribs ache sud-

<P>denly.&nbsp; No doubt about it--I was in the air, and my

<P>body was describing a short parabola.&nbsp; But short as it

<P>was, I had the time to think several thoughts in, as far

<P>as I can remember, the following order: 'This can't be

<P>the carpenter--What is it?--Some accident--Submarine

<P>volcano?--Coals, gas!--By Jove! we are being blown

<P>up--Everybody's dead--I am falling into the after-

<P>hatch--I see fire in it.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The coal-dust suspended in the air of the hold had

<P>glowed dull-red at the moment of the explosion.&nbsp; In

<P>the twinkling of an eye, in an infinitesimal fraction of a

<P>second since the first tilt of the bench, I was sprawling

<P>full length on the cargo.&nbsp; I picked myself up and scram-

<P>bled out.&nbsp; It was quick like a rebound.&nbsp; The deck was a

<P>wilderness of smashed timber, lying crosswise like trees in

<P>a wood after a hurricane; an immense curtain of soiled

<P>rags waved gently before me--it was the mainsail blown

<P>to strips.&nbsp; I thought, The masts will be toppling over

<P>directly; and to get out of the way bolted on all-fours

<P>towards the poop-ladder.&nbsp; The first person I saw was

<P>Mahon, with eyes like saucers, his mouth open, and the

<P>long white hair standing straight on end round his head

<P>like a silver halo.&nbsp; He was just about to go down when

<P>the sight of the main-deck stirring, heaving up, and

<P>changing into splinters before his eyes, petrified him on

<P>the top step.&nbsp; I stared at him in unbelief, and he stared

<P>at me with a queer kind of shocked curiosity.&nbsp; I did not

<P>know that I had no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, that

<P>my young mustache was burnt off, that my face was

<P>black, one cheek laid open, my nose cut, and my chin

<P>bleeding.&nbsp; I had lost my cap, one of my slippers, and

<P>my shirt was torn to rags.&nbsp; Of all this I was not aware.

<P>I was amazed to see the ship still afloat, the poop-deck

<P>whole--and, most of all, to see anybody alive.&nbsp; Also

<P>the peace of the sky and the serenity of the sea were

<P>istinctly surprising.&nbsp; I suppose I expected to see them

<P>convulsed with horror. . . .&nbsp; Pass the bottle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There was a voice hailing the ship from somewhere

<P>--in the air, in the sky--I couldn't tell.&nbsp; Presently I

<P>saw the captain--and he was mad.&nbsp; He asked me eagerly,

<P>'Where's the cabin-table?' and to hear such a question

<P>was a frightful shock.&nbsp; I had just been blown up, you

<P>understand, and vibrated with that experience,--I wasn't

<P>quite sure whether I was alive.&nbsp; Mahon began to stamp

<P>with both feet and yelled at him, 'Good God! don't you

<P>see the deck's blown out of her?'&nbsp; I found my voice, and

<P>stammered out as if conscious of some gross neglect of

<P>duty, 'I don't know where the cabin-table is.'&nbsp; It was

<P>like an absurd dream.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you know what he wanted next?&nbsp; Well, he

<P>wanted to trim the yards.&nbsp; Very placidly, and as if lost

<P>in thought, he insisted on having the foreyard squared.

<P>'I don't know if there's anybody alive,' said Mahon,

<P>almost tearfully.&nbsp; 'Surely,' he said gently, 'there will

<P>be enough left to square the foreyard.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The old chap, it seems, was in his own berth, wind-

<P>ing up the chronometers, when the shock sent him spin-

<P>ning.&nbsp; Immediately it occurred to him--as he said after-

<P>wards--that the ship had struck something, and he ran

<P>out into the cabin.&nbsp; There, he saw, the cabin-table had

<P>vanished somewhere.&nbsp; The deck being blown up, it had

<P>fallen down into the lazarette of course.&nbsp; Where we had

<P>our breakfast that morning he saw only a great hole in

<P>the floor.&nbsp; This appeared to him so awfully mysterious,

<P>and impressed him so immensely, that what he saw and

<P>heard after he got on deck were mere trifles in com-

<P>parison.&nbsp; And, mark, he noticed directly the wheel de-

<P>serted and his bark off her course--and his only

<P>thought was to get that miserable, stripped, undecked,

<P>smoldering shell of a ship back again with her head

<P>pointing at her port of destination.&nbsp; Bankok!&nbsp; That's

<P>what he was after.&nbsp; I tell you this quiet, bowed, bandy-

<P>legged, almost deformed little man was immense in the

<P>singleness of his idea and in his placid ignorance of

<P>our agitation.&nbsp; He motioned us forward with a com-

<P>manding gesture, and went to take the wheel him-

<P>self.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; that was the first thing we did--trim the yards

<P>of that wreck!&nbsp; No one was killed, or even disabled, but

<P>everyone was more or less hurt.&nbsp; You should have seen

<P>them!&nbsp; Some were in rags, with black faces, like coal-

<P>heavers, like sweeps, and had bullet heads that seemed

<P>closely cropped, but were in fact singed to the skin.

<P>Others, of the watch below, awakened by being shot out

<P>from their collapsing bunks, shivered incessantly, and

<P>kept on groaning even as we went about our work.&nbsp; But

<P>they all worked.&nbsp; That crew of Liverpool hard cases had

<P>in them the right stuff.&nbsp; It's my experience they always

<P>have.&nbsp; It is the sea that gives it--the vastness, the lone-

<P>liness surrounding their dark stolid souls.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Well!

<P>we stumbled, we crept, we fell, we barked our shins on

<P>the wreckage, we hauled.&nbsp; The masts stood, but we did

<P>not know how much they might be charred down below.

<P>It was nearly calm, but a long swell ran from the west

<P>and made her roll.&nbsp; They might go at any moment.&nbsp; We

<P>looked at them with apprehension.&nbsp; One could not fore-

<P>see which way they would fall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then we retreated aft and looked about us.&nbsp; The

<P>deck was a tangle of planks on edge, of planks on end,

<P>of splinters, of ruined woodwork.&nbsp; The masts rose from

<P>that chaos like big trees above a matted undergrowth.

<P>The interstices of that mass of wreckage were full of

<P>something whitish, sluggish, stirring--of something that

<P>was like a greasy fog.&nbsp; The smoke of the invisible fire

<P>was coming up again, was trailing, like a poisonous thick

<P>mist in some valley choked with dead wood.&nbsp; Already

<P>lazy wisps were beginning to curl upwards amongst the

<P>mass of splinters.&nbsp; Here and there a piece of timber,

<P>stuck upright, resembled a post.&nbsp; Half of a fife-rail had

<P>been shot through the foresail, and the sky made a

<P>patch of glorious blue in the ignobly soiled canvas.&nbsp; A

<P>portion of several boards holding together had fallen

<P>across the rail, and one end protruded overboard, like a

<P>gangway leading upon nothing, like a gangway leading

<P>over the deep sea, leading to death--as if inviting us to

<P>walk the plank at once and be done with our ridiculous

<P>troubles.&nbsp; And still the air, the sky--a ghost, something

<P>invisible was hailing the ship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Someone had the sense to look over, and there was

<P>the helmsman, who had impulsively jumped overboard,

<P>anxious to come back.&nbsp; He yelled and swam lustily like

<P>a merman, keeping up with the ship.&nbsp; We threw him a

<P>rope, and presently he stood amongst us streaming with

<P>water and very crest-fallen.&nbsp; The captain had surren-

<P>dered the wheel, and apart, elbow on rail and chin in

<P>hand, gazed at the sea wistfully.&nbsp; We asked ourselves,

<P>What next?&nbsp; I thought, Now, this is something like.

<P>This is great.&nbsp; I wonder what will happen.&nbsp; O youth!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suddenly Mahon sighted a steamer far astern.&nbsp; Cap-

<P>tain Beard said, 'We may do something with her yet.'

<P>We hoisted two flags, which said in the international

<P>language of the sea, 'On fire.&nbsp; Want immediate assis-

<P>tance.'&nbsp; The steamer grew bigger rapidly, and by-and-

<P>by spoke with two flags on her foremast, 'I am coming

<P>to your assistance.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In half an hour she was abreast, to windward, within

<P>hail, and rolling slightly, with her engines stopped.&nbsp; We

<P>lost our composure, and yelled all together with excite-

<P>ment, 'We've been blown up.'&nbsp; A man in a white helmet,

<P>on the bridge, cried, 'Yes!&nbsp; All right! all right!' and

<P>he nodded his head, and smiled, and made soothing mo-

<P>tions with his hand as though at a lot of frightened chil-

<P>dren.&nbsp; One of the boats dropped in the water, and

<P>walked towards us upon the sea with her long oars.&nbsp; Four

<P>Calashes pulled a swinging stroke.&nbsp; This was my first

<P>sight of Malay seamen.&nbsp; I've known them since, but

<P>what struck me then was their unconcern: they came

<P>alongside, and even the bowman standing up and holding

<P>to our main-chains with the boat-hook did not deign to

<P>lift his head for a glance.&nbsp; I thought people who had

<P>been blown up deserved more attention.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A little man, dry like a chip and agile like a monkey,

<P>clambered up.&nbsp; It was the mate of the steamer.&nbsp; He

<P>gave one look, and cried, 'O boys--you had better quit.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We were silent.&nbsp; He talked apart with the captain

<P>for a time,--seemed to argue with him.&nbsp; Then they went

<P>away together to the steamer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When our skipper came back we learned that the

<P>steamer was the Sommerville, Captain Nash, from West

<P>Australia to Singapore via Batavia with mails, and that

<P>the agreement was she should tow us to Anjer or Ba-

<P>tavia, if possible, where we could extinguish the fire by

<P>scuttling, and then proceed on our voyage--to Bankok!

<P>The old man seemed excited.&nbsp; 'We will do it yet,' he

<P>said to Mahon, fiercely.&nbsp; He shook his fist at the sky.

<P>Nobody else said a word.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At noon the steamer began to tow.&nbsp; She went ahead

<P>slim and high, and what was left of the Judea followed

<P>at the end of seventy fathom of tow-rope,--followed

<P>her swiftly like a cloud of smoke with mastheads pro-

<P>truding above.&nbsp; We went aloft to furl the sails.&nbsp; We

<P>coughed on the yards, and were careful about the bunts.

<P>Do you see the lot of us there, putting a neat furl on the

<P>sails of that ship doomed to arrive nowhere?&nbsp; There

<P>was not a man who didn't think that at any moment the

<P>masts would topple over.&nbsp; From aloft we could not see

<P>the ship for smoke, and they worked carefully, passing

<P>the gaskets with even turns.&nbsp; 'Harbor furl--aloft

<P>there!' cried Mahon from below.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You understand this?&nbsp; I don't think one of those

<P>chaps expected to get down in the usual way.&nbsp; When

<P>we did I heard them saying to each other, 'Well, I

<P>thought we would come down overboard, in a lump--

<P>sticks and all--blame me if I didn't.'&nbsp; 'That's what I

<P>was thinking to myself,' would answer wearily another

<P>battered and bandaged scarecrow.&nbsp; And, mind, these were

<P>men without the drilled-in habit of obedience.&nbsp; To an

<P>onlooker they would be a lot of profane scallywags

<P>without a redeeming point.&nbsp; What made them do it--

<P>what made them obey me when I, thinking consciously

<P>how fine it was, made them drop the bunt of the foresail

<P>twice to try and do it better?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; They had no pro-

<P>fessional reputation--no examples, no praise.&nbsp; It wasn't

<P>a sense of duty; they all knew well enough how to shirk,

<P>and laze, and dodge--when they had a mind to it--and

<P>mostly they had.&nbsp; Was it the two pounds ten a month

<P>that sent them there?&nbsp; They didn't think their pay half

<P>good enough.&nbsp; No; it was something in them, something

<P>inborn and subtle and everlasting.&nbsp; I don't say posi-

<P>tively that the crew of a French or German merchant-

<P>man wouldn't have done it, but I doubt whether it would

<P>have been done in the same way.&nbsp; There was a complete-

<P>ness in it, something solid like a principle, and masterful

<P>like an instinct--a disclosure of something secret--of

<P>that hidden something, that gift, of good or evil that

<P>makes racial difference, that shapes the fate of nations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was that night at ten that, for the first time since

<P>we had been fighting it, we saw the fire.&nbsp; The speed of

<P>the towing had fanned the smoldering destruction.&nbsp; A

<P>blue gleam appeared forward, shining below the wreck

<P>of the deck.&nbsp; It wavered in patches, it seemed to stir and

<P>creep like the light of a glowworm.&nbsp; I saw it first, and

<P>told Mahon.&nbsp; 'Then the game's up,' he said.&nbsp; 'We had

<P>better stop this towing, or she will burst out suddenly

<P>fore and aft before we can clear out.'&nbsp; We set up a yell;

<P>rang bells to attract their attention; they towed on.&nbsp; At

<P>last Mahon and I had to crawl forward and cut the rope

<P>with an ax.&nbsp; There was no time to cast off the lashings.

<P>Red tongues could be seen licking the wilderness of

<P>splinters under our feet as we made our way back to the

<P>poop.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course they very soon found out in the steamer

<P>that the rope was gone.&nbsp; She gave a loud blast of her

<P>whistle, her lights were seen sweeping in a wide circle, she

<P>came up ranging close alongside, and stopped.&nbsp; We were

<P>all in a tight group on the poop looking at her.&nbsp; Every

<P>man had saved a little bundle or a bag.&nbsp; Suddenly a con-

<P>ical flame with a twisted top shot up forward and threw

<P>upon the black sea a circle of light, with the two vessels

<P>side by side and heaving gently in its center.&nbsp; Captain

<P>Beard had been sitting on the gratings still and mute for

<P>hours, but now he rose slowly and advanced in front of

<P>us, to the mizzen-shrouds.&nbsp; Captain Nash hailed: 'Come

<P>along!&nbsp; Look sharp.&nbsp; I have mail-bags on board.&nbsp; I will

<P>take you and your boats to Singapore.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Thank you!&nbsp; No!' said our skipper.&nbsp; 'We must see

<P>the last of the ship.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'I can't stand by any longer,' shouted the other.

<P>'Mails--you know.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Ay! ay!&nbsp; We are all right.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Very well!&nbsp; I'll report you in Singapore. . . .

<P>Good-by!'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He waved his hand.&nbsp; Our men dropped their bundles

<P>quietly.&nbsp; The steamer moved ahead, and passing out of

<P>the circle of light, vanished at once from our sight, daz-

<P>zled by the fire which burned fiercely.&nbsp; And then I knew

<P>that I would see the East first as commander of a small

<P>boat.&nbsp; I thought it fine; and the fidelity to the old ship

<P>was fine.&nbsp; We should see the last of her.&nbsp; Oh the glamour

<P>of youth!&nbsp; Oh the fire of it, more dazzling than the

<P>flames of the burning ship, throwing a magic light on the

<P>wide earth, leaping audaciously to the sky, presently to

<P>be quenched by time, more cruel, more pitiless, more

<P>bitter than the sea--and like the flames of the burning

<P>ship surrounded by an impenetrable night.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The old man warned us in his gentle and inflexible

<P>way that it was part of our duty to save for the under-

<P>writers as much as we could of the ship's gear.&nbsp; Accord-

<P>ing we went to work aft, while she blazed forward to give

<P>us plenty of light.&nbsp; We lugged out a lot of rubbish.

<P>What didn't we save?&nbsp; An old barometer fixed with an

<P>absurd quantity of screws nearly cost me my life: a

<P>sudden rush of smoke came upon me, and I just got

<P>away in time.&nbsp; There were various stores, bolts of canvas,

<P>coils of rope; the poop looked like a marine bazaar, and

<P>the boats were lumbered to the gunwales.&nbsp; One would

<P>have thought the old man wanted to take as much as he

<P>could of his first command with him.&nbsp; He was very very

<P>quiet, but off his balance evidently.&nbsp; Would you believe

<P>it?&nbsp; He wanted to take a length of old stream-cable and

<P>a kedge-anchor with him in the long-boat.&nbsp; We said,

<P>'Ay, ay, sir,' deferentially, and on the quiet let the

<P>thing slip overboard.&nbsp; The heavy medicine-chest went

<P>that way, two bags of green coffee, tins of paint--fancy,

<P>paint!--a whole lot of things.&nbsp; Then I was ordered with

<P>two hands into the boats to make a stowage and get them

<P>ready against the time it would be proper for us to leave

<P>the ship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We put everything straight, stepped the long-boat's

<P>mast for our skipper, who was in charge of her, and I

<P>was not sorry to sit down for a moment.&nbsp; My face felt

<P>raw, every limb ached as if broken, I was aware of all

<P>my ribs, and would have sworn to a twist in the back-

<P>bone.&nbsp; The boats, fast astern, lay in a deep shadow, and

<P>all around I could see the circle of the sea lighted by the

<P>fire.&nbsp; A gigantic flame arose forward straight and clear.

<P>It flared there, with noises like the whir of wings, with

<P>rumbles as of thunder.&nbsp; There were cracks, detonations,

<P>and from the cone of flame the sparks flew upwards, as

<P>man is born to trouble, to leaky ships, and to ships that

<P>burn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What bothered me was that the ship, lying broadside

<P>to the swell and to such wind as there was--a mere breath--

<P>the boats would not keep astern where they were safe,

<P>but persisted, in a pig-headed way boats have, in getting

<P>under the counter and then swinging alongside.&nbsp; They

<P>were knocking about dangerously and coming near the

<P>flame, while the ship rolled on them, and, of course, there

<P>was always the danger of the masts going over the side

<P>at any moment.&nbsp; I and my two boat-keepers kept them

<P>off as best we could with oars and boat-hooks; but to be

<P>constantly at it became exasperating, since there was no

<P>reason why we should not leave at once.&nbsp; We could not

<P>see those on board, nor could we imagine what caused the

<P>delay.&nbsp; The boat-keepers were swearing feebly, and I

<P>had not only my share of the work, but also had to keep

<P>at it two men who showed a constant inclination to lay

<P>themselves down and let things slide.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At last I hailed 'On deck there,' and someone looked

<P>over.&nbsp; 'We're ready here,' I said.&nbsp; The head disap-

<P>peared, and very soon popped up again.&nbsp; 'The captain

<P>says, All right, sir, and to keep the boats well clear of the

<P>ship.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Half an hour passed.&nbsp; Suddenly there was a frightful

<P>racket, rattle, clanking of chain, hiss of water, and mil-

<P>lions of sparks flew up into the shivering column of smoke

<P>that stood leaning slightly above the ship.&nbsp; The cat-

<P>heads had burned away, and the two red-hot anchors had

<P>gone to the bottom, tearing out after them two hundred

<P>fathom of red-hot chain.&nbsp; The ship trembled, the mass of

<P>flame swayed as if ready to collapse, and the fore top-

<P>gallant-mast fell.&nbsp; It darted down like an arrow of fire,

<P>shot under, and instantly leaping up within an oar's-

<P>length of the boats, floated quietly, very black on the

<P>luminous sea.&nbsp; I hailed the deck again.&nbsp; After some time

<P>a man in an unexpectedly cheerful but also muffled tone,

<P>as though he had been trying to speak with his mouth

<P>shut, informed me, 'Coming directly, sir,' and vanished.

<P>For a long time I heard nothing but the whir and roar

<P>of the fire.&nbsp; There were also whistling sounds.&nbsp; The boats

<P>jumped, tugged at the painters, ran at each other play-

<P>fully, knocked their sides together, or, do what we would,

<P>swung in a bunch against the ship's side.&nbsp; I couldn't

<P>stand it any longer, and swarming up a rope, clambered

<P>aboard over the stern.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was as bright as day.&nbsp; Coming up like this, the

<P>sheet of fire facing me, was a terrifying sight, and the

<P>heat seemed hardly bearable at first.&nbsp; On a settee cushion

<P>dragged out of the cabin, Captain Beard, with his legs

<P>drawn up and one arm under his head, slept with the light

<P>playing on him.&nbsp; Do you know what the rest were busy

<P>about?&nbsp; They were sitting on deck right aft, round an

<P>open case, eating bread and cheese and drinking bottled

<P>stout.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"On the background of flames twisting in fierce tongues

<P>above their heads they seemed at home like salamanders,

<P>and looked like a band of desperate pirates.&nbsp; The fire

<P>sparkled in the whites of their eyes, gleamed on patches

<P>of white skin seen through the torn shirts.&nbsp; Each had

<P>the marks as of a battle about him--bandaged heads,

<P>tied-up arms, a strip of dirty rag round a knee--and

<P>each man had a bottle between his legs and a chunk of

<P>cheese in his hand.&nbsp; Mahon got up.&nbsp; With his handsome

<P>and disreputable head, his hooked profile, his long white

<P>beard, and with an uncorked bottle in his hand, he re-

<P>sembled one of those reckless sea-robbers of old making

<P>merry amidst violence and disaster.&nbsp; 'The last meal on

<P>board,' he explained solemnly.&nbsp; 'We had nothing to eat

<P>all day, and it was no use leaving all this.'&nbsp; He flourished

<P>the bottle and indicated the sleeping skipper.&nbsp; 'He said

<P>he couldn't swallow anything, so I got him to lie down,'

<P>he went on; and as I stared, 'I don't know whether you

<P>are aware, young fellow, the man had no sleep to speak

<P>of for days--and there will be dam' little sleep in the

<P>boats.'&nbsp; 'There will be no boats by-and-by if you fool

<P>about much longer,' I said, indignantly.&nbsp; I walked up to

<P>the skipper and shook him by the shoulder.&nbsp; At last he

<P>opened his eyes, but did not move.&nbsp; 'Time to leave her,

<P>sir,' I said, quietly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He got up painfully, looked at the flames, at the sea

<P>sparkling round the ship, and black, black as ink farther

<P>away; he looked at the stars shining dim through a thin

<P>veil of smoke in a sky black, black as Erebus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Youngest first,' he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And the ordinary seaman, wiping his mouth with the

<P>back of his hand, got up, clambered over the taffrail, and

<P>vanished.&nbsp; Others followed.&nbsp; One, on the point of going

<P>over, stopped short to drain his bottle, and with a great

<P>swing of his arm flung it at the fire.&nbsp; 'Take this!' he

<P>cried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The skipper lingered disconsolately, and we left him

<P>to commune alone for awhile with his first command.

<P>Then I went up again and brought him away at last.&nbsp; It

<P>was time.&nbsp; The ironwork on the poop was hot to the

<P>touch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then the painter of the long-boat was cut, and the

<P>three boats, tied together, drifted clear of the ship.&nbsp; It

<P>was just sixteen hours after the explosion when we aban-

<P>doned her.&nbsp; Mahon had charge of the second boat, and I

<P>had the smallest--the 14-foot thing.&nbsp; The long-boat

<P>would have taken the lot of us; but the skipper said we

<P>must save as much property as we could--for the under-

<P>writers--and so I got my first command.&nbsp; I had two men

<P>with me, a bag of biscuits, a few tins of meat, and a

<P>breaker of water.&nbsp; I was ordered to keep close to the

<P>long-boat, that in case of bad weather we might be taken

<P>into her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And do you know what I thought?&nbsp; I thought I

<P>would part company as soon as I could.&nbsp; I wanted to

<P>have my first command all to myself.&nbsp; I wasn't going to

<P>sail in a squadron if there were a chance for independ-

<P>ent cruising.&nbsp; I would make land by myself.&nbsp; I would

<P>beat the other boats.&nbsp; Youth!&nbsp; All youth!&nbsp; The silly,

<P>charming, beautiful youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But we did not make a start at once.&nbsp; We must see

<P>the last of the ship.&nbsp; And so the boats drifted about that

<P>night, heaving and setting on the swell.&nbsp; The men dozed,

<P>waked, sighed, groaned.&nbsp; I looked at the burning ship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Between the darkness of earth and heaven she was

<P>burning fiercely upon a disc of purple sea shot by the

<P>blood-red play of gleams; upon a disc of water glitter-

<P>ing and sinister.&nbsp; A high, clear flame, an immense and

<P>lonely flame, ascended from the ocean, and from its sum-

<P>mit the black smoke poured continuously at the sky.&nbsp; She

<P>burned furiously, mournful and imposing like a funeral

<P>pile kindled in the night, surrounded by the sea, watched

<P>over by the stars.&nbsp; A magnificent death had come like a

<P>grace, like a gift, like a reward to that old ship at the

<P>end of her laborious days.&nbsp; The surrender of her weary

<P>ghost to the keeping of stars and sea was stirring like the

<P>sight of a glorious triumph.&nbsp; The masts fell just before

<P>daybreak, and for a moment there was a burst and tur-

<P>moil of sparks that seemed to fill with flying fire the night

<P>patient and watchful, the vast night lying silent upon

<P>the sea.&nbsp; At daylight she was only a charred shell, float-

<P>ing still under a cloud of smoke and bearing a glowing

<P>mass of coal within.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then the oars were got out, and the boats forming in

<P>a line moved round her remains as if in procession--the

<P>long-boat leading.&nbsp; As we pulled across her stern a slim

<P>dart of fire shot out viciously at us, and suddenly she

<P>went down, head first, in a great hiss of steam.&nbsp; The

<P>unconsumed stern was the last to sink; but the paint had

<P>gone, had cracked, had peeled off, and there were no

<P>letters, there was no word, no stubborn device that was

<P>like her soul, to flash at the rising sun her creed and her

<P>name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We made our way north.&nbsp; A breeze sprang up, and

<P>about noon all the boats came together for the last time.

<P>I had no mast or sail in mine, but I made a mast out of a

<P>spare oar and hoisted a boat-awning for a sail, with a

<P>boat-hook for a yard.&nbsp; She was certainly over-masted,

<P>but I had the satisfaction of knowing that with the wind

<P>aft I could beat the other two.&nbsp; I had to wait for them.

<P>Then we all had a look at the captain's chart, and, after

<P>a sociable meal of hard bread and water, got our last

<P>instructions.&nbsp; These were simple: steer north, and keep

<P>together as much as possible.&nbsp; 'Be careful with that

<P>jury rig, Marlow,' said the captain; and Mahon, as I

<P>sailed proudly past his boat, wrinkled his curved nose

<P>and hailed, 'You will sail that ship of yours under

<P>water, if you don't look out, young fellow.'&nbsp; He was a

<P>malicious old man--and may the deep sea where he sleeps

<P>now rock him gently, rock him tenderly to the end of time!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Before sunset a thick rain-squall passed over the two

<P>boats, which were far astern, and that was the last I

<P>saw of them for a time.&nbsp; Next day I sat steering my

<P>cockle-shell--my first command--with nothing but water

<P>and sky around me.&nbsp; I did sight in the afternoon the

<P>upper sails of a ship far away, but said nothing, and my

<P>men did not notice her.&nbsp; You see I was afraid she might

<P>be homeward bound, and I had no mind to turn back

<P>from the portals of the East.&nbsp; I was steering for Java--

<P>another blessed name--like Bankok, you know.&nbsp; I steered

<P>many days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I need not tell you what it is to be knocking about in

<P>an open boat.&nbsp; I remember nights and days of calm when

<P>we pulled, we pulled, and the boat seemed to stand still,

<P>as if bewitched within the circle of the sea horizon.&nbsp; I

<P>remember the heat, the deluge of rain-squalls that kept

<P>us baling for dear life (but filled our water-cask), and I

<P>remember sixteen hours on end with a mouth dry as a

<P>cinder and a steering-oar over the stern to keep my first

<P>command head on to a breaking sea.&nbsp; I did not know how

<P>good a man I was till then.&nbsp; I remember the drawn faces,

<P>the dejected figures of my two men, and I remember my

<P>youth and the feeling that will never come back any

<P>more--the feeling that I could last for ever, outlast the

<P>sea, the earth, and all men; the deceitful feeling that

<P>lures us on to joys, to perils, to love, to vain effort--to

<P>death; the triumphant conviction of strength, the heat

<P>of life in the handful of dust, the glow in the heart that

<P>with every year grows dim, grows cold, grows small, and

<P>expires--and expires, too soon--before life itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And this is how I see the East.&nbsp; I have seen its secret

<P>places and have looked into its very soul; but now I see

<P>it always from a small boat, a high outline of mountains,

<P>blue and afar in the morning; like faint mist at noon; a

<P>jagged wall of purple at sunset.&nbsp; I have the feel of the

<P>oar in my hand, the vision of a scorching blue sea in my

<P>eyes.&nbsp; And I see a bay, a wide bay, smooth as glass and

<P>polished like ice, shimmering in the dark.&nbsp; A red light

<P>burns far off upon the gloom of the land, and the night

<P>is soft and warm.&nbsp; We drag at the oars with aching arms,

<P>and suddenly a puff of wind, a puff faint and tepid and

<P>laden with strange odors of blossoms, of aromatic wood,

<P>comes out of the still night--the first sigh of the East on

<P>my face.&nbsp; That I can never forget.&nbsp; It was impalpable

<P>and enslaving, like a charm, like a whispered promise of

<P>mysterious delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We had been pulling this finishing spell for eleven

<P>hours.&nbsp; Two pulled, and he whose turn it was to rest sat

<P>at the tiller.&nbsp; We had made out the red light in that bay

<P>and steered for it, guessing it must mark some small

<P>coasting port.&nbsp; We passed two vessels, outlandish and

<P>high-sterned, sleeping at anchor, and, approaching the

<P>light, now very dim, ran the boat's nose against the end

<P>of a jutting wharf.&nbsp; We were blind with fatigue.&nbsp; My

<P>men dropped the oars and fell off the thwarts as if dead.

<P>I made fast to a pile.&nbsp; A current rippled softly.&nbsp; The

<P>scented obscurity of the shore was grouped into vast

<P>masses, a density of colossal clumps of vegetation, prob-

<P>ably--mute and fantastic shapes.&nbsp; And at their foot the

<P>semicircle of a beach gleamed faintly, like an illusion.

<P>There was not a light, not a stir, not a sound.&nbsp; The mys-

<P>terious East faced me, perfumed like a flower, silent like

<P>death, dark like a grave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I sat weary beyond expression, exulting like a

<P>conqueror, sleepless and entranced as if before a pro-

<P>found, a fateful enigma.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A splashing of oars, a measured dip reverberating

<P>on the level of water, intensified by the silence of the

<P>shore into loud claps, made me jump up.&nbsp; A boat, a

<P>European boat, was coming in.&nbsp; I invoked the name

<P>of the dead; I hailed: Judea ahoy!&nbsp; A thin shout an-

<P>swered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was the captain.&nbsp; I had beaten the flagship by three

<P>hours, and I was glad to hear the old man's voice, tremu-

<P>lous and tired.&nbsp; 'Is it you, Marlow?'&nbsp; 'Mind the end of

<P>that jetty, sir,' I cried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He approached cautiously, and brought up with the

<P>deep-sea lead-line which we had saved--for the under-

<P>writers.&nbsp; I eased my painter and fell alongside.&nbsp; He

<P>sat, a broken figure at the stern, wet with dew, his hands

<P>clasped in his lap.&nbsp; His men were asleep already.&nbsp; 'I

<P>had a terrible time of it,' he murmured.&nbsp; 'Mahon is be-

<P>hind--not very far.'&nbsp; We conversed in whispers, in low

<P>whispers, as if afraid to wake up the land.&nbsp; Guns, thun-

<P>der, earthquakes would not have awakened the men just

<P>then.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Looking around as we talked, I saw away at sea a

<P>bright light traveling in the night.&nbsp; 'There's a steamer

<P>passing the bay,' I said.&nbsp; She was not passing, she was

<P>entering, and she even came close and anchored.&nbsp; 'I

<P>wish,' said the old man, 'you would find out whether she

<P>is English.&nbsp; Perhaps they could give us a passage some-

<P>where.'&nbsp; He seemed nervously anxious.&nbsp; So by dint of

<P>punching and kicking I started one of my men into a

<P>state of somnambulism, and giving him an oar, took

<P>another and pulled towards the lights of the steamer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There was a murmur of voices in her, metallic hollow

<P>clangs of the engine-room, footsteps on the deck.&nbsp; Her

<P>ports shone, round like dilated eyes.&nbsp; Shapes moved

<P>about, and there was a shadowy man high up on the

<P>bridge.&nbsp; He heard my oars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then, before I could open my lips, the East spoke

<P>to me, but it was in a Western voice.&nbsp; A torrent of words

<P>was poured into the enigmatical, the fateful silence;

<P>outlandish, angry words, mixed with words and even

<P>whole sentences of good English, less strange but even

<P>more surprising.&nbsp; The voice swore and cursed violently;

<P>it riddled the solemn peace of the bay by a volley of

<P>abuse.&nbsp; It began by calling me Pig, and from that went

<P>crescendo into unmentionable adjectives--in English.

<P>The man up there raged aloud in two languages, and

<P>with a sincerity in his fury that almost convinced me I

<P>had, in some way, sinned against the harmony of the

<P>universe.&nbsp; I could hardly see him, but began to think he

<P>would work himself into a fit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suddenly he ceased, and I could hear him snorting and

<P>blowing like a porpoise.&nbsp; I said--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'What steamer is this, pray?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Eh?&nbsp; What's this?&nbsp; And who are you?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Castaway crew of an English bark burnt at sea.

<P>We came here to-night.&nbsp; I am the second mate.&nbsp; The

<P>captain is in the long-boat, and wishes to know if you

<P>would give us a passage somewhere.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Oh, my goodness!&nbsp; I say. . . .&nbsp; This is the Celestial

<P>from Singapore on her return trip.&nbsp; I'll arrange with

<P>your captain in the morning, . . . and, . . . I say,

<P>. . . did you hear me just now?'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'I should think the whole bay heard you.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'I thought you were a shore-boat.&nbsp; Now, look here--

<P>this infernal lazy scoundrel of a caretaker has gone to

<P>sleep again--curse him.&nbsp; The light is out, and I nearly

<P>ran foul of the end of this damned jetty.&nbsp; This is the

<P>third time he plays me this trick.&nbsp; Now, I ask you, can

<P>anybody stand this kind of thing?&nbsp; It's enough to drive

<P>a man out of his mind.&nbsp; I'll report him. . . .&nbsp; I'll get the

<P>Assistant Resident to give him the sack, by . . .&nbsp; See--

<P>there's no light.&nbsp; It's out, isn't it?&nbsp; I take you to witness

<P>the light's out.&nbsp; There should be a light, you know.&nbsp; A

<P>red light on the--'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'There was a light,' I said, mildly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'But it's out, man!&nbsp; What's the use of talking like

<P>this?&nbsp; You can see for yourself it's out--don't you?&nbsp; If

<P>you had to take a valuable steamer along this God-for-

<P>saken coast you would want a light too.&nbsp; I'll kick him

<P>from end to end of his miserable wharf.&nbsp; You'll see if I

<P>don't.&nbsp; I will--'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'So I may tell my captain you'll take us?' I broke in.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'Yes, I'll take you.&nbsp; Good night,' he said, brusquely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I pulled back, made fast again to the jetty, and then

<P>went to sleep at last.&nbsp; I had faced the silence of the

<P>East.&nbsp; I had heard some of its languages.&nbsp; But when I

<P>opened my eyes again the silence was as complete as

<P>though it had never been broken.&nbsp; I was lying in a

<P>flood of light, and the sky had never looked so far, so

<P>high, before.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and lay without moving.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And then I saw the men of the East--they were

<P>looking at me.&nbsp; The whole length of the jetty was

<P>full of people.&nbsp; I saw brown, bronze, yellow faces,

<P>the black eyes, the glitter, the color of an Eastern

<P>crowd.&nbsp; And all these beings stared without a mur-

<P>mur, without a sigh, without a movement.&nbsp; They

<P>stared down at the boats, at the sleeping men who at

<P>night had come to them from the sea.&nbsp; Nothing moved.

<P>The fronds of palms stood still against the sky.&nbsp; Not a

<P>branch stirred along the shore, and the brown roofs of

<P>hidden houses peeped through the green foliage, through

<P>the big leaves that hung shining and still like leaves

<P>forged of heavy metal.&nbsp; This was the East of the ancient

<P>navigators, so old, so mysterious, resplendent and

<P>somber, living and unchanged, full of danger and prom-

<P>ise.&nbsp; And these were the men.&nbsp; I sat up suddenly.&nbsp; A

<P>wave of movement passed through the crowd from end

<P>to end, passed along the heads, swayed the bodies, ran

<P>along the jetty like a ripple on the water, like a breath

<P>of wind on a field--and all was still again.&nbsp; I see it now

<P>--the wide sweep of the bay, the glittering sands, the

<P>wealth of green infinite and varied, the sea blue like the

<P>sea of a dream, the crowd of attentive faces, the blaze of

<P>vivid color--the water reflecting it all, the curve of the

<P>shore, the jetty, the high-sterned outlandish craft float-

<P>ing still, and the three boats with tired men from the

<P>West sleeping unconscious of the land and the people

<P>and of the violence of sunshine.&nbsp; They slept thrown

<P>across the thwarts, curled on bottom-boards, in the care-

<P>less attitudes of death.&nbsp; The head of the old skipper,

<P>leaning back in the stern of the long-boat, had fallen on

<P>his breast, and he looked as though he would never wake.

<P>Farther out old Mahon's face was upturned to the sky,

<P>with the long white beard spread out on his breast, as

<P>though he had been shot where he sat at the tiller; and a

<P>man, all in a heap in the bows of the boat, slept with both

<P>arms embracing the stem-head and with his cheek laid on

<P>the gunwale.&nbsp; The East looked at them without a sound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have known its fascinations since: I have seen the

<P>mysterious shores, the still water, the lands of brown na-

<P>tions, where a stealthy Nemesis lies in wait, pursues,

<P>overtakes so many of the conquering race, who are proud

<P>of their wisdom, of their knowledge, of their strength.

<P>But for me all the East is contained in that vision of my

<P>youth.&nbsp; It is all in that moment when I opened my young

<P>eyes on it.&nbsp; I came upon it from a tussle with the sea--

<P>and I was young--and I saw it looking at me.&nbsp; And this

<P>is all that is left of it!&nbsp; Only a moment; a moment of

<P>strength, of romance, of glamour--of youth! . . .&nbsp; A

<P>flick of sunshine upon a strange shore, the time to re-

<P>member, the time for a sigh, and--good-by!--Night--

<P>Good-by . . .!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He drank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; The good old time--the good old time.&nbsp; Youth

<P>and the sea.&nbsp; Glamour and the sea!&nbsp; The good, strong

<P>sea, the salt, bitter sea, that could whisper to you and

<P>roar at you and knock your breath out of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He drank again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By all that's wonderful, it is the sea, I believe, the sea

<P>itself--or is it youth alone?&nbsp; Who can tell?&nbsp; But you

<P>here--you all had something out of life: money, love--

<P>whatever one gets on shore--and, tell me, wasn't that the

<P>best time, that time when we were young at sea; young

<P>and had nothing, on the sea that gives nothing, except

<P>hard knocks--and sometimes a chance to feel your

<P>strength--that only--what you all regret?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And we all nodded at him: the man of finance, the man

<P>of accounts, the man of law, we all nodded at him over

<P>the polished table that like a still sheet of brown water

<P>reflected our faces, lined, wrinkled; our faces marked

<P>by toil, by deceptions, by success, by love; our weary

<P>eyes looking still, looking always, looking anxiously for

<P>something out of life, that while it is expected is already

<P>gone--has passed unseen, in a sigh, in a flash--together

<P>with the youth, with the strength, with the romance of illusions.
