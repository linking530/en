<P>HE SHOOK hands with me: "Well, there you are, on
<BR>your own, appointed officially under my re-
<BR>sponsibility."

<P>He was actually walking with me to the door.
<BR>What a distance off it seemed!&nbsp; I moved like a
<BR>man in bonds.&nbsp; But we reached it at last.&nbsp; I opened
<BR>it with the sensation of dealing with mere dream-
<BR>stuff, and then at the last moment the fellowship
<BR>of seamen asserted itself, stronger than the differ-
<BR>ence of age and station.&nbsp; It asserted itself in
<BR>Captain Ellis' voice.

<P>"Good-bye--and good luck to you," he said so
<BR>heartily that I could only give him a grateful
<BR>glance.&nbsp; Then I turned and went out, never to see
<BR>him again in my life.&nbsp; I had not made three steps
<BR>into the outer office when I heard behind my back
<BR>a gruff, loud, authoritative voice, the voice of our
<BR>deputy-Neptune.

<P>It was addressing the head Shipping-Master
<BR>who, having let me in, had, apparently, remained
<BR>hovering in the middle distance ever since
<BR>"Mr. R., let the harbour launch have steam up to
<BR>take the captain here on board the Melita at half-
<BR>past nine to-night."

<P>I was amazed at the startled alacrity of R's
<BR>"Yes, sir."&nbsp; He ran before me out on the landing.
<BR>My new dignity sat yet so lightly on me that I was
<BR>not aware that it was I, the Captain, the object of
<BR>this last graciousness.&nbsp; It seemed as if all of a sud-
<BR>den a pair of wings had grown on my shoulders.&nbsp; I
<BR>merely skimmed along the polished floor.

<P>But R. was impressed.

<P>"I say!" he exclaimed on the landing, while the
<BR>Malay crew of the steam-launch standing by looked
<BR>stonily at the man for whom they were going to be
<BR>kept on duty so late, away from their gambling,
<BR>from their girls, or their pure domestic joys.&nbsp; "I
<BR>say!&nbsp; His own launch.&nbsp; What have you done to
<BR>him?"

<P>His stare was full of respectful curiosity.&nbsp; I was
<BR>quite confounded.

<P>"Was it for me?&nbsp; I hadn't the slightest notion,"
<BR>I stammered out.

<P>He nodded many times.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; And the last
<BR>person who had it before you was a Duke.&nbsp; So,
<BR>there!"

<P>I think he expected me to faint on the spot.
<BR>But I was in too much of a hurry for emotional
<BR>displays.&nbsp; My feelings were already in such a whirl
<BR>that this staggering information did not seem to
<BR>make the slightest difference.&nbsp; It merely fell into
<BR>the seething cauldron of my brain, and I carried it
<BR>off with me after a short but effusive passage of
<BR>leave-taking with R.

<P>The favour of the great throws an aureole round
<BR>the fortunate object of its selection.&nbsp; That ex-
<BR>cellent man enquired whether he could do anything
<BR>for me.&nbsp; He had known me only by sight, and he
<BR>was well aware he would never see me again; I was,
<BR>in common with the other seamen of the port,
<BR>merely a subject for official writing, filling up of
<BR>forms with all the artificial superiority of a man of
<BR>pen and ink to the men who grapple with realities
<BR>outside the consecrated walls of official buildings.
<BR>What ghosts we must have been to him!&nbsp; Mere
<BR>symbols to juggle with in books and heavy
<BR>registers, without brains and muscles and per-
<BR>plexities; something hardly useful and decidedly
<BR>inferior.

<P>And he--the office hours being over--wanted to
<BR>know if he could be of any use to me!

<P>I ought--properly speaking--I ought to have
<BR>been moved to tears.&nbsp; But I did not even think of it.
<BR>It was merely another miraculous manifestation of
<BR>that day of miracles.&nbsp; I parted from him as if he
<BR>were a mere symbol.&nbsp; I floated down the staircase.
<BR>I floated out of the official and imposing portal.&nbsp; I
<BR>went on floating along.

<P>I use that word rather than the word "flew," be-
<BR>cause I have a distinct impression that, though up-
<BR>lifted by my aroused youth, my movements were
<BR>deliberate enough.&nbsp; To that mixed white, brown,
<BR>and yellow portion of mankind, out abroad on their
<BR>own affairs, I presented the appearance of a man
<BR>walking rather sedately.&nbsp; And nothing in the way
<BR>of abstraction could have equalled my deep de-
<BR>tachment from the forms and colours of this world.
<BR>It was, as it were, final.

<P>And yet, suddenly, I recognized Hamilton.&nbsp; I
<BR>recognized him without effort, without a shock,
<BR>without a start.&nbsp; There he was, strolling toward
<BR>the Harbour Office with his stiff, arrogant dignity.
<BR>His red face made him noticeable at a distance.&nbsp; It
<BR>flamed, over there, on the shady side of the street.

<P>He had perceived me, too.&nbsp; Something (uncon-
<BR>scious exuberance of spirits perhaps) moved me to
<BR>wave my hand to him elaborately.&nbsp; This lapse
<BR>from good taste happened before I was aware that
<BR>I was capable of it.

<P>The impact of my impudence stopped him short,
<BR>much as a bullet might have done.&nbsp; I verily believe
<BR>he staggered, though as far as I could see he didn't
<BR>actually fall.&nbsp; I had gone past in a moment and did
<BR>not turn my head.&nbsp; I had forgotten his existence.

<P>The next ten minutes might have been ten
<BR>seconds or ten centuries for all my consciousness
<BR>had to do with it.&nbsp; People might have been falling
<BR>dead around me, houses crumbling, guns firing,
<BR>I wouldn't have known.&nbsp; I was thinking: "By
<BR>Jove!&nbsp; I have got it."&nbsp; IT being the command.&nbsp; It
<BR>had come about in a way utterly unforeseen in my
<BR>modest day-dreams.

<P>I perceived that my imagination had been run-
<BR>ning in conventional channels and that my hopes
<BR>had always been drab stuff.&nbsp; I had envisaged a
<BR>command as a result of a slow course of promotion
<BR>in the employ of some highly respectable firm.
<BR>The reward of faithful service.&nbsp; Well, faithful
<BR>service was all right.&nbsp; One would naturally give
<BR>that for one's own sake, for the sake of the ship,
<BR>for the love of the life of one's choice; not for the
<BR>sake of the reward.

<P>There is something distasteful in the notion of a
<BR>reward.

<P>And now here I had my command, absolutely in
<BR>my pocket, in a way undeniable indeed, but most
<BR>unexpected; beyond my imaginings, outside all
<BR>reasonable expectations, and even notwithstanding
<BR>the existence of some sort of obscure intrigue to
<BR>keep it away from me.&nbsp; It is true that the intrigue
<BR>was feeble, but it helped the feeling of wonder--as
<BR>if I had been specially destined for that ship I did
<BR>not know, by some power higher than the prosaic
<BR>agencies of the commercial world.

<P>A strange sense of exultation began to creep into
<BR>me.&nbsp; If I had worked for that command ten years
<BR>or more there would have been nothing of the kind.
<BR>I was a little frightened.

<P>"Let us be calm," I said to myself.

<P>Outside the door of the Officers' Home the
<BR>wretched Steward seemed to be waiting for me.
<BR>There was a broad flight of a few steps, and he ran
<BR>to and fro on the top of it as if chained there.&nbsp; A
<BR>distressed cur.&nbsp; He looked as though his throat
<BR>were too dry for him to bark.

<P>I regret to say I stopped before going in.&nbsp; There
<BR>had been a revolution in my moral nature.&nbsp; He
<BR>waited open-mouthed, breathless, while I looked
<BR>at him for half a minute.

<P>"And you thought you could keep me out of it,"
<BR>I said scathingly.

<P>"You said you were going home," he squeaked
<BR>miserably.&nbsp; "You said so.&nbsp; You said so."

<P>"I wonder what Captain Ellis will have to say
<BR>to that excuse," I uttered slowly with a sinister
<BR>meaning.

<P>His lower jaw had been trembling all the time and
<BR>his voice was like the bleating of a sick goat.&nbsp; "You
<BR>have given me away?&nbsp; You have done for me?"

<P>Neither his distress nor yet the sheer absurdity
<BR>of it was able to disarm me.&nbsp; It was the first in-
<BR>stance of harm being attempted to be done to me
<BR>--at any rate, the first I had ever found out.&nbsp; And
<BR>I was still young enough, still too much on this side
<BR>of the shadow line, not to be surprised and indig-
<BR>nant at such things.

<P>I gazed at him inflexibly.&nbsp; Let the beggar suffer.
<BR>He slapped his forehead and I passed in, pursued,
<BR>into the dining room, by his screech: "I always
<BR>said you'd be the death of me."

<P>This clamour not only overtook me, but went
<BR>ahead as it were on to the verandah and brought
<BR>out Captain Giles.

<P>He stood before me in the doorway in all the
<BR>commonplace solidity of his wisdom.&nbsp; The gold
<BR>chain glittered on his breast.&nbsp; He clutched a
<BR>smouldering pipe.

<P>I extended my hand to him warmly and he
<BR>seemed surprised, but did respond heartily enough
<BR>in the end, with a faint smile of superior knowledge
<BR>which cut my thanks short as if with a knife.&nbsp; I
<BR>don't think that more than one word came out.
<BR>And even for that one, judging by the temperature
<BR>of my face, I had blushed as if for a bad action.
<BR>Assuming a detached tone, I wondered how on
<BR>earth he had managed to spot the little underhand
<BR>game that had been going on.

<P>He murmured complacently that there were but
<BR>few things done in the town that he could not see
<BR>the inside of.&nbsp; And as to this house, he had been
<BR>using it off and on for nearly ten years.&nbsp; Nothing
<BR>that went on in it could escape his great experience.
<BR>It had been no trouble to him.&nbsp; No trouble at all.

<P>Then in his quiet, thick tone he wanted to know
<BR>if I had complained formally of the Steward's
<BR>action.

<P>I said that I hadn't--though, indeed, it was not
<BR>for want of opportunity.&nbsp; Captain Ellis had gone
<BR>for me bald-headed in a most ridiculous fashion for
<BR>being out of the way when wanted.

<P>"Funny old gentleman," interjected Captain
<BR>Giles.&nbsp; "What did you say to that?"

<P>"I said simply that I came along the very mo-
<BR>ment I heard of his message.&nbsp; Nothing more.&nbsp; I
<BR>didn't want to hurt the Steward.&nbsp; I would scorn
<BR>to harm such an object.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I made no com-
<BR>plaint, but I believe he thinks I've done so.&nbsp; Let
<BR>him think.&nbsp; He's got a fright he won't forget in a
<BR>hurry, for Captain Ellis would kick him out into
<BR>the middle of Asia. . . ."

<P>"Wait a moment," said Captain Giles, leaving
<BR>me suddenly.&nbsp; I sat down feeling very tired,
<BR>mostly in my head.&nbsp; Before I could start a train of
<BR>thought he stood again before me, murmuring the
<BR>excuse that he had to go and put the fellow's mind
<BR>at ease.

<P>I looked up with surprise.&nbsp; But in reality I was
<BR>indifferent.&nbsp; He explained that he had found the
<BR>Steward lying face downward on the horsehair sofa.
<BR>He was all right now.

<P>"He would not have died of fright," I said con-
<BR>temptuously.

<P>"No.&nbsp; But he might have taken an overdose out
<BR>of one of them little bottles he keeps in his room,"
<BR>Captain Giles argued seriously.&nbsp; "The confounded
<BR>fool has tried to poison himself once--a few years
<BR>ago."

<P>"Really," I said without emotion.&nbsp; "He doesn't
<BR>seem very fit to live, anyhow."

<P>"As to that, it may be said of a good many."

<P>"Don't exaggerate like this!" I protested,
<BR>laughing irritably.&nbsp; "But I wonder what this part
<BR>of the world would do if you were to leave off look-
<BR>ing after it, Captain Giles?&nbsp; Here you have got me
<BR>a command and saved the Steward's life in one
<BR>afternoon.&nbsp; Though why you should have taken all
<BR>that interest in either of us is more than I can
<BR>understand."

<P>Captain Giles remained silent for a minute.
<BR>Then gravely:

<P>"He's not a bad steward really.&nbsp; He can find a
<BR>good cook, at any rate.&nbsp; And, what's more, he can
<BR>keep him when found.&nbsp; I remember the cooks we
<BR>had here before his time! . . ."

<P>I must have made a movement of impatience,
<BR>because he interrupted himself with an apology for
<BR>keeping me yarning there, while no doubt I needed
<BR>all my time to get ready.

<P>What I really needed was to be alone for a bit.
<BR>I seized this opening hastily.&nbsp; My bedroom was a
<BR>quiet refuge in an apparently uninhabited wing of
<BR>the building.&nbsp; Having absolutely nothing to do
<BR>(for I had not unpacked my things), I sat down on
<BR>the bed and abandoned myself to the influences of
<BR>the hour.&nbsp; To the unexpected influences. . . .

<P>And first I wondered at my state of mind.&nbsp; Why
<BR>was I not more surprised?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Here I was, in-
<BR>vested with a command in the twinkling of an eye,
<BR>not in the common course of human affairs, but
<BR>more as if by enchantment.&nbsp; I ought to have been
<BR>lost in astonishment.&nbsp; But I wasn't.&nbsp; I was very
<BR>much like people in fairy tales.&nbsp; Nothing ever
<BR>astonishes them.&nbsp; When a fully appointed gala
<BR>coach is produced out of a pumpkin to take
<BR>her to a ball, Cinderella does not exclaim.&nbsp; She
<BR>gets in quietly and drives away to her high for-
<BR>tune.

<P>Captain Ellis (a fierce sort of fairy) had pro-
<BR>duced a command out of a drawer almost as un-
<BR>expectedly as in a fairy tale.&nbsp; But a command is an
<BR>abstract idea, and it seemed a sort of "lesser
<BR>marvel" till it flashed upon me that it involved the
<BR>concrete existence of a ship.

<P>A ship!&nbsp; My ship!&nbsp; She was mine, more abso-
<BR>lutely mine for possession and care than anything
<BR>in the world; an object of responsibility and de-
<BR>votion.&nbsp; She was there waiting for me, spell-bound,
<BR>unable to move, to live, to get out into the world
<BR>(till I came), like an enchanted princess.&nbsp; Her call
<BR>had come to me as if from the clouds.&nbsp; I had never
<BR>suspected her existence.&nbsp; I didn't know how she
<BR>looked, I had barely heard her name, and yet we
<BR>were indissolubly united for a certain portion of our
<BR>future, to sink or swim together!

<P>A sudden passion of anxious impatience rushed
<BR>through my veins, gave me such a sense of the in-
<BR>tensity of existence as I have never felt before or
<BR>since.&nbsp; I discovered how much of a seaman I was,
<BR>in heart, in mind, and, as it were, physically--a
<BR>man exclusively of sea and ships; the sea the only
<BR>world that counted, and the ships, the test of man-
<BR>liness, of temperament, of courage and fidelity--
<BR>and of love.

<P>I had an exquisite moment.&nbsp; It was unique also.
<BR>Jumping up from my seat, I paced up and down
<BR>my room for a long time.&nbsp; But when I came down-
<BR>stairs I behaved with sufficient composure.&nbsp; I
<BR>only couldn't eat anything at dinner.

<P>Having declared my intention not to drive but
<BR>to walk down to the quay, I must render the
<BR>wretched Steward justice that he bestirred himself
<BR>to find me some coolies for the luggage.&nbsp; They de-
<BR>parted, carrying all my worldly possessions (except
<BR>a little money I had in my pocket) slung from a long
<BR>pole.&nbsp; Captain Giles volunteered to walk down
<BR>with me.

<P>We followed the sombre, shaded alley across the
<BR>Esplanade.&nbsp; It was moderately cool there under
<BR>the trees.&nbsp; Captain Giles remarked, with a sudden
<BR>laugh: "I know who's jolly thankful at having seen
<BR>the last of you."

<P>I guessed that he meant the Steward.&nbsp; The fellow
<BR>had borne himself to me in a sulkily frightened
<BR>manner at the last.&nbsp; I expressed my wonder that
<BR>he should have tried to do me a bad turn for no
<BR>reason at all.

<P>"Don't you see that what he wanted was to get
<BR>rid of our friend Hamilton by dodging him in front
<BR>of you for that job?&nbsp; That would have removed
<BR>him for good.&nbsp; See?"

<P>"Heavens!" I exclaimed, feeling humiliated
<BR>somehow.&nbsp; "Can it be possible?&nbsp; What a fool he
<BR>must be!&nbsp; That overbearing, impudent loafer!
<BR>Why!&nbsp; He couldn't. . . .&nbsp; And yet he's nearly
<BR>done it, I believe; for the Harbour Office was bound
<BR>to send somebody."

<P>"Aye.&nbsp; A fool like our Steward can be dangerous
<BR>sometimes," declared Captain Giles sententiously.
<BR>"Just because he is a fool," he added, imparting
<BR>further instruction in his complacent low tones.
<BR>"For," he continued in the manner of a set demon-
<BR>stration, "no sensible person would risk being
<BR>kicked out of the only berth between himself and
<BR>starvation just to get rid of a simple annoyance--
<BR>a small worry.&nbsp; Would he now?"

<P>"Well, no," I conceded, restraining a desire to
<BR>laugh at that something mysteriously earnest in
<BR>delivering the conclusions of his wisdom as though
<BR>it were the product of prohibited operations.&nbsp; "But
<BR>that fellow looks as if he were rather crazy.&nbsp; He
<BR>must be."

<P>"As to that, I believe everybody in the world is a
<BR>little mad," he announced quietly.

<P>"You make no exceptions?" I inquired, just to
<BR>hear his manner.

<P>"Why!&nbsp; Kent says that even of you."

<P>"Does he?" I retorted, extremely embittered
<BR>all at once against my former captain.&nbsp; "There's
<BR>nothing of that in the written character from him
<BR>which I've got in my pocket.&nbsp; Has he given you
<BR>any instances of my lunacy?"

<P>Captain Giles explained in a conciliating tone
<BR>that it had been only a friendly remark in refer-
<BR>ence to my abrupt leaving the ship for no apparent
<BR>reason.

<P>I muttered grumpily: "Oh! leaving his ship,"
<BR>and mended my pace.&nbsp; He kept up by my side in
<BR>the deep gloom of the avenue as if it were his con-
<BR>scientious duty to see me out of the colony as an
<BR>undesirable character.&nbsp; He panted a little, which
<BR>was rather pathetic in a way.&nbsp; But I was not
<BR>moved.&nbsp; On the contrary.&nbsp; His discomfort gave
<BR>me a sort of malicious pleasure.

<P>Presently I relented, slowed down, and said:

<P>"What I really wanted was to get a fresh grip.
<BR>I felt it was time.&nbsp; Is that so very mad?"

<P>He made no answer.&nbsp; We were issuing from the
<BR>avenue.&nbsp; On the bridge over the canal a dark, ir-
<BR>resolute figure seemed to be awaiting something or
<BR>somebody.

<P>It was a Malay policeman, barefooted, in his
<BR>blue uniform.&nbsp; The silver band on his little round
<BR>cap shone dimly in the light of the street lamp.&nbsp; He
<BR>peered in our direction timidly.

<P>Before we could come up to him he turned about
<BR>and walked in front of us in the direction of the
<BR>jetty.&nbsp; The distance was some hundred yards; and
<BR>then I found my coolies squatting on their heels.
<BR>They had kept the pole on their shoulders, and all
<BR>my worldly goods, still tied to the pole, were resting
<BR>on the ground between them.&nbsp; As far as the eye
<BR>could reach along the quay there was not another
<BR>soul abroad except the police peon, who saluted us.

<P>It seems he had detained the coolies as suspicious
<BR>characters, and had forbidden them the jetty.&nbsp; But
<BR>at a sign from me he took off the embargo with
<BR>alacrity.&nbsp; The two patient fellows, rising together
<BR>with a faint grunt, trotted off along the planks, and
<BR>I prepared to take my leave of Captain Giles, who
<BR>stood there with an air as though his mission were
<BR>drawing to a close.&nbsp; It could not be denied that he
<BR>had done it all.&nbsp; And while I hesitated about an
<BR>appropriate sentence he made himself heard:

<P>"I expect you'll have your hands pretty full of
<BR>tangled-up business."

<P>I asked him what made him think so; and he an-
<BR>swered that it was his general experience of the
<BR>world.&nbsp; Ship a long time away from her port,
<BR>owners inaccessible by cable, and the only man who
<BR>could explain matters dead and buried.

<P>"And you yourself new to the business in a way,"
<BR>he concluded in a sort of unanswerable tone.

<P>"Don't insist," I said.&nbsp; "I know it only too well.
<BR>I only wish you could impart to me some small
<BR>portion of your experience before I go.&nbsp; As it can't
<BR>be done in ten minutes I had better not begin to ask
<BR>you.&nbsp; There's that harbour launch waiting for me,
<BR>too.&nbsp; But I won't feel really at peace till I have that
<BR>ship of mine out in the Indian Ocean."

<P>He remarked casually that from Bangkok to the
<BR>Indian Ocean was a pretty long step.&nbsp; And this
<BR>murmur, like a dim flash from a dark lantern,
<BR>showed me for a moment the broad belt of islands
<BR>and reefs between that unknown ship, which was
<BR>mine, and the freedom of the great waters of the
<BR>globe.

<P>But I felt no apprehension.&nbsp; I was familiar
<BR>enough with the Archipelago by that time.&nbsp; Ex-
<BR>treme patience and extreme care would see me
<BR>through the region of broken land, of faint airs, and
<BR>of dead water to where I would feel at last my
<BR>command swing on the great swell and list over to
<BR>the great breath of regular winds, that would give
<BR>her the feeling of a large, more intense life.&nbsp; The
<BR>road would be long.&nbsp; All roads are long that lead
<BR>toward one's heart's desire.&nbsp; But this road my
<BR>mind's eye could see on a chart, professionally,
<BR>with all its complications and difficulties, yet simple
<BR>enough in a way.&nbsp; One is a seaman or one is not.
<BR>And I had no doubt of being one.

<P>The only part I was a stranger to was the Gulf of
<BR>Siam.&nbsp; And I mentioned this to Captain Giles.
<BR>Not that I was concerned very much.&nbsp; It belonged
<BR>to the same region the nature of which I knew, into
<BR>whose very soul I seemed to have looked during the
<BR>last months of that existence with which I had
<BR>broken now, suddenly, as one parts with some en-
<BR>chanting company.

<P>"The gulf . . . Ay!&nbsp; A funny piece of
<BR>water--that," said Captain Giles.

<P>Funny, in this connection, was a vague word.
<BR>The whole thing sounded like an opinion uttered
<BR>by a cautious person mindful of actions for slander.

<P>I didn't inquire as to the nature of that funni-
<BR>ness.&nbsp; There was really no time.&nbsp; But at the very
<BR>last he volunteered a warning.

<P>"Whatever you do keep to the east side of it.
<BR>The west side is dangerous at this time of the year.
<BR>Don't let anything tempt you over.&nbsp; You'll find
<BR>nothing but trouble there."

<P>Though I could hardly imagine what could tempt
<BR>me to involve my ship amongst the currents and
<BR>reefs of the Malay shore, I thanked him for the
<BR>advice.

<P>He gripped my extended arm warmly, and the
<BR>end of our acquaintance came suddenly in the
<BR>words: "Good-night."

<P>That was all he said: "Good-night."&nbsp; Nothing
<BR>more.&nbsp; I don't know what I intended to say, but
<BR>surprise made me swallow it, whatever it was.&nbsp; I
<BR>choked slightly, and then exclaimed with a sort of
<BR>nervous haste: "Oh!&nbsp; Good-night, Captain Giles,
<BR>good-night."

<P>His movements were always deliberate, but his
<BR>back had receded some distance along the deserted
<BR>quay before I collected myself enough to follow his
<BR>example and made a half turn in the direction of
<BR>the jetty.

<P>Only my movements were not deliberate.&nbsp; I
<BR>hurried down to the steps, and leaped into the
<BR>launch.&nbsp; Before I had fairly landed in her stern-
<BR>sheets the slim little craft darted away from the
<BR>jetty with a sudden swirl of her propeller and the
<BR>hard, rapid puffing of the exhaust in her vaguely
<BR>gleaming brass funnel amidships.

<P>The misty churning at her stern was the only
<BR>sound in the world.&nbsp; The shore lay plunged in the
<BR>silence of the deeper slumber.&nbsp; I watched the town
<BR>recede still and soundless in the hot night, till the
<BR>abrupt hail, "Steam-launch, ahoy!" made me spin
<BR>round face forward.&nbsp; We were close to a white
<BR>ghostly steamer.&nbsp; Lights shone on her decks, in her
<BR>portholes.&nbsp; And the same voice shouted from her:

<P>"Is that our passenger?"

<P>"It is," I yelled.

<P>Her crew had been obviously on the jump.&nbsp; I
<BR>could hear them running about.&nbsp; The modern
<BR>spirit of haste was loudly vocal in the orders to
<BR>"Heave away on the cable"--to "Lower the side-
<BR>ladder," and in urgent requests to me to "Come
<BR>along, sir!&nbsp; We have been delayed three hours for
<BR>you. . . .&nbsp; Our time is seven o'clock, you know!"

<P>I stepped on the deck.&nbsp; I said "No!&nbsp; I don't
<BR>know."&nbsp; The spirit of modern hurry was embodied
<BR>in a thin, long-armed, long-legged man, with a
<BR>closely clipped gray beard.&nbsp; His meagre hand was
<BR>hot and dry.&nbsp; He declared feverishly:

<P>"I am hanged if I would have waited another
<BR>five minutes Harbour-Master or no Harbour-
<BR>Master."

<P>"That's your own business," I said.&nbsp; "I didn't
<BR>ask you to wait for me."

<P>"I hope you don't expect any supper," he burst
<BR>out.&nbsp; "This isn't a boarding-house afloat.&nbsp; You are
<BR>the first passenger I ever had in my life and I hope
<BR>to goodness you will be the last."

<P>I made no answer to this hospitable communi-
<BR>cation; and, indeed, he didn't wait for any, bolting
<BR>away on to his bridge to get his ship under way.

<P>For the three days he had me on board he did not
<BR>depart from that half-hostile attitude.&nbsp; His ship
<BR>having been delayed three hours on my account he
<BR>couldn't forgive me for not being a more distin-
<BR>guished person.&nbsp; He was not exactly outspoken
<BR>about it, but that feeling of annoyed wonder was
<BR>peeping out perpetually in his talk.

<P>He was absurd.

<P>He was also a man of much experience, which he
<BR>liked to trot out; but no greater contrast with Cap-
<BR>tain Giles could have been imagined.&nbsp; He would
<BR>have amused me if I had wanted to be amused.
<BR>But I did not want to be amused.&nbsp; I was like a
<BR>lover looking forward to a meeting.&nbsp; Human hos-
<BR>tility was nothing to me.&nbsp; I thought of my un-
<BR>known ship.&nbsp; It was amusement enough, torment
<BR>enough, occupation enough.

<P>He perceived my state, for his wits were suffi-
<BR>ciently sharp for that, and he poked sly fun at my
<BR>preoccupation in the manner some nasty, cynical
<BR>old men assume toward the dreams and illusions of
<BR>youth.&nbsp; I, on my side, refrained from questioning
<BR>him as to the appearance of my ship, though I
<BR>knew that being in Bangkok every fortnight or so he
<BR>must have known her by sight.&nbsp; I was not going to
<BR>expose the ship, my ship! to some slighting
<BR>reference.

<P>He was the first really unsympathetic man I had
<BR>ever come in contact with.&nbsp; My education was far
<BR>from being finished, though I didn't know it.&nbsp; No!
<BR>I didn't know it.

<P>All I knew was that he disliked me and had some
<BR>contempt for my person.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Apparently
<BR>because his ship had been delayed three hours on
<BR>my account.&nbsp; Who was I to have such a thing done
<BR>for me?&nbsp; Such a thing had never been done for him.
<BR>It was a sort of jealous indignation.

<P>My expectation, mingled with fear, was wrought
<BR>to its highest pitch.&nbsp; How slow had been the days
<BR>of the passage and how soon they were over.&nbsp; One
<BR>morning, early, we crossed the bar, and while the
<BR>sun was rising splendidly over the flat spaces of the
<BR>land we steamed up the innumerable bends, passed
<BR>under the shadow of the great gilt pagoda, and
<BR>reached the outskirts of the town.

<P>There it was, spread largely on both banks, the
<BR>Oriental capital which had as yet suffered no white
<BR>conqueror; an expanse of brown houses of bamboo,
<BR>of mats, of leaves, of a vegetable-matter style of
<BR>architecture, sprung out of the brown soil on the
<BR>banks of the muddy river.&nbsp; It was amazing to think
<BR>that in those miles of human habitations there was
<BR>not probably half a dozen pounds of nails.&nbsp; Some
<BR>of those houses of sticks and grass, like the nests of
<BR>an aquatic race, clung to the low shores.&nbsp; Others
<BR>seemed to grow out of the water; others again
<BR>floated in long anchored rows in the very middle of
<BR>the stream.&nbsp; Here and there in the distance, above
<BR>the crowded mob of low, brown roof ridges, towered
<BR>great piles of masonry, King's Palace, temples,
<BR>gorgeous and dilapidated, crumbling under the
<BR>vertical sunlight, tremendous, overpowering, al-
<BR>most palpable, which seemed to enter one's breast
<BR>with the breath of one's nostrils and soak into one's
<BR>limbs through every pore of one's skin.

<P>The ridiculous victim of jealousy had for some
<BR>reason or other to stop his engines just then.&nbsp; The
<BR>steamer drifted slowly up with the tide.&nbsp; Oblivious
<BR>of my new surroundings I walked the deck, in anx-
<BR>ious, deadened abstraction, a commingling of
<BR>romantic reverie with a very practical survey of
<BR>my qualifications.&nbsp; For the time was approaching
<BR>for me to behold my command and to prove my
<BR>worth in the ultimate test of my profession.

<P>Suddenly I heard myself called by that imbe-
<BR>cile.&nbsp; He was beckoning me to come up on his
<BR>bridge.

<P>I didn't care very much for that, but as it
<BR>seemed that he had something particular to say I
<BR>went up the ladder.

<P>He laid his hand on my shoulder and gave me a slight turn,
<BR>pointing with his other arm at the same time.

<P>"There!&nbsp; That's your ship, Captain," he said.

<P>I felt a thump in my breast--only one, as if my
<BR>heart had then ceased to beat.&nbsp; There were ten or
<BR>more ships moored along the bank, and the one
<BR>he meant was partly hidden away from my sight by her
<BR>next astern.&nbsp; He said: "We'll drift abreast her in
<BR>a moment."

<P>What was his tone?&nbsp; Mocking?&nbsp; Threatening?
<BR>Or only indifferent?&nbsp; I could not tell.&nbsp; I suspected
<BR>some malice in this unexpected manifestation of
<BR>interest.

<P>He left me, and I leaned over the rail of the
<BR>bridge looking over the side.&nbsp; I dared not raise my
<BR>eyes.&nbsp; Yet it had to be done--and, indeed, I could
<BR>not have helped myself.&nbsp; I believe I trembled.

<P>But directly my eyes had rested on my ship all
<BR>my fear vanished.&nbsp; It went off swiftly, like a bad
<BR>dream.&nbsp; Only that a dream leaves no shame be-
<BR>hind it, and that I felt a momentary shame at my
<BR>unworthy suspicions.

<P>Yes, there she was.&nbsp; Her hull, her rigging filled
<BR>my eye with a great content.&nbsp; That feeling of life-
<BR>emptiness which had made me so restless for the
<BR>last few months lost its bitter plausibility, its evil
<BR>influence, dissolved in a flow of joyous emotion.

<P>At first glance I saw that she was a high-class
<BR>vessel, a harmonious creature in the lines of her
<BR>fine body, in the proportioned tallness of her spars.
<BR>Whatever her age and her history, she had pre-
<BR>served the stamp of her origin.&nbsp; She was one of
<BR>those craft that, in virtue of their design and com-
<BR>plete finish, will never look old.&nbsp; Amongst her com-
<BR>panions moored to the bank, and all bigger than
<BR>herself, she looked like a creature of high breed--
<BR>an Arab steed in a string of cart-horses.

<P>A voice behind me said in a nasty equivocal tone:
<BR>"I hope you are satisfied with her, Captain."&nbsp; I
<BR>did not even turn my head.&nbsp; It was the master of
<BR>the steamer, and whatever he meant, whatever he
<BR>thought of her, I knew that, like some rare women,
<BR>she was one of those creatures whose mere existence
<BR>is enough to awaken an unselfish delight.&nbsp; One
<BR>feels that it is good to be in the world in which she
<BR>has her being.

<P>That illusion of life and character which charms
<BR>one in men's finest handiwork radiated from her.
<BR>An enormous bulk of teak-wood timber swung over
<BR>her hatchway; lifeless matter, looking heavier and
<BR>bigger than anything aboard of her.&nbsp; When they
<BR>started lowering it the surge of the tackle sent a
<BR>quiver through her from water-line to the trucks up
<BR>the fine nerves of her rigging, as though she had
<BR>shuddered at the weight.&nbsp; It seemed cruel to load
<BR>her so. . . .

<P>Half an hour later, putting my foot on her deck
<BR>for the first time, I received the feeling of deep
<BR>physical satisfaction.&nbsp; Nothing could equal the
<BR>fullness of that moment, the ideal completeness of
<BR>that emotional experience which had come to me
<BR>without the preliminary toil and disenchantments
<BR>of an obscure career.

<P>My rapid glance ran over her, enveloped, ap-
<BR>propriated the form concreting the abstract senti-
<BR>ment of my command.&nbsp; A lot of details perceptible
<BR>to a seaman struck my eye, vividly in that instant.
<BR>For the rest, I saw her disengaged from the material
<BR>conditions of her being.&nbsp; The shore to which she
<BR>was moored was as if it did not exist.&nbsp; What were
<BR>to me all the countries of the globe?&nbsp; In all the
<BR>parts of the world washed by navigable waters our
<BR>relation to each other would be the same--and
<BR>more intimate than there are words to express in
<BR>the language.&nbsp; Apart from that, every scene and
<BR>episode would be a mere passing show.&nbsp; The very
<BR>gang of yellow coolies busy about the main hatch
<BR>was less substantial than the stuff dreams are made
<BR>of.&nbsp; For who on earth would dream of Chinamen? . . .

<P>I went aft, ascended the poop, where, under the
<BR>awning, gleamed the brasses of the yacht-like
<BR>fittings, the polished surfaces of the rails, the glass
<BR>of the skylights.&nbsp; Right aft two seamen, busy
<BR>cleaning the steering gear, with the reflected ripples
<BR>of light running playfully up their bent backs, went
<BR>on with their work, unaware of me and of the al-
<BR>most affectionate glance I threw at them in passing
<BR>toward the companion-way of the cabin.

<P>The doors stood wide open, the slide was pushed
<BR>right back.&nbsp; The half-turn of the staircase cut off
<BR>the view of the lobby.&nbsp; A low humming ascended
<BR>from below, but it stopped abruptly at the sound of
<BR>my descending footsteps.
