<P>THE first thing I saw down there was the upper part
<BR>of a man's body projecting backward, as it were,
<BR>from one of the doors at the foot of the stairs.&nbsp; His
<BR>eyes looked at me very wide and still.&nbsp; In one hand
<BR>he held a dinner plate, in the other a cloth.

<P>"I am your new Captain," I said quietly.

<P>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, he had
<BR>got rid of the plate and the cloth and jumped to
<BR>open the cabin door.&nbsp; As soon as I passed into the
<BR>saloon he vanished, but only to reappear instantly,
<BR>buttoning up a jacket he had put on with the
<BR>swiftness of a "quick-change" artist.

<P>"Where's the chief mate?" I asked.

<P>"In the hold, I think, sir.&nbsp; I saw him go down
<BR>the after-hatch ten minutes ago."

<P>"Tell him I am on board."

<P>The mahogany table under the skylight shone in
<BR>the twilight like a dark pool of water.&nbsp; The side-
<BR>board, surmounted by a wide looking-glass in an
<BR>ormulu frame, had a marble top.&nbsp; It bore a pair of
<BR>silver-plated lamps and some other pieces--
<BR>obviously a harbour display.&nbsp; The saloon itself
<BR>was panelled in two kinds of wood in the excellent
<BR>simple taste prevailing when the ship was built.

<P>I sat down in the armchair at the head of the
<BR>table--the captain's chair, with a small tell-tale
<BR>compass swung above it--a mute reminder of un-
<BR>remitting vigilance.

<P>A succession of men had sat in that chair.&nbsp; I be-
<BR>came aware of that thought suddenly, vividly, as
<BR>though each had left a little of himself between the
<BR>four walls of these ornate bulkheads; as if a sort of
<BR>composite soul, the soul of command, had whispered
<BR>suddenly to mine of long days at sea and of anxious
<BR>moments.

<P>"You, too!" it seemed to say, "you, too, shall
<BR>taste of that peace and that unrest in a searching
<BR>intimacy with your own self--obscure as we were
<BR>and as supreme in the face of all the winds and all
<BR>the seas, in an immensity that receives no impress,
<BR>preserves no memories, and keeps no reckoning of
<BR>lives."

<P>Deep within the tarnished ormulu frame, in the
<BR>hot half-light sifted through the awning, I saw my
<BR>own face propped between my hands.&nbsp; And I
<BR>stared back at myself with the perfect detachment
<BR>of distance, rather with curiosity than with any
<BR>other feeling, except of some sympathy for this
<BR>latest representative of what for all intents and
<BR>purposes was a dynasty, continuous not in blood
<BR>indeed, but in its experience, in its training, in its
<BR>conception of duty, and in the blessed simplicity of
<BR>its traditional point of view on life.

<P>It struck me that this quietly staring man whom
<BR>I was watching, both as if he were myself and some-
<BR>body else, was not exactly a lonely figure.&nbsp; He had
<BR>his place in a line of men whom he did not know, of
<BR>whom he had never heard; but who were fashioned
<BR>by the same influences, whose souls in relation to
<BR>their humble life's work had no secrets for him.

<P>Suddenly I perceived that there was another man
<BR>in the saloon, standing a little on one side and look-
<BR>ing intently at me.&nbsp; The chief mate.&nbsp; His long,
<BR>red moustache determined the character of his
<BR>physiognomy, which struck me as pugnacious in
<BR>(strange to say) a ghastly sort of way.

<P>How long had he been there looking at me, ap-
<BR>praising me in my unguarded day-dreaming state?
<BR>I would have been more disconcerted if, having the
<BR>clock set in the top of the mirror-frame right in
<BR>front of me, I had not noticed that its long hand
<BR>had hardly moved at all.

<P>I could not have been in that cabin more than
<BR>two minutes altogether.&nbsp; Say three. . . .&nbsp; So
<BR>he could not have been watching me more than a
<BR>mere fraction of a minute, luckily.&nbsp; Still, I re-
<BR>gretted the occurrence.

<P>But I showed nothing of it as I rose leisurely (it
<BR>had to be leisurely) and greeted him with perfect
<BR>friendliness.

<P>There was something reluctant and at the same
<BR>time attentive in his bearing.&nbsp; His name was
<BR>Burns.&nbsp; We left the cabin and went round the ship
<BR>together.&nbsp; His face in the full light of day ap-
<BR>peared very pale, meagre, even haggard.&nbsp; Some-
<BR>how I had a delicacy as to looking too often at him;
<BR>his eyes, on the contrary, remained fairly glued on
<BR>my face.&nbsp; They were greenish and had an ex-
<BR>pectant expression.

<P>He answered all my questions readily enough,
<BR>but my ear seemed to catch a tone of unwillingness.
<BR>The second officer, with three or four hands, was
<BR>busy forward.&nbsp; The mate mentioned his name and
<BR>I nodded to him in passing.&nbsp; He was very young.
<BR>He struck me as rather a cub.

<P>When we returned below, I sat down on one end
<BR>of a deep, semi-circular, or, rather, semi-oval settee,
<BR>upholstered in red plush.&nbsp; It extended right across
<BR>the whole after-end of the cabin.&nbsp; Mr. Burns
<BR>motioned to sit down, dropped into one of the
<BR>swivel-chairs round the table, and kept his eyes on
<BR>me as persistently as ever, and with that strange air
<BR>as if all this were make-believe and he expected me
<BR>to get up, burst into a laugh, slap him on the back,
<BR>and vanish from the cabin.

<P>There was an odd stress in the situation which
<BR>began to make me uncomfortable.&nbsp; I tried to react
<BR>against this vague feeling.

<P>"It's only my inexperience," I thought.

<P>In the face of that man, several years, I judged,
<BR>older than myself, I became aware of what I had
<BR>left already behind me--my youth.&nbsp; And that was
<BR>indeed poor comfort.&nbsp; Youth is a fine thing, a
<BR>mighty power--as long as one does not think of
<BR>it.&nbsp; I felt I was becoming self-conscious.&nbsp; Almost
<BR>against my will I assumed a moody gravity.&nbsp; I
<BR>said: "I see you have kept her in very good order,
<BR>Mr. Burns."

<P>Directly I had uttered these words I asked my-
<BR>self angrily why the deuce did I want to say that?
<BR>Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me.&nbsp; What
<BR>on earth did he mean?

<P>I fell back on a question which had been in my
<BR>thoughts for a long time--the most natural ques-
<BR>tion on the lips of any seaman whatever joining a
<BR>ship.&nbsp; I voiced it (confound this self-consciousness)
<BR>in a degage cheerful tone: "I suppose she can travel
<BR>--what?"

<P>Now a question like this might have been an-
<BR>swered normally, either in accents of apologetic
<BR>sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride, in a "I
<BR>don't want to boast, but you shall see," sort of
<BR>tone.&nbsp; There are sailors, too, who would have been
<BR>roughly outspoken: "Lazy brute," or openly de-
<BR>lighted: "She's a flyer."&nbsp; Two ways, if four
<BR>manners.

<P>But Mr. Burns found another way, a way of his
<BR>own which had, at all events, the merit of saving
<BR>his breath, if no other.

<P>Again he did not say anything.&nbsp; He only
<BR>frowned.&nbsp; And it was an angry frown.&nbsp; I waited.
<BR>Nothing more came.

<P>"What's the matter? . . .&nbsp; Can't you tell
<BR>after being nearly two years in the ship?"&nbsp; I ad-
<BR>dressed him sharply.

<P>He looked as startled for a moment as though he
<BR>had discovered my presence only that very mo-
<BR>ment.&nbsp; But this passed off almost at once.&nbsp; He
<BR>put on an air of indifference.&nbsp; But I suppose he
<BR>thought it better to say something.&nbsp; He said that a
<BR>ship needed, just like a man, the chance to show the
<BR>best she could do, and that this ship had never had
<BR>a chance since he had been on board of her.&nbsp; Not
<BR>that he could remember.&nbsp; The last captain. . . .
<BR>He paused.

<P>"Has he been so very unlucky?" I asked with
<BR>frank incredulity.&nbsp; Mr. Burns turned his eyes away
<BR>from me.&nbsp; No, the late captain was not an unlucky
<BR>man.&nbsp; One couldn't say that.&nbsp; But he had not
<BR>seemed to want to make use of his luck.

<P>Mr. Burns--man of enigmatic moods--made
<BR>this statement with an inanimate face and staring
<BR>wilfully at the rudder casing.&nbsp; The statement itself
<BR>was obscurely suggestive.&nbsp; I asked quietly:

<P>"Where did he die?"

<P>"In this saloon.&nbsp; Just where you are sitting
<BR>now," answered Mr. Burns.

<P>I repressed a silly impulse to jump up; but upon
<BR>the whole I was relieved to hear that he had not
<BR>died in the bed which was now to be mine.&nbsp; I
<BR>pointed out to the chief mate that what I really
<BR>wanted to know was where he had buried his late
<BR>captain.

<P>Mr. Burns said that it was at the entrance to the
<BR>gulf.&nbsp; A roomy grave; a sufficient answer.&nbsp; But
<BR>the mate, overcoming visibly something within him
<BR>--something like a curious reluctance to believe in
<BR>my advent (as an irrevocable fact, at any rate), did
<BR>not stop at that--though, indeed, he may have
<BR>wished to do so.

<P>As a compromise with his feelings, I believe, he
<BR>addressed himself persistently to the rudder-casing,
<BR>so that to me he had the appearance of a man
<BR>talking in solitude, a little unconsciously, however.

<P>His tale was that at seven bells in the forenoon
<BR>watch he had all hands mustered on the quarter-
<BR>deck and told them they had better go down to say
<BR>good-bye to the captain.

<P>Those words, as if grudged to an intruding per-
<BR>sonage, were enough for me to evoke vividly that
<BR>strange ceremony: The bare-footed, bare-headed
<BR>seamen crowding shyly into that cabin, a small
<BR>mob pressed against that sideboard, uncomfortable
<BR>rather than moved, shirts open on sunburnt chests,
<BR>weather-beaten faces, and all staring at the dying
<BR>man with the same grave and expectant expression.

<P>"Was he conscious?" I asked.

<P>"He didn't speak, but he moved his eyes to look
<BR>at them," said the mate.

<P>After waiting a moment, Mr. Burns motioned
<BR>the crew to leave the cabin, but he detained the two
<BR>eldest men to stay with the captain while he went
<BR>on deck with his sextant to "take the sun."&nbsp; It
<BR>was getting toward noon and he was anxious to
<BR>obtain a good observation for latitude.&nbsp; When he
<BR>returned below to put his sextant away he found
<BR>that the two men had retreated out into the lobby.
<BR>Through the open door he had a view of the captain
<BR>lying easy against the pillows.&nbsp; He had "passed
<BR>away" while Mr. Burns was taking this observa-
<BR>tion.&nbsp; As near noon as possible.&nbsp; He had hardly
<BR>changed his position.

<P>Mr. Burns sighed, glanced at me inquisitively,
<BR>as much as to say, "Aren't you going yet?" and then
<BR>turned his thoughts from his new captain back to
<BR>the old, who, being dead, had no authority, was not
<BR>in anybody's way, and was much easier to deal with.

<P>Mr. Burns dealt with him at some length.&nbsp; He
<BR>was a peculiar man--of sixty-five about--iron gray,
<BR>hard-faced, obstinate, and uncommunicative.&nbsp; He
<BR>used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable
<BR>reasons.&nbsp; Would come on deck at night sometimes,
<BR>take some sail off her, God only knows why or
<BR>wherefore, then go below, shut himself up in his
<BR>cabin, and play on the violin for hours--till day-
<BR>break perhaps.&nbsp; In fact, he spent most of his time
<BR>day or night playing the violin.&nbsp; That was when
<BR>the fit took him.&nbsp; Very loud, too.

<P>It came to this, that Mr. Burns mustered his
<BR>courage one day and remonstrated earnestly with
<BR>the captain.&nbsp; Neither he nor the second mate
<BR>could get a wink of sleep in their watches below for
<BR>the noise. . . .&nbsp; And how could they be ex-
<BR>pected to keep awake while on duty?&nbsp; He pleaded.
<BR>The answer of that stern man was that if he and the
<BR>second mate didn't like the noise, they were wel-
<BR>come to pack up their traps and walk over the side.
<BR>When this alternative was offered the ship hap-
<BR>pened to be 600 miles from the nearest land.

<P>Mr. Burns at this point looked at me with an air
<BR>of curiosity.&nbsp; I began to think that my predecessor
<BR>was a remarkably peculiar old man.

<P>But I had to hear stranger things yet.&nbsp; It came
<BR>out that this stern, grim, wind-tanned, rough, sea-
<BR>salted, taciturn sailor of sixty-five was not only an
<BR>artist, but a lover as well.&nbsp; In Haiphong, when
<BR>they got there after a course of most unprofitable
<BR>peregrinations (during which the ship was nearly
<BR>lost twice), he got himself, in Mr. Burns' own
<BR>words, "mixed up" with some woman.&nbsp; Mr. Burns
<BR>had had no personal knowledge of that affair, but
<BR>positive evidence of it existed in the shape of a
<BR>photograph taken in Haiphong.&nbsp; Mr. Burns found
<BR>it in one of the drawers in the captain's room.

<P>In due course I, too, saw that amazing human
<BR>document (I even threw it overboard later).
<BR>There he sat, with his hands reposing on his knees,
<BR>bald, squat, gray, bristly, recalling a wild boar
<BR>somehow; and by his side towered an awful mature,
<BR>white female with rapacious nostrils and a cheaply
<BR>ill-omened stare in her enormous eyes.&nbsp; She was
<BR>disguised in some semi-oriental, vulgar, fancy
<BR>costume.&nbsp; She resembled a low-class medium or
<BR>one of those women who tell fortunes by cards for
<BR>half a crown.&nbsp; And yet she was striking.&nbsp; A pro-
<BR>fessional sorceress from the slums.&nbsp; It was incom-
<BR>prehensible.&nbsp; There was something awful in the
<BR>thought that she was the last reflection of the world
<BR>of passion for the fierce soul which seemed to look
<BR>at one out of the sardonically savage face of that old
<BR>seaman.&nbsp; However, I noticed that she was holding
<BR>some musical instrument--guitar or mandoline--
<BR>in her hand.&nbsp; Perhaps that was the secret of her
<BR>sortilege.

<P>For Mr. Burns that photograph explained why
<BR>the unloaded ship had kept sweltering at anchor
<BR>for three weeks in a pestilential hot harbour with-
<BR>out air.&nbsp; They lay there and gasped.&nbsp; The cap-
<BR>tain, appearing now and then on short visits,
<BR>mumbled to Mr. Burns unlikely tales about some
<BR>letters he was waiting for.

<P>Suddenly, after vanishing for a week, he came on
<BR>board in the middle of the night and took the ship
<BR>out to sea with the first break of dawn.&nbsp; Daylight
<BR>showed him looking wild and ill.&nbsp; The mere getting
<BR>clear of the land took two days, and somehow or
<BR>other they bumped slightly on a reef.&nbsp; However,
<BR>no leak developed, and the captain, growling "no
<BR>matter," informed Mr. Burns that he had made up
<BR>his mind to take the ship to Hong-Kong and dry-
<BR>dock her there.

<P>At this Mr. Burns was plunged into despair.&nbsp; For
<BR>indeed, to beat up to Hong-Kong against a fierce
<BR>monsoon, with a ship not sufficiently ballasted and
<BR>with her supply of water not completed, was an in-
<BR>sane project.

<P>But the captain growled peremptorily, "Stick
<BR>her at it," and Mr. Burns, dismayed and enraged,
<BR>stuck her at it, and kept her at it, blowing away
<BR>sails, straining the spars, exhausting the crew--
<BR>nearly maddened by the absolute conviction that
<BR>the attempt was impossible and was bound to end
<BR>in some catastrophe.

<P>Meantime the captain, shut up in his cabin and
<BR>wedged in a corner of his settee against the crazy
<BR>bounding of the ship, played the violin--or, at any
<BR>rate, made continuous noise on it.

<P>When he appeared on deck he would not speak
<BR>and not always answer when spoken to.&nbsp; It was
<BR>obvious that he was ill in some mysterious manner,
<BR>and beginning to break up.

<P>As the days went by the sounds of the violin be-
<BR>came less and less loud, till at last only a feeble
<BR>scratching would meet Mr. Burns' ear as he stood
<BR>in the saloon listening outside the door of the cap-
<BR>tain's state-room.

<P>One afternoon in perfect desperation he burst
<BR>into that room and made such a scene, tearing his
<BR>hair and shouting such horrid imprecations that he
<BR>cowed the contemptuous spirit of the sick man.
<BR>The water-tanks were low, they had not gained fifty
<BR>miles in a fortnight.&nbsp; She would never reach Hong-
<BR>Kong.

<P>It was like fighting desperately toward destruc-
<BR>tion for the ship and the men.&nbsp; This was evident
<BR>without argument.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, losing all restraint,
<BR>put his face close to his captain's and fairly
<BR>yelled: "You, sir, are going out of the world.&nbsp; But
<BR>I can't wait till you are dead before I put the helm
<BR>up.&nbsp; You must do it yourself.&nbsp; You must do it
<BR>now!"

<P>The man on the couch snarled in contempt.
<BR>"So I am going out of the world--am I?"

<P>"Yes, sir--you haven't many days left in it,"
<BR>said Mr. Burns calming down.&nbsp; "One can see it by
<BR>your face."

<P>"My face, eh? . . .&nbsp; Well, put up the helm
<BR>and be damned to you."

<P>Burns flew on deck, got the ship before the wind,
<BR>then came down again composed, but resolute.

<P>"I've shaped a course for Pulo Condor, sir," he
<BR>said.&nbsp; "When we make it, if you are still with us,
<BR>you'll tell me into what port you wish me to take
<BR>the ship and I'll do it."

<P>The old man gave him a look of savage spite,
<BR>and said those atrocious words in deadly, slow
<BR>tones.

<P>"If I had my wish, neither the ship nor any of
<BR>you would ever reach a port.&nbsp; And I hope you
<BR>won't."

<P>Mr. Burns was profoundly shocked.&nbsp; I believe
<BR>he was positively frightened at the time.&nbsp; It seems,
<BR>however, that he managed to produce such an
<BR>effective laugh that it was the old man's turn to be
<BR>frightened.&nbsp; He shrank within himself and turned
<BR>his back on him.

<P>"And his head was not gone then," Mr. Burns
<BR>assured me excitedly.&nbsp; "He meant every word of it."

<P>"Such was practically the late captain's last
<BR>speech.&nbsp; No connected sentence passed his lips
<BR>afterward.&nbsp; That night he used the last of his
<BR>strength to throw his fiddle over the side.&nbsp; No one
<BR>had actually seen him in the act, but after his
<BR>death Mr. Burns couldn't find the thing anywhere.
<BR>The empty case was very much in evidence, but
<BR>the fiddle was clearly not in the ship.&nbsp; And where
<BR>else could it have gone to but overboard?"

<P>"Threw his violin overboard!" I exclaimed.

<P>"He did," cried Mr. Burns excitedly.&nbsp; "And
<BR>it's my belief he would have tried to take the ship
<BR>down with him if it had been in human power.&nbsp; He
<BR>never meant her to see home again.&nbsp; He wouldn't
<BR>write to his owners, he never wrote to his old wife,
<BR>either--he wasn't going to.&nbsp; He had made up his
<BR>mind to cut adrift from everything.&nbsp; That's what
<BR>it was.&nbsp; He didn't care for business, or freights, or
<BR>for making a passage--or anything.&nbsp; He meant to
<BR>have gone wandering about the world till he lost her
<BR>with all hands."

<P>Mr. Burns looked like a man who had escaped
<BR>great danger.&nbsp; For a little he would have ex-
<BR>claimed: "If it hadn't been for me!"&nbsp; And the
<BR>transparent innocence of his indignant eyes was
<BR>underlined quaintly by the arrogant pair of
<BR>moustaches which he proceeded to twist, and as if
<BR>extend, horizontally.

<P>I might have smiled if I had not been busy with
<BR>my own sensations, which were not those of Mr.
<BR>Burns.&nbsp; I was already the man in command.&nbsp; My
<BR>sensations could not be like those of any other man
<BR>on board.&nbsp; In that community I stood, like a king
<BR>in his country, in a class all by myself.&nbsp; I mean an
<BR>hereditary king, not a mere elected head of a state.
<BR>I was brought there to rule by an agency as remote
<BR>from the people and as inscrutable almost to them
<BR>as the Grace of God.

<P>And like a member of a dynasty, feeling a semi-
<BR>mystical bond with the dead, I was profoundly
<BR>shocked by my immediate predecessor.

<P>That man had been in all essentials but his age
<BR>just such another man as myself.&nbsp; Yet the end of
<BR>his life was a complete act of treason, the betrayal
<BR>of a tradition which seemed to me as imperative as
<BR>any guide on earth could be.&nbsp; It appeared that
<BR>even at sea a man could become the victim of evil
<BR>spirits.&nbsp; I felt on my face the breath of unknown
<BR>powers that shape our destinies.

<P>Not to let the silence last too long I asked Mr.
<BR>Burns if he had written to his captain's wife.&nbsp; He
<BR>shook his head.&nbsp; He had written to nobody.

<P>In a moment he became sombre.&nbsp; He never
<BR>thought of writing.&nbsp; It took him all his time to
<BR>watch incessantly the loading of the ship by a
<BR>rascally Chinese stevedore.&nbsp; In this Mr. Burns
<BR>gave me the first glimpse of the real chief mate's
<BR>soul which dwelt uneasily in his body.

<P>He mused, then hastened on with gloomy
<BR>force.

<P>"Yes!&nbsp; The captain died as near noon as pos-
<BR>sible.&nbsp; I looked through his papers in the afternoon.
<BR>I read the service over him at sunset and then I
<BR>stuck the ship's head north and brought her in
<BR>here.&nbsp; I--brought--her--in."

<P>He struck the table with his fist.

<P>"She would hardly have come in by herself," I
<BR>observed.&nbsp; "But why didn't you make for Singa-
<BR>pore instead?"

<P>His eyes wavered.&nbsp; "The nearest port," he
<BR>muttered sullenly.

<P>I had framed the question in perfect innocence,
<BR>but his answer (the difference in distance was in-
<BR>significant) and his manner offered me a clue to the
<BR>simple truth.&nbsp; He took the ship to a port where he
<BR>expected to be confirmed in his temporary com-
<BR>mand from lack of a qualified master to put over his
<BR>head.&nbsp; Whereas Singapore, he surmised justly,
<BR>would be full of qualified men.&nbsp; But his naive
<BR>reasoning forgot to take into account the telegraph
<BR>cable reposing on the bottom of the very Gulf up
<BR>which he had turned that ship which he imagined
<BR>himself to have saved from destruction.&nbsp; Hence
<BR>the bitter flavour of our interview.&nbsp; I tasted it
<BR>more and more distinctly--and it was less and less
<BR>to my taste.

<P>"Look here, Mr. Burns," I began very firmly.
<BR>"You may as well understand that I did not run
<BR>after this command.&nbsp; It was pushed in my way.
<BR>I've accepted it.&nbsp; I am here to take the ship home
<BR>first of all, and you may be sure that I shall see
<BR>to it that every one of you on board here does his
<BR>duty to that end.&nbsp; This is all I have to say--for
<BR>the present."

<P>He was on his feet by this time, but instead of
<BR>taking his dismissal he remained with trembling,
<BR>indignant lips, and looking at me hard as though,
<BR>really, after this, there was nothing for me to do in
<BR>common decency but to vanish from his outraged
<BR>sight.&nbsp; Like all very simple emotional states this
<BR>was moving.&nbsp; I felt sorry for him--almost sympa-
<BR>thetic, till (seeing that I did not vanish) he spoke
<BR>in a tone of forced restraint.

<P>"If I hadn't a wife and a child at home you may
<BR>be sure, sir, I would have asked you to let me go the
<BR>very minute you came on board."

<P>I answered him with a matter-of-course calmness
<BR>as though some remote third person were in question.

<P>"And I, Mr. Burns, would not have let you go.
<BR>You have signed the ship's articles as chief officer,
<BR>and till they are terminated at the final port of
<BR>discharge I shall expect you to attend to your duty
<BR>and give me the benefit of your experience to the
<BR>best of your ability."

<P>Stony incredulity lingered in his eyes: but it
<BR>broke down before my friendly attitude.&nbsp; With a
<BR>slight upward toss of his arms (I got to know that
<BR>gesture well afterward) he bolted out of the
<BR>cabin.

<P>We might have saved ourselves that little pas-
<BR>sage of harmless sparring.&nbsp; Before many days had
<BR>elapsed it was Mr. Burns who was pleading with
<BR>me anxiously not to leave him behind; while I could
<BR>only return him but doubtful answers.&nbsp; The whole
<BR>thing took on a somewhat tragic complexion.

<P>And this horrible problem was only an extrane-
<BR>ous episode, a mere complication in the general
<BR>problem of how to get that ship--which was mine
<BR>with her appurtenances and her men, with her body
<BR>and her spirit now slumbering in that pestilential
<BR>river--how to get her out to sea.

<P>Mr. Burns, while still acting captain, had
<BR>hastened to sign a charter-party which in an ideal
<BR>world without guile would have been an excellent
<BR>document.&nbsp; Directly I ran my eye over it I fore-
<BR>saw trouble ahead unless the people of the other
<BR>part were quite exceptionally fair-minded and open
<BR>to argument.

<P>Mr. Burns, to whom I imparted my fears, chose
<BR>to take great umbrage at them.&nbsp; He looked at me
<BR>with that usual incredulous stare, and said bitterly:

<P>"I suppose, sir, you want to make out I've acted
<BR>like a fool?"

<P>I told him, with my systematic kindliness which
<BR>always seemed to augment his surprise, that I did
<BR>not want to make out anything.&nbsp; I would leave
<BR>that to the future.

<P>And, sure enough, the future brought in a lot of
<BR>trouble.&nbsp; There were days when I used to remem-
<BR>ber Captain Giles with nothing short of abhor-
<BR>rence.&nbsp; His confounded acuteness had let me in
<BR>for this job; while his prophecy that I "would have
<BR>my hands full" coming true, made it appear as if
<BR>done on purpose to play an evil joke on my young
<BR>innocence.

<P>Yes.&nbsp; I had my hands full of complications which
<BR>were most valuable as "experience."&nbsp; People have
<BR>a great opinion of the advantages of experience.
<BR>But in this connection experience means always
<BR>something disagreeable as opposed to the charm
<BR>and innocence of illusions.

<P>I must say I was losing mine rapidly.&nbsp; But on
<BR>these instructive complications I must not enlarge
<BR>more than to say that they could all be resumed in
<BR>the one word: Delay.

<P>A mankind which has invented the proverb,
<BR>"Time is money," will understand my vexation.
<BR>The word "Delay" entered the secret chamber of
<BR>my brain, resounded there like a tolling bell which
<BR>maddens the ear, affected all my senses, took on a
<BR>black colouring, a bitter taste, a deadly meaning.

<P>"I am really sorry to see you worried like this.
<BR>Indeed, I am. . . ."

<P>It was the only humane speech I used to hear at
<BR>that time.&nbsp; And it came from a doctor, ap-
<BR>propriately enough.

<P>A doctor is humane by definition.&nbsp; But that man
<BR>was so in reality.&nbsp; His speech was not professional.
<BR>I was not ill.&nbsp; But other people were, and that was
<BR>the reason of his visiting the ship.

<P>He was the doctor of our Legation and, of course,
<BR>of the Consulate, too.&nbsp; He looked after the ship's
<BR>health, which generally was poor, and trembling,
<BR>as it were, on the verge of a break-up.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The
<BR>men ailed.&nbsp; And thus time was not only money,
<BR>but life as well.

<P>I had never seen such a steady ship's company.
<BR>As the doctor remarked to me: "You seem to have
<BR>a most respectable lot of seamen."&nbsp; Not only were
<BR>they consistently sober, but they did not even
<BR>want to go ashore.&nbsp; Care was taken to expose
<BR>them as little as possible to the sun.&nbsp; They were
<BR>employed on light work under the awnings.&nbsp; And
<BR>the humane doctor commended me.

<P>"Your arrangements appear to me to be very
<BR>judicious, my dear Captain."

<P>It is difficult to express how much that pro-
<BR>nouncement comforted me.&nbsp; The doctor's round,
<BR>full face framed in a light-coloured whisker was the
<BR>perfection of a dignified amenity.&nbsp; He was the only
<BR>human being in the world who seemed to take the
<BR>slightest interest in me.&nbsp; He would generally sit in
<BR>the cabin for half an hour or so at every visit.

<P>I said to him one day:

<P>"I suppose the only thing now is to take care of
<BR>them as you are doing till I can get the ship to
<BR>sea?"

<P>He inclined his head, shutting his eyes under the
<BR>large spectacles, and murmured:

<P>"The sea . . . undoubtedly."

<P>The first member of the crew fairly knocked over
<BR>was the steward--the first man to whom I had
<BR>spoken on board.&nbsp; He was taken ashore (with
<BR>choleric symptoms) and died there at the end of a
<BR>week.&nbsp; Then, while I was still under the startling
<BR>impression of this first home-thrust of the climate,
<BR>Mr. Burns gave up and went to bed in a raging
<BR>fever without saying a word to anybody.

<P>I believe he had partly fretted himself into that
<BR>illness; the climate did the rest with the swiftness
<BR>of an invisible monster ambushed in the air, in the
<BR>water, in the mud of the river-bank.&nbsp; Mr. Burns
<BR>was a predestined victim.

<P>I discovered him lying on his back, glaring sul-
<BR>lenly and radiating heat on one like a small furnace.
<BR>He would hardly answer my questions, and only
<BR>grumbled.&nbsp; Couldn't a man take an afternoon off
<BR>duty with a bad headache--for once?

<P>That evening, as I sat in the saloon after dinner,
<BR>I could hear him muttering continuously in his
<BR>room.&nbsp; Ransome, who was clearing the table, said
<BR>to me:

<P>"I am afraid, sir, I won't be able to give the mate
<BR>all the attention he's likely to need.&nbsp; I will have
<BR>to be forward in the galley a great part of my
<BR>time."

<P>Ransome was the cook.&nbsp; The mate had pointed
<BR>him out to me the first day, standing on the deck,
<BR>his arms crossed on his broad chest, gazing on the
<BR>river.

<P>Even at a distance his well-proportioned figure,
<BR>something thoroughly sailor-like in his poise, made
<BR>him noticeable.&nbsp; On nearer view the intelligent,
<BR>quiet eyes, a well-bred face, the disciplined in-
<BR>dependence of his manner made up an attractive
<BR>personality.&nbsp; When, in addition, Mr. Burns told
<BR>me that he was the best seaman in the ship, I ex-
<BR>pressed my surprise that in his earliest prime and of
<BR>such appearance he should sign on as cook on board
<BR>a ship.

<P>"It's his heart," Mr. Burns had said.&nbsp; "There's
<BR>something wrong with it.&nbsp; He mustn't exert him-
<BR>self too much or he may drop dead suddenly."

<P>And he was the only one the climate had not
<BR>touched--perhaps because, carrying a deadly
<BR>enemy in his breast, he had schooled himself into a
<BR>systematic control of feelings and movements.
<BR>When one was in the secret this was apparent in his
<BR>manner.&nbsp; After the poor steward died, and as he
<BR>could not be replaced by a white man in this
<BR>Oriental port, Ransome had volunteered to do the
<BR>double work.

<P>"I can do it all right, sir, as long as I go about it
<BR>quietly," he had assured me.

<P>But obviously he couldn't be expected to take up
<BR>sick-nursing in addition.&nbsp; Moreover, the doctor
<BR>peremptorily ordered Mr. Burns ashore.

<P>With a seaman on each side holding him up
<BR>under the arms, the mate went over the gangway
<BR>more sullen than ever.&nbsp; We built him up with pil-
<BR>lows in the gharry, and he made an effort to say
<BR>brokenly:

<P>"Now--you've got--what you wanted--got me
<BR>out of--the ship."

<P>"You were never more mistaken in your life,
<BR>Mr. Burns," I said quietly, duly smiling at him;
<BR>and the trap drove off to a sort of sanatorium, a
<BR>pavilion of bricks which the doctor had in the
<BR>grounds of his residence.

<P>I visited Mr. Burns regularly.&nbsp; After the first
<BR>few days, when he didn't know anybody, he re-
<BR>ceived me as if I had come either to gloat over an
<BR>enemy or else to curry favour with a deeply
<BR>wronged person.&nbsp; It was either one or the other,
<BR>just as it happened according to his fantastic sick-
<BR>room moods.&nbsp; Whichever it was, he managed to
<BR>convey it to me even during the period when he ap-
<BR>peared almost too weak to talk.&nbsp; I treated him to
<BR>my invariable kindliness.

<P>Then one day, suddenly, a surge of downright
<BR>panic burst through all this craziness.

<P>If I left him behind in this deadly place he would
<BR>die.&nbsp; He felt it, he was certain of it.&nbsp; But I
<BR>wouldn't have the heart to leave him ashore.&nbsp; He
<BR>had a wife and child in Sydney.

<P>He produced his wasted forearms from under the
<BR>sheet which covered him and clasped his fleshless
<BR>claws.&nbsp; He would die!&nbsp; He would die here. . . .

<P>He absolutely managed to sit up, but only for a
<BR>moment, and when he fell back I really thought
<BR>that he would die there and then.&nbsp; I called to the
<BR>Bengali dispenser, and hastened away from the
<BR>room.

<P>Next day he upset me thoroughly by renewing
<BR>his entreaties.&nbsp; I returned an evasive answer, and
<BR>left him the picture of ghastly despair.&nbsp; The day
<BR>after I went in with reluctance, and he attacked me
<BR>at once in a much stronger voice and with an
<BR>abundance of argument which was quite startling.
<BR>He presented his case with a sort of crazy vigour,
<BR>and asked me finally how would I like to have a
<BR>man's death on my conscience?&nbsp; He wanted me to
<BR>promise that I would not sail without him.

<P>I said that I really must consult the doctor first.
<BR>He cried out at that.&nbsp; The doctor!&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; That
<BR>would be a death sentence.

<P>The effort had exhausted him.&nbsp; He closed his
<BR>eyes, but went on rambling in a low voice.&nbsp; I had
<BR>hated him from the start.&nbsp; The late captain had
<BR>hated him, too.&nbsp; Had wished him dead.&nbsp; Had
<BR>wished all hands dead. . . .

<P>"What do you want to stand in with that wicked
<BR>corpse for, sir?&nbsp; He'll have you, too," he ended,
<BR>blinking his glazed eyes vacantly.

<P>"Mr. Burns," I cried, very much discomposed,
<BR>"what on earth are you talking about?"

<P>He seemed to come to himself, though he was too
<BR>weak to start.

<P>"I don't know," he said languidly.&nbsp; "But don't
<BR>ask that doctor, sir.&nbsp; You are I are sailors.&nbsp; Don't
<BR>ask him, sir.&nbsp; Some day perhaps you will have a
<BR>wife and child yourself."

<P>And again he pleaded for the promise that I
<BR>would not leave him behind.&nbsp; I had the firmness of
<BR>mind not to give it to him.&nbsp; Afterward this stern-
<BR>ness seemed criminal; for my mind was made up.
<BR>That prostrated man, with hardly strength enough
<BR>to breathe and ravaged by a passion of fear, was
<BR>irresistible.&nbsp; And, besides, he had happened to hit
<BR>on the right words.&nbsp; He and I were sailors.&nbsp; That
<BR>was a claim, for I had no other family.&nbsp; As to the
<BR>wife and child (some day) argument, it had no force.
<BR>It sounded merely bizarre.

<P>I could imagine no claim that would be stronger
<BR>and more absorbing than the claim of that ship, of
<BR>these men snared in the river by silly commercial
<BR>complications, as if in some poisonous trap.

<P>However, I had nearly fought my way out.&nbsp; Out
<BR>to sea.&nbsp; The sea--which was pure, safe, and
<BR>friendly.&nbsp; Three days more.

<P>That thought sustained and carried me on my
<BR>way back to the ship.&nbsp; In the saloon the doctor's
<BR>voice greeted me, and his large form followed his
<BR>voice, issuing out of the starboard spare cabin
<BR>where the ship's medicine chest was kept securely
<BR>lashed in the bed-place.

<P>Finding that I was not on board he had gone in
<BR>there, he said, to inspect the supply of drugs,
<BR>bandages, and so on.&nbsp; Everything was completed
<BR>and in order.

<P>I thanked him; I had just been thinking of
<BR>asking him to do that very thing, as in a couple of
<BR>days, as he knew, we were going to sea, where
<BR>all our troubles of every sort would be over at
<BR>last.

<P>He listened gravely and made no answer.&nbsp; But
<BR>when I opened to him my mind as to Mr. Burns he
<BR>sat down by my side, and, laying his hand on my
<BR>knee amicably, begged me to think what it was I
<BR>was exposing myself to.

<P>The man was just strong enough to bear being
<BR>moved and no more.&nbsp; But he couldn't stand a re-
<BR>turn of the fever.&nbsp; I had before me a passage of
<BR>sixty days perhaps, beginning with intricate navi-
<BR>gation and ending probably with a lot of bad
<BR>weather.&nbsp; Could I run the risk of having to go
<BR>through it single-handed, with no chief officer and
<BR>with a second quite a youth? . . .

<P>He might have added that it was my first com-
<BR>mand, too.&nbsp; He did probably think of that fact, for he
<BR>checked himself.&nbsp; It was very present to my mind.

<P>He advised me earnestly to cable to Singapore
<BR>for a chief officer, even if I had to delay my sailing
<BR>for a week.

<P>"Never," I said.&nbsp; The very thought gave me the
<BR>shivers.&nbsp; The hands seemed fairly fit, all of them,
<BR>and this was the time to get them away.&nbsp; Once at
<BR>sea I was not afraid of facing anything.&nbsp; The sea
<BR>was now the only remedy for all my troubles.

<P>The doctor's glasses were directed at me like two
<BR>lamps searching the genuineness of my resolution.
<BR>He opened his lips as if to argue further, but shut
<BR>them again without saying anything.&nbsp; I had a
<BR>vision so vivid of poor Burns in his exhaustion,
<BR>helplessness, and anguish, that it moved me more
<BR>than the reality I had come away from only an
<BR>hour before.&nbsp; It was purged from the drawbacks of
<BR>his personality, and I could not resist it.

<P>"Look here," I said.&nbsp; "Unless you tell me
<BR>officially that the man must not be moved I'll make
<BR>arrangements to have him brought on board to-
<BR>morrow, and shall take the ship out of the river
<BR>next morning, even if I have to anchor outside the
<BR>bar for a couple of days to get her ready for sea."

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I'll make all the arrangements myself,"
<BR>said the doctor at once.&nbsp; "I spoke as I did only as a
<BR>friend--as a well-wisher, and that sort of thing."

<P>He rose in his dignified simplicity and gave me a
<BR>warm handshake, rather solemnly, I thought.&nbsp; But
<BR>he was as good as his word.&nbsp; When Mr. Burns ap-
<BR>peared at the gangway carried on a stretcher, the
<BR>doctor himself walked by its side.&nbsp; The programme
<BR>had been altered in so far that this transportation
<BR>had been left to the last moment, on the very morn-
<BR>ing of our departure.

<P>It was barely an hour after sunrise.&nbsp; The doctor
<BR>waved his big arm to me from the shore and walked
<BR>back at once to his trap, which had followed him
<BR>empty to the river-side.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, carried across
<BR>the quarter-deck, had the appearance of being
<BR>absolutely lifeless.&nbsp; Ransome went down to settle
<BR>him in his cabin.&nbsp; I had to remain on deck to look
<BR>after the ship, for the tug had got hold of our tow-
<BR>rope already.

<P>The splash of our shore-fasts falling in the water
<BR>produced a complete change of feeling in me.&nbsp; It
<BR>was like the imperfect relief of awakening from a
<BR>nightmare.&nbsp; But when the ship's head swung down
<BR>the river away from that town, Oriental and
<BR>squalid, I missed the expected elation of that
<BR>striven-for moment.&nbsp; What there was, un-
<BR>doubtedly, was a relaxation of tension which trans-
<BR>lated itself into a sense of weariness after an in-
<BR>glorious fight.

<P>About midday we anchored a mile outside the
<BR>bar.&nbsp; The afternoon was busy for all hands.
<BR>Watching the work from the poop, where I re-
<BR>mained all the time, I detected in it some of the
<BR>languor of the six weeks spent in the steaming heat
<BR>of the river.&nbsp; The first breeze would blow that
<BR>away.&nbsp; Now the calm was complete.&nbsp; I judged
<BR>that the second officer--a callow youth with an
<BR>unpromising face--was not, to put it mildly, of that
<BR>invaluable stuff from which a commander's right
<BR>hand is made.&nbsp; But I was glad to catch along the
<BR>main deck a few smiles on those seamen's faces at
<BR>which I had hardly had time to have a good look as
<BR>yet.&nbsp; Having thrown off the mortal coil of shore
<BR>affairs, I felt myself familiar with them and yet a
<BR>little strange, like a long-lost wanderer among his
<BR>kin.

<P>Ransome flitted continually to and fro between
<BR>the galley and the cabin.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to
<BR>look at him.&nbsp; The man positively had grace.&nbsp; He
<BR>alone of all the crew had not had a day's illness in
<BR>port.&nbsp; But with the knowledge of that uneasy
<BR>heart within his breast I could detect the restraint
<BR>he put on the natural sailor-like agility of his
<BR>movements.&nbsp; It was as though he had something
<BR>very fragile or very explosive to carry about his
<BR>person and was all the time aware of it.

<P>I had occasion to address him once or twice.&nbsp; He
<BR>answered me in his pleasant, quiet voice and with a
<BR>faint, slightly wistful smile.&nbsp; Mr. Burns appeared
<BR>to be resting.&nbsp; He seemed fairly comfortable.

<P>After sunset I came out on deck again to meet
<BR>only a still void.&nbsp; The thin, featureless crust of the
<BR>coast could not be distinguished.&nbsp; The darkness
<BR>had risen around the ship like a mysterious emana-
<BR>tion from the dumb and lonely waters.&nbsp; I leaned
<BR>on the rail and turned my ear to the shadows of the
<BR>night.&nbsp; Not a sound.&nbsp; My command might have
<BR>been a planet flying vertiginously on its appointed
<BR>path in a space of infinite silence.&nbsp; I clung to the
<BR>rail as if my sense of balance were leaving me for
<BR>good.&nbsp; How absurd.&nbsp; I failed nervously.

<P>"On deck there!"

<P>The immediate answer, "Yes, sir," broke the
<BR>spell.&nbsp; The anchor-watch man ran up the poop
<BR>ladder smartly.&nbsp; I told him to report at once the
<BR>slightest sign of a breeze coming.

<P>Going below I looked in on Mr. Burns.&nbsp; In fact,
<BR>I could not avoid seeing him, for his door stood
<BR>open.&nbsp; The man was so wasted that, in this white
<BR>cabin, under a white sheet, and with his diminished
<BR>head sunk in the white pillow, his red moustaches
<BR>captured their eyes exclusively, like something arti-
<BR>ficial--a pair of moustaches from a shop exhibited
<BR>there in the harsh light of the bulkhead-lamp
<BR>without a shade.

<P>While I stared with a sort of wonder he asserted
<BR>himself by opening his eyes and even moving them
<BR>in my direction.&nbsp; A minute stir.

<P>"Dead calm, Mr. Burns," I said resignedly.

<P>In an unexpectedly distinct voice Mr. Burns be-
<BR>gan a rambling speech.&nbsp; Its tone was very strange,
<BR>not as if affected by his illness, but as if of a differ-
<BR>ent nature.&nbsp; It sounded unearthly.&nbsp; As to the
<BR>matter, I seemed to make out that it was the fault
<BR>of the "old man"--the late captain--ambushed
<BR>down there under the sea with some evil intention.
<BR>It was a weird story.

<P>I listened to the end; then stepping into the
<BR>cabin I laid my hand on the mate's forehead.&nbsp; It
<BR>was cool.&nbsp; He was light-headed only from extreme
<BR>weakness.&nbsp; Suddenly he seemed to become aware
<BR>of me, and in his own voice--of course, very feeble
<BR>--he asked regretfully:

<P>"Is there no chance at all to get under way, sir?"

<P>"What's the good of letting go our hold of the
<BR>ground only to drift, Mr. Burns?" I answered.

<P>He sighed and I left him to his immobility.&nbsp; His
<BR>hold on life was as slender as his hold on sanity.&nbsp; I
<BR>was oppressed by my lonely responsibilities.&nbsp; I
<BR>went into my cabin to seek relief in a few hours'
<BR>sleep, but almost before I closed my eyes the man
<BR>on deck came down reporting a light breeze.
<BR>Enough to get under way with, he said.

<P>And it was no more than just enough.&nbsp; I ordered
<BR>the windlass manned, the sails loosed, and the top-
<BR>sails set.&nbsp; But by the time I had cast the ship I
<BR>could hardly feel any breath of wind.&nbsp; Neverthe-
<BR>less, I trimmed the yards and put everything on
<BR>her.&nbsp; I was not going to give up the attempt.
