<P>AS WE all went up it occurred to me that there
<BR>ought to be a man at the helm.&nbsp; I raised my voice
<BR>not much above a whisper, and, noiselessly, an un-
<BR>complaining spirit in a fever-wasted body appeared
<BR>in the light aft, the head with hollow eyes illumi-
<BR>nated against the blackness which had swallowed
<BR>up our world--and the universe.&nbsp; The bared fore-
<BR>arm extended over the upper spokes seemed to
<BR>shine with a light of its own.

<P>I murmured to that luminous appearance:

<P>"Keep the helm right amidships."

<P>It answered in a tone of patient suffering:

<P>"Right amidships, sir."

<P>Then I descended to the quarter-deck.&nbsp; It was
<BR>impossible to tell whence the blow would come.&nbsp; To
<BR>look round the ship was to look into a bottomless,
<BR>black pit.&nbsp; The eye lost itself in inconceivable
<BR>depths.

<P>I wanted to ascertain whether the ropes had been
<BR>picked up off the deck.&nbsp; One could only do that by
<BR>feeling with one's feet.&nbsp; In my cautious progress I
<BR>came against a man in whom I recognized
<BR>Ransome.&nbsp; He possessed an unimpaired physical
<BR>solidity which was manifest to me at the contact.
<BR>He was leaning against the quarter-deck capstan
<BR>and kept silent.&nbsp; It was like a revelation.&nbsp; He was
<BR>the collapsed figure sobbing for breath I had no-
<BR>ticed before we went on the poop.

<P>"You have been helping with the mainsail!" I
<BR>exclaimed in a low tone.

<P>"Yes, sir," sounded his quiet voice.

<P>"Man!&nbsp; What were you thinking of?&nbsp; You
<BR>mustn't do that sort of thing."

<P>After a pause he assented: "I suppose I
<BR>mustn't."&nbsp; Then after another short silence he
<BR>added: "I am all right now," quickly, between the
<BR>tell-tale gasps.

<P>I could neither hear nor see anybody else; but
<BR>when I spoke up, answering sad murmurs filled the
<BR>quarter-deck, and its shadows seemed to shift here
<BR>and there.&nbsp; I ordered all the halyards laid down on
<BR>deck clear for running.

<P>"I'll see to that, sir," volunteered Ransome in
<BR>his natural, pleasant tone, which comforted one
<BR>and aroused one's compassion, too, somehow.

<P>That man ought to have been in his bed, resting,
<BR>and my plain duty was to send him there.&nbsp; But
<BR>perhaps he would not have obeyed me; I had not
<BR>the strength of mind to try.&nbsp; All I said was:

<P>"Go about it quietly, Ransome."

<P>Returning on the poop I approached Gambril.
<BR>His face, set with hollow shadows in the light,
<BR>looked awful, finally silenced.&nbsp; I asked him how
<BR>he felt, but hardly expected an answer.&nbsp; There-
<BR>fore, I was astonished at his comparative loquac-
<BR>ity.

<P>"Them shakes leaves me as weak as a kitten,
<BR>sir," he said, preserving finely that air of uncon-
<BR>sciousness as to anything but his business a helms-
<BR>man should never lose.&nbsp; "And before I can pick
<BR>up my strength that there hot fit comes along and
<BR>knocks me over again."

<P>He sighed.&nbsp; There was no reproach in his tone,
<BR>but the bare words were enough to give me a hor-
<BR>rible pang of self-reproach.&nbsp; It held me dumb for a
<BR>time.&nbsp; When the tormenting sensation had passed
<BR>off I asked:

<P>"Do you feel strong enough to prevent the rud-
<BR>der taking charge if she gets sternway on her?&nbsp; It
<BR>wouldn't do to get something smashed about the
<BR>steering-gear now.&nbsp; We've enough difficulties to
<BR>cope with as it is."

<P>He answered with just a shade of weariness that
<BR>he was strong enough to hang on.&nbsp; He could
<BR>promise me that she shouldn't take the wheel out
<BR>of his hands.&nbsp; More he couldn't say.

<P>At that moment Ransome appeared quite close
<BR>to me, stepping out of the darkness into visibility
<BR>suddenly, as if just created with his composed face
<BR>and pleasant voice.

<P>Every rope on deck, he said, was laid down clear
<BR>for running, as far as one could make certain
<BR>by feeling.&nbsp; It was impossible to see anything.
<BR>Frenchy had stationed himself forward.&nbsp; He said
<BR>he had a jump or two left in him yet.

<P>Here a faint smile altered for an instant the
<BR>clear, firm design of Ransome's lips.&nbsp; With his
<BR>serious clear, gray eyes, his serene temperament--
<BR>he was a priceless man altogether.&nbsp; Soul as firm
<BR>as the muscles of his body.

<P>He was the only man on board (except me, but I
<BR>had to preserve my liberty of movement) who had
<BR>a sufficiency of muscular strength to trust to.&nbsp; For
<BR>a moment I thought I had better ask him to take
<BR>the wheel.&nbsp; But the dreadful knowledge of the
<BR>enemy he had to carry about him made me hesi-
<BR>tate.&nbsp; In my ignorance of physiology it occurred
<BR>to me that he might die suddenly, from excitement,
<BR>at a critical moment.

<P>While this gruesome fear restrained the ready
<BR>words on the tip of my tongue, Ransome stepped
<BR>back two paces and vanished from my sight.

<P>At once an uneasiness possessed me, as if some
<BR>support had been withdrawn.&nbsp; I moved forward,
<BR>too, outside the circle of light, into the darkness
<BR>that stood in front of me like a wall.&nbsp; In one stride
<BR>I penetrated it.&nbsp; Such must have been the dark-
<BR>ness before creation.&nbsp; It had closed behind me.&nbsp; I
<BR>knew I was invisible to the man at the helm.
<BR>Neither could I see anything.&nbsp; He was alone, I was
<BR>alone, every man was alone where he stood.&nbsp; And
<BR>every form was gone, too, spar, sail, fittings, rails;
<BR>everything was blotted out in the dreadful smooth-
<BR>ness of that absolute night.

<P>A flash of lightning would have been a relief--I
<BR>mean physically.&nbsp; I would have prayed for it if it
<BR>hadn't been for my shrinking apprehension of the
<BR>thunder.&nbsp; In the tension of silence I was suffering
<BR>from it seemed to me that the first crash must turn
<BR>me into dust.

<P>And thunder was, most likely, what would hap-
<BR>pen next.&nbsp; Stiff all over and hardly breathing,
<BR>I waited with a horribly strained expectation.
<BR>Nothing happened.&nbsp; It was maddening, but a dull,
<BR>growing ache in the lower part of my face made me
<BR>aware that I had been grinding my teeth madly
<BR>enough, for God knows how long.

<P>It's extraordinary I should not have heard my-
<BR>self doing it; but I hadn't.&nbsp; By an effort which
<BR>absorbed all my faculties I managed to keep my
<BR>jaw still.&nbsp; It required much attention, and while
<BR>thus engaged I became bothered by curious, ir-
<BR>regular sounds of faint tapping on the deck.&nbsp; They
<BR>could be heard single, in pairs, in groups.&nbsp; While
<BR>I wondered at this mysterious devilry, I received
<BR>a slight blow under the left eye and felt an enor-
<BR>mous tear run down my cheek.&nbsp; Raindrops.
<BR>Enormous.&nbsp; Forerunners of something.
<BR>Tap.&nbsp; Tap.&nbsp; Tap. . . .

<P>I turned about, and, addressing Gambrel
<BR>earnestly, entreated him to "hang on to the wheel."
<BR>But I could hardly speak from emotion.&nbsp; The fatal
<BR>moment had come.&nbsp; I held my breath.&nbsp; The tap-
<BR>ping had stopped as unexpectedly as it had begun,
<BR>and there was a renewed moment of intolerable sus-
<BR>pense; something like an additional turn of the
<BR>racking screw.&nbsp; I don't suppose I would have ever
<BR>screamed, but I remember my conviction that
<BR>there was nothing else for it but to scream.

<P>Suddenly--how am I to convey it?&nbsp; Well, sud-
<BR>denly the darkness turned into water.&nbsp; This is the
<BR>only suitable figure.&nbsp; A heavy shower, a down-
<BR>pour, comes along, making a noise.&nbsp; You hear its
<BR>approach on the sea, in the air, too, I verily believe.
<BR>But this was different.&nbsp; With no preliminary
<BR>whisper or rustle, without a splash, and even with-
<BR>out the ghost of impact, I became instantaneously
<BR>soaked to the skin.&nbsp; Not a very difficult matter,
<BR>since I was wearing only my sleeping suit.&nbsp; My
<BR>hair got full of water in an instant, water streamed
<BR>on my skin, it filled my nose, my ears, my eyes.
<BR>In a fraction of a second I swallowed quite a lot
<BR>of it.

<P>As to Gambril, he was fairly choked.&nbsp; He
<BR>coughed pitifully, the broken cough of a sick man;
<BR>and I beheld him as one sees a fish in an aquarium
<BR>by the light of an electric bulb, an elusive, phos-
<BR>phorescent shape.&nbsp; Only he did not glide away.
<BR>But something else happened.&nbsp; Both binnacle-
<BR>lamps went out.&nbsp; I suppose the water forced itself
<BR>into them, though I wouldn't have thought that
<BR>possible, for they fitted into the cowl perfectly.

<P>The last gleam of light in the universe had gone,
<BR>pursued by a low exclamation of dismay from
<BR>Gambril.&nbsp; I groped for him and seized his arm.
<BR>How startlingly wasted it was.

<P>"Never mind," I said.&nbsp; "You don't want the
<BR>light.&nbsp; All you need to do is to keep the wind,
<BR>when it comes, at the back of your head.&nbsp; You
<BR>understand?"

<P>"Aye, aye, sir. . . .&nbsp; But I should like to have
<BR>a light," he added nervously.

<P>All that time the ship lay as steady as a rock.
<BR>The noise of the water pouring off the sails and
<BR>spars, flowing over the break of the poop, had
<BR>stopped short.&nbsp; The poop scuppers gurgled and
<BR>sobbed for a little while longer, and then perfect
<BR>silence, joined to perfect immobility, proclaimed
<BR>the yet unbroken spell of our helplessness, poised
<BR>on the edge of some violent issue, lurking in the
<BR>dark.

<P>I started forward restlessly.&nbsp; I did not need my
<BR>sight to pace the poop of my ill-starred first com-
<BR>mand with perfect assurance.&nbsp; Every square foot
<BR>of her decks was impressed indelibly on my brain,
<BR>to the very grain and knots of the planks.&nbsp; Yet, all
<BR>of a sudden, I fell clean over something, landing
<BR>full length on my hands and face.

<P>It was something big and alive.&nbsp; Not a dog--
<BR>more like a sheep, rather.&nbsp; But there were no
<BR>animals in the ship.&nbsp; How could an animal. . . .
<BR>It was an added and fantastic horror which I could
<BR>not resist.&nbsp; The hair of my head stirred even as I
<BR>picked myself up, awfully scared; not as a man is
<BR>scared while his judgment, his reason still try to
<BR>resist, but completely, boundlessly, and, as it were,
<BR>innocently scared--like a little child.

<P>I could see It--that Thing!&nbsp; The darkness, of
<BR>which so much had just turned into water, had
<BR>thinned down a little.&nbsp; There It was!&nbsp; But I did not
<BR>hit upon the notion of Mr. Burns issuing out of the
<BR>companion on all fours till he attempted to stand
<BR>up, and even then the idea of a bear crossed my
<BR>mind first.

<P>He growled like one when I seized him round the
<BR>body.&nbsp; He had buttoned himself up into an enor-
<BR>mous winter overcoat of some woolly material, the
<BR>weight of which was too much for his reduced state.
<BR>I could hardly feel the incredibly thin lath of his
<BR>body, lost within the thick stuff, but his growl had
<BR>depth and substance: Confounded dump ship with
<BR>a craven, tiptoeing crowd.&nbsp; Why couldn't they
<BR>stamp and go with a brace?&nbsp; Wasn't there one God-
<BR>forsaken lubber in the lot fit to raise a yell on a
<BR>rope?

<P>"Skulking's no good, sir," he attacked me
<BR>directly.&nbsp; "You can't slink past the old murderous
<BR>ruffian.&nbsp; It isn't the way.&nbsp; You must go for him
<BR>boldly--as I did.&nbsp; Boldness is what you want.
<BR>Show him that you don't care for any of his
<BR>damned tricks.&nbsp; Kick up a jolly old row."

<P>"Good God, Mr. Burns," I said angrily.
<BR>"What on earth are you up to?&nbsp; What do you
<BR>mean by coming up on deck in this state?"

<P>"Just that!&nbsp; Boldness.&nbsp; The only way to scare
<BR>the old bullying rascal."

<P>I pushed him, still growling, against the rail.
<BR>"Hold on to it," I said roughly.&nbsp; I did not know
<BR>what to do with him.&nbsp; I left him in a hurry, to go
<BR>to Gambril, who had called faintly that he believed
<BR>there was some wind aloft.&nbsp; Indeed, my own ears
<BR>had caught a feeble flutter of wet canvas, high up
<BR>overhead, the jingle of a slack chain sheet. . . .

<P>These were eerie, disturbing, alarming sounds in
<BR>the dead stillness of the air around me.&nbsp; All the
<BR>instances I had heard of topmasts being whipped
<BR>out of a ship while there was not wind enough on
<BR>her deck to blow out a match rushed into my
<BR>memory.

<P>"I can't see the upper sails, sir," declared
<BR>Gambril shakily.

<P>"Don't move the helm.&nbsp; You'll be all right," I
<BR>said confidently.

<P>The poor man's nerves were gone.&nbsp; Mine were
<BR>not in much better case.&nbsp; It was the moment of
<BR>breaking strain and was relieved by the abrupt
<BR>sensation of the ship moving forward as if of her-
<BR>self under my feet.&nbsp; I heard plainly the soughing
<BR>of the wind aloft, the low cracks of the upper spars
<BR>taking the strain, long before I could feel the least
<BR>draught on my face turned aft, anxious and sight-
<BR>less like the face of a blind man.

<P>Suddenly a louder-sounding note filled our ears,
<BR>the darkness started streaming against our bodies,
<BR>chilling them exceedingly.&nbsp; Both of us, Gambril
<BR>and I, shivered violently in our clinging, soaked
<BR>garments of thin cotton.&nbsp; I said to him:

<P>"You are all right now, my man.&nbsp; All you've got
<BR>to do is to keep the wind at the back of your head.
<BR>Surely you are up to that.&nbsp; A child could steer this
<BR>ship in smooth water."

<P>He muttered: "Aye!&nbsp; A healthy child."&nbsp; And I
<BR>felt ashamed of having been passed over by the
<BR>fever which had been preying on every man's
<BR>strength but mine, in order that my remorse might
<BR>be the more bitter, the feeling of unworthiness more
<BR>poignant, and the sense of responsibility heavier to
<BR>bear.

<P>The ship had gathered great way on her almost
<BR>at once on the calm water.&nbsp; I felt her slipping
<BR>through it with no other noise but a mysterious
<BR>rustle alongside.&nbsp; Otherwise, she had no motion at
<BR>all, neither lift nor roll.&nbsp; It was a disheartening
<BR>steadiness which had lasted for eighteen days
<BR>now; for never, never had we had wind enough in
<BR>that time to raise the slightest run of the sea.&nbsp; The
<BR>breeze freshened suddenly.&nbsp; I thought it was high
<BR>time to get Mr. Burns off the deck.&nbsp; He worried
<BR>me.&nbsp; I looked upon him as a lunatic who would be
<BR>very likely to start roaming over the ship and break
<BR>a limb or fall overboard.

<P>I was truly glad to find he had remained holding
<BR>on where I had left him, sensibly enough.&nbsp; He was,
<BR>however, muttering to himself ominously.

<P>This was discouraging.&nbsp; I remarked in a matter-
<BR>of-fact tone:

<P>"We have never had so much wind as this since
<BR>we left the roads."

<P>"There's some heart in it, too," he growled
<BR>judiciously.&nbsp; It was a remark of a perfectly sane
<BR>seaman.&nbsp; But he added immediately: "It was
<BR>about time I should come on deck.&nbsp; I've been
<BR>nursing my strength for this--just for this.&nbsp; Do
<BR>you see it, sir?"

<P>I said I did, and proceeded to hint that it would
<BR>be advisable for him to go below now and take a
<BR>rest.

<P>His answer was an indignant "Go below!&nbsp; Not if
<BR>I know it, sir."

<P>Very cheerful!&nbsp; He was a horrible nuisance.&nbsp; And
<BR>all at once he started to argue.&nbsp; I could feel his
<BR>crazy excitement in the dark.

<P>"You don't know how to go about it, sir.&nbsp; How
<BR>could you?&nbsp; All this whispering and tiptoeing is no
<BR>good.&nbsp; You can't hope to slink past a cunning,
<BR>wide-awake, evil brute like he was.&nbsp; You never
<BR>heard him talk.&nbsp; Enough to make your hair stand
<BR>on end.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; He wasn't mad.&nbsp; He was no
<BR>more mad than I am.&nbsp; He was just downright
<BR>wicked.&nbsp; Wicked so as to frighten most people.&nbsp; I
<BR>will tell you what he was.&nbsp; He was nothing less
<BR>than a thief and a murderer at heart.&nbsp; And do you
<BR>think he's any different now because he's dead?
<BR>Not he!&nbsp; His carcass lies a hundred fathom under,
<BR>but he's just the same . . . in latitude 8 d 20'
<BR>north."

<P>He snorted defiantly.&nbsp; I noted with weary resig-
<BR>nation that the breeze had got lighter while he
<BR>raved.&nbsp; He was at it again.

<P>"I ought to have thrown the beggar out of the
<BR>ship over the rail like a dog.&nbsp; It was only on ac-
<BR>count of the men. . . .&nbsp; Fancy having to read the
<BR>Burial Service over a brute like that! . . .&nbsp; 'Our
<BR>departed brother' . . . I could have laughed.
<BR>That was what he couldn't bear.&nbsp; I suppose I am
<BR>the only man that ever stood up to laugh at him.
<BR>When he got sick it used to scare that . . .
<BR>brother. . . .&nbsp; Brother. . . .&nbsp; Departed.
<BR>. . .&nbsp; Sooner call a shark brother."

<P>The breeze had let go so suddenly that the way
<BR>of the ship brought the wet sails heavily against the
<BR>mast.&nbsp; The spell of deadly stillness had caught
<BR>us up again.&nbsp; There seemed to be no escape.

<P>"Hallo!" exclaimed Mr. Burns in a startled
<BR>voice.&nbsp; "Calm again!"

<P>I addressed him as though he had been sane.

<P>"This is the sort of thing we've been having for
<BR>seventeen days, Mr. Burns," I said with intense
<BR>bitterness.&nbsp; "A puff, then a calm, and in a mo-
<BR>ment, you'll see, she'll be swinging on her heel with
<BR>her head away from her course to the devil some-
<BR>where."

<P>He caught at the word.&nbsp; "The old dodging
<BR>Devil," he screamed piercingly and burst into such
<BR>a loud laugh as I had never heard before.&nbsp; It was a
<BR>provoking, mocking peal, with a hair-raising,
<BR>screeching over-note of defiance.&nbsp; I stepped back,
<BR>utterly confounded.

<P>Instantly there was a stir on the quarter-deck;
<BR>murmurs of dismay.&nbsp; A distressed voice cried out
<BR>in the dark below us: "Who's that gone crazy,
<BR>now?"

<P>Perhaps they thought it was their captain?
<BR>Rush is not the word that could be applied to the
<BR>utmost speed the poor fellows were up to; but in
<BR>an amazing short time every man in the ship able
<BR>to walk upright had found his way on to that poop.

<P>I shouted to them: "It's the mate.&nbsp; Lay hold of
<BR>him a couple of you. . . ."

<P>I expected this performance to end in a ghastly
<BR>sort of fight.&nbsp; But Mr. Burns cut his derisive
<BR>screeching dead short and turned upon them
<BR>fiercely, yelling:

<P>"Aha!&nbsp; Dog-gone ye!&nbsp; You've found your
<BR>tongues--have ye?&nbsp; I thought you were dumb.
<BR>Well, then--laugh!&nbsp; Laugh--I tell you.&nbsp; Now then
<BR>--all together.&nbsp; One, two, three--laugh!"

<P>A moment of silence ensued, of silence so pro-
<BR>found that you could have heard a pin drop on the
<BR>deck.&nbsp; Then Ransome's unperturbed voice uttered
<BR>pleasantly the words:

<P>"I think he has fainted, sir--"&nbsp; The little
<BR>motionless knot of men stirred, with low murmurs
<BR>of relief.&nbsp; "I've got him under the arms.&nbsp; Get
<BR>hold of his legs, some one."

<P>Yes.&nbsp; It was a relief.&nbsp; He was silenced for a
<BR>time--for a time.&nbsp; I could not have stood another
<BR>peal of that insane screeching.&nbsp; I was sure of it;
<BR>and just then Gambril, the austere Gambril, treated
<BR>us to another vocal performance.&nbsp; He began to
<BR>sing out for relief.&nbsp; His voice wailed pitifully in
<BR>the darkness: "Come aft somebody!&nbsp; I can't
<BR>stand this.&nbsp; Here she'll be off again directly and I
<BR>can't. . . ."

<P>I dashed aft myself meeting on my way a hard
<BR>gust of wind whose approach Gambril's ear had
<BR>detected from afar and which filled the sails on the
<BR>main in a series of muffled reports mingled with the
<BR>low plaint of the spars.&nbsp; I was just in time to seize
<BR>the wheel while Frenchy who had followed me
<BR>caught up the collapsing Gambril.&nbsp; He hauled him
<BR>out of the way, admonished him to lie still where he
<BR>was, and then stepped up to relieve me, asking
<BR>calmly:

<P>"How am I to steer her, sir?"

<P>"Dead before it for the present.&nbsp; I'll get you a
<BR>light in a moment."

<P>But going forward I met Ransome bringing up
<BR>the spare binnacle lamp.&nbsp; That man noticed
<BR>everything, attended to everything, shed comfort
<BR>around him as he moved.&nbsp; As he passed me he re-
<BR>marked in a soothing tone that the stars were com-
<BR>ing out.&nbsp; They were.&nbsp; The breeze was sweeping
<BR>clear the sooty sky, breaking through the indolent
<BR>silence of the sea.

<P>The barrier of awful stillness which had encom-
<BR>passed us for so many days as though we had been
<BR>accursed, was broken.&nbsp; I felt that.&nbsp; I let myself
<BR>fall on to the skylight seat.&nbsp; A faint white ridge of
<BR>foam, thin, very thin, broke alongside.&nbsp; The first for
<BR>ages--for ages.&nbsp; I could have cheered, if it hadn't
<BR>been for the sense of guilt which clung to all
<BR>my thoughts secretly.&nbsp; Ransome stood before me.

<P>"What about the mate," I asked anxiously.
<BR>"Still unconscious?"

<P>"Well, sir--it's funny," Ransome was evidently
<BR>puzzled.&nbsp; "He hasn't spoken a word, and his eyes
<BR>are shut.&nbsp; But it looks to me more like sound sleep
<BR>than anything else."

<P>I accepted this view as the least troublesome of
<BR>any, or at any rate, least disturbing.&nbsp; Dead faint
<BR>or deep slumber, Mr. Burns had to be left to him-
<BR>self for the present.&nbsp; Ransome remarked sud-
<BR>denly:

<P>"I believe you want a coat, sir."

<P>"I believe I do," I sighed out.

<P>But I did not move.&nbsp; What I felt I wanted were
<BR>new limbs.&nbsp; My arms and legs seemed utterly use-
<BR>less, fairly worn out.&nbsp; They didn't even ache.&nbsp; But
<BR>I stood up all the same to put on the coat when
<BR>Ransome brought it up.&nbsp; And when he suggested
<BR>that he had better now "take Gambril forward," I
<BR>said:

<P>"All right.&nbsp; I'll help you to get him down on the
<BR>main deck."

<P>I found that I was quite able to help, too.&nbsp; We
<BR>raised Gambril up between us.&nbsp; He tried to help
<BR>himself along like a man but all the time he was in-
<BR>quiring piteously:

<P>"You won't let me go when we come to the lad-
<BR>der?&nbsp; You won't let me go when we come to the
<BR>ladder?"
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The breeze kept on freshening and blew true,
<BR>true to a hair.&nbsp; At daylight by careful manipula-
<BR>tion of the helm we got the foreyards to run square
<BR>by themselves (the water keeping smooth) and
<BR>then went about hauling the ropes tight.&nbsp; Of the
<BR>four men I had with me at night, I could see now
<BR>only two.&nbsp; I didn't inquire as to the others.&nbsp; They
<BR>had given in.&nbsp; For a time only I hoped.

<P>Our various tasks forward occupied us for hours,
<BR>the two men with me moved so slow and had to
<BR>rest so often.&nbsp; One of them remarked that "every
<BR>blamed thing in the ship felt about a hundred times
<BR>heavier than its proper weight."&nbsp; This was the
<BR>only complaint uttered.&nbsp; I don't know what we
<BR>should have done without Ransome.&nbsp; He worked
<BR>with us, silent, too, with a little smile frozen on his
<BR>lips.&nbsp; From time to time I murmured to him:
<BR>"Go steady"--"Take it easy, Ransome"--and re-
<BR>ceived a quick glance in reply.

<P>When we had done all we could do to make
<BR>things safe, he disappeared into his galley.&nbsp; Some
<BR>time afterward, going forward for a look round, I
<BR>caught sight of him through the open door.&nbsp; He
<BR>sat upright on the locker in front of the stove, with
<BR>his head leaning back against the bulkhead.&nbsp; His
<BR>eyes were closed; his capable hands held open the
<BR>front of his thin cotton shirt baring tragically
<BR>his powerful chest, which heaved in painful and
<BR>laboured gasps.&nbsp; He didn't hear me.

<P>I retreated quietly and went straight on to the
<BR>poop to relieve Frenchy, who by that time was be-
<BR>ginning to look very sick.&nbsp; He gave me the course
<BR>with great formality and tried to go off with a
<BR>jaunty step, but reeled widely twice before getting
<BR>out of my sight.

<P>And then I remained all alone aft, steering my
<BR>ship, which ran before the wind with a buoyant lift
<BR>now and then, and even rolling a little.&nbsp; Presently
<BR>Ransome appeared before me with a tray.&nbsp; The
<BR>sight of food made me ravenous all at once.&nbsp; He
<BR>took the wheel while I sat down of the after grating
<BR>to eat my breakfast.

<P>"This breeze seems to have done for our crowd,"
<BR>he murmured.&nbsp; "It just laid them low--all hands."

<P>"Yes," I said.&nbsp; "I suppose you and I are the
<BR>only two fit men in the ship."

<P>"Frenchy says there's still a jump left in him.&nbsp; I
<BR>don't know.&nbsp; It can't be much," continued Ran-
<BR>some with his wistful smile.&nbsp; Good little man that.
<BR>But suppose, sir, that this wind flies round when
<BR>we are close to the land--what are we going to do
<BR>with her?"

<P>"If the wind shifts round heavily after we close
<BR>in with the land she will either run ashore or get
<BR>dismasted or both.&nbsp; We won't be able to do any-
<BR>thing with her.&nbsp; She's running away with us now.
<BR>All we can do is to steer her.&nbsp; She's a ship without a
<BR>crew."

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; All laid low," repeated Ransome quietly.
<BR>"I do give them a look-in forward every now and
<BR>then, but it's precious little I can do for them."

<P>"I, and the ship, and every one on board of her,
<BR>are very much indebted to you, Ransome," I said
<BR>warmly.

<P>He made as though he had not heard me, and
<BR>steered in silence till I was ready to relieve him.&nbsp; He
<BR>surrendered the wheel, picked up the tray, and for a
<BR>parting shot informed me that Mr. Burns was awake
<BR>and seemed to have a mind to come up on deck.

<P>"I don't know how to prevent him, sir.&nbsp; I can't
<BR>very well stop down below all the time."

<P>It was clear that he couldn't.&nbsp; And sure enough
<BR>Mr. Burns came on deck dragging himself painfully
<BR>aft in his enormous overcoat.&nbsp; I beheld him with a
<BR>natural dread.&nbsp; To have him around and raving
<BR>about the wiles of a dead man while I had to steer a
<BR>wildly rushing ship full of dying men was a rather
<BR>dreadful prospect.

<P>But his first remarks were quite sensible in mean-
<BR>ing and tone.&nbsp; Apparently he had no recollection
<BR>of the night scene.&nbsp; And if he had he didn't betray
<BR>himself once.&nbsp; Neither did he talk very much.&nbsp; He
<BR>sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first,
<BR>but that strong breeze, before which the last rem-
<BR>nant of my crew had wilted down, seemed to blow a
<BR>fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust.
<BR>One could almost see the process.

<P>By way of sanity test I alluded on purpose to the
<BR>late captain.&nbsp; I was delighted to find that Mr.
<BR>Burns did not display undue interest in the sub-
<BR>ject.&nbsp; He ran over the old tale of that savage
<BR>ruffian's iniquities with a certain vindictive gusto
<BR>and then concluded unexpectedly:

<P>"I do believe, sir, that his brain began to go a
<BR>year or more before he died."

<P>A wonderful recovery.&nbsp; I could hardly spare it
<BR>as much admiration as it deserved, for I had to give
<BR>all my mind to the steering.

<P>In comparison with the hopeless languour of the
<BR>preceding days this was dizzy speed.&nbsp; Two ridges
<BR>of foam streamed from the ship's bows; the wind
<BR>sang in a strenuous note which under other cir-
<BR>cumstances would have expressed to me all the joy
<BR>of life.&nbsp; Whenever the hauled-up mainsail started
<BR>trying to slat and bang itself to pieces in its gear,
<BR>Mr. Burns would look at me apprehensively.

<P>"What would you have me to do, Mr. Burns?
<BR>We can neither furl it nor set it.&nbsp; I only wish the
<BR>old thing would thrash itself to pieces and be done
<BR>with it.&nbsp; That beastly racket confuses me."

<P>Mr. Burns wrung his hands, and cried out sud-
<BR>denly:

<P>"How will you get the ship into harbour, sir,
<BR>without men to handle her?"

<P>And I couldn't tell him.

<P>Well--it did get done about forty hours after-
<BR>ward.&nbsp; By the exorcising virtue of Mr. Burns'
<BR>awful laugh, the malicious spectre had been laid,
<BR>the evil spell broken, the curse removed.&nbsp; We were
<BR>now in the hands of a kind and energetic Provi-
<BR>dence.&nbsp; It was rushing us on. . . .

<P>I shall never forget the last night, dark, windy,
<BR>and starry.&nbsp; I steered.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, after having
<BR>obtained from me a solemn promise to give him a
<BR>kick if anything happened, went frankly to sleep on
<BR>the deck close to the binnacle.&nbsp; Convalescents
<BR>need sleep.&nbsp; Ransome, his back propped against
<BR>the mizzen-mast and a blanket over his legs, re-
<BR>mained perfectly still, but I don't suppose he
<BR>closed his eyes for a moment.&nbsp; That embodiment
<BR>of jauntiness, Frenchy, still under the delusion that
<BR>there was a "jump" left in him, had insisted on
<BR>joining us; but mindful of discipline, had laid him-
<BR>self down as far on the forepart of the poop as he
<BR>could get, alongside the bucket-rack.

<P>And I steered, too tired for anxiety, too tired for
<BR>connected thought.&nbsp; I had moments of grim ex-
<BR>ultation and then my heart would sink awfully
<BR>at the thought of that forecastle at the other end
<BR>of the dark deck, full of fever-stricken men--some
<BR>of them dying.&nbsp; By my fault.&nbsp; But never mind.
<BR>Remorse must wait.&nbsp; I had to steer.

<P>In the small hours the breeze weakened, then
<BR>failed altogether.&nbsp; About five it returned, gentle
<BR>enough, enabling us to head for the roadstead.
<BR>Daybreak found Mr. Burns sitting wedged up with
<BR>coils of rope on the stern-grating, and from the
<BR>depths of his overcoat steering the ship with very
<BR>white bony hands; while Ransome and I rushed
<BR>along the decks letting go all the sheets and hal-
<BR>liards by the run.&nbsp; We dashed next up on to the
<BR>forecastle head.&nbsp; The perspiration of labour and
<BR>sheer nervousness simply poured off our heads as
<BR>we toiled to get the anchors cock-billed.&nbsp; I dared
<BR>not look at Ransome as we worked side by side.
<BR>We exchanged curt words; I could hear him panting
<BR>close to me and I avoided turning my eyes his way
<BR>for fear of seeing him fall down and expire in the
<BR>act of putting forth his strength--for what?&nbsp; In-
<BR>deed for some distinct ideal.

<P>The consummate seaman in him was aroused.
<BR>He needed no directions.&nbsp; He knew what to do.
<BR>Every effort, every movement was an act of con-
<BR>sistent heroism.&nbsp; It was not for me to look at a man
<BR>thus inspired.

<P>At last all was ready and I heard him say:

<P>"Hadn't I better go down and open the compressors now, sir?"

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; Do," I said.

<P>And even then I did not glance his way.&nbsp; After a
<BR>time his voice came up from the main deck.

<P>"When you like, sir.&nbsp; All clear on the windlass here."

<P>I made a sign to Mr. Burns to put the helm
<BR>down and let both anchors go one after another,
<BR>leaving the ship to take as much cable as she
<BR>wanted.&nbsp; She took the best part of them both be-
<BR>fore she brought up.&nbsp; The loose sails coming aback
<BR>ceased their maddening racket above my head.&nbsp; A
<BR>perfect stillness reigned in the ship.&nbsp; And while I
<BR>stood forward feeling a little giddy in that sudden
<BR>peace, I caught faintly a moan or two and the in-
<BR>coherent mutterings of the sick in the forecastle.

<P>As we had a signal for medical assistance flying
<BR>on the mizzen it is a fact that before the ship was
<BR>fairly at rest three steam launches from various
<BR>men-of-war were alongside; and at least five naval
<BR>surgeons had clambered on board.&nbsp; They stood in
<BR>a knot gazing up and down the empty main deck,
<BR>then looked aloft--where not a man could be seen,
<BR>either.

<P>I went toward them--a solitary figure, in a blue
<BR>and gray striped sleeping suit and a pipe-clayed cork
<BR>helmet on its head.&nbsp; Their disgust was extreme.
<BR>They had expected surgical cases.&nbsp; Each one had
<BR>brought his carving tools with him.&nbsp; But they soon
<BR>got over their little disappointment.&nbsp; In less than
<BR>five minutes one of the steam launches was rushing
<BR>shoreward to order a big boat and some hospital
<BR>people for the removal of the crew.&nbsp; The big
<BR>steam pinnace went off to her ship to bring over a
<BR>few bluejackets to furl my sails for me.

<P>One of the surgeons had remained on board.&nbsp; He
<BR>came out of the forecastle looking impenetrable,
<BR>and noticed my inquiring gaze.

<P>"There's nobody dead in there, if that's what
<BR>you want to know," he said deliberately.&nbsp; Then
<BR>added in a tone of wonder: "The whole crew!"

<P>"And very bad?"

<P>"And very bad," he repeated.&nbsp; His eyes were
<BR>roaming all over the ship.&nbsp; "Heavens!&nbsp; What's
<BR>that?"

<P>"That," I said, glancing aft, "is Mr. Burns, my
<BR>chief officer."

<P>Mr. Burns with his moribund head nodding on
<BR>the stalk of his lean neck was a sight for any one
<BR>to exclaim at.&nbsp; The surgeon asked:

<P>"Is he going to the hospital, too?"

<P>"Oh, no," I said jocosely.&nbsp; "Mr. Burns can't go
<BR>on shore till the mainmast goes.&nbsp; I am very proud
<BR>of him.&nbsp; He's my only convalescent."

<P>"You look--" began the doctor staring at me.
<BR>But I interrupted him angrily:

<P>"I am not ill."

<P>"No. . . .&nbsp; You look queer."

<P>"Well, you see, I have been seventeen days on deck."

<P>"Seventeen! . . .&nbsp; But you must have slept."

<P>"I suppose I must have.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But I'm certain
<BR>that I didn't sleep for the last forty hours."

<P>"Phew! . . .&nbsp; You will be going ashore presently I suppose?"

<P>"As soon as ever I can.&nbsp; There's no end of
<BR>business waiting for me there."

<P>The surgeon released my hand, which he had
<BR>taken while we talked, pulled out his pocket-book,
<BR>wrote in it rapidly, tore out the page and offered
<BR>it to me.

<P>"I strongly advise you to get this prescription
<BR>made up for yourself ashore.&nbsp; Unless I am much
<BR>mistaken you will need it this evening."

<P>"What is it, then?" I asked with suspicion.

<P>"Sleeping draught," answered the surgeon
<BR>curtly; and moving with an air of interest toward
<BR>Mr. Burns he engaged him in conversation.

<P>As I went below to dress to go ashore, Ransome
<BR>followed me.&nbsp; He begged my pardon; he wished,
<BR>too, to be sent ashore and paid off.

<P>I looked at him in surprise.&nbsp; He was waiting for
<BR>my answer with an air of anxiety.

<P>"You don't mean to leave the ship!" I cried
<BR>out.

<P>"I do really, sir.&nbsp; I want to go and be quiet some-
<BR>where.&nbsp; Anywhere.&nbsp; The hospital will do."

<P>"But, Ransome," I said.&nbsp; "I hate the idea of
<BR>parting with you."

<P>"I must go," he broke in.&nbsp; "I have a right!"
<BR>. . .&nbsp; He gasped and a look of almost savage de-
<BR>termination passed over his face.&nbsp; For an instant
<BR>he was another being.&nbsp; And I saw under the worth
<BR>and the comeliness of the man the humble reality
<BR>of things.&nbsp; Life was a boon to him--this precarious
<BR>hard life, and he was thoroughly alarmed about
<BR>himself.

<P>"Of course I shall pay you off if you wish it," I
<BR>hastened to say.&nbsp; "Only I must ask you to remain
<BR>on board till this afternoon.&nbsp; I can't leave Mr.
<BR>Burns absolutely by himself in the ship for hours."

<P>He softened at once and assured me with a smile
<BR>and in his natural pleasant voice that he under-
<BR>stood that very well.

<P>When I returned on deck everything was ready
<BR>for the removal of the men.&nbsp; It was the last ordeal
<BR>of that episode which had been maturing and tem-
<BR>pering my character--though I did not know it.

<P>It was awful.&nbsp; They passed under my eyes one
<BR>after another--each of them an embodied reproach
<BR>of the bitterest kind, till I felt a sort of revolt wake
<BR>up in me.&nbsp; Poor Frenchy had gone suddenly under.
<BR>He was carried past me insensible, his comic
<BR>face horribly flushed and as if swollen, breathing
<BR>stertorously.&nbsp; He looked more like Mr. Punch than
<BR>ever; a disgracefully intoxicated Mr. Punch.

<P>The austere Gambril, on the contrary, had im-
<BR>proved temporarily.&nbsp; He insisted on walking on
<BR>his own feet to the rail--of course with assistance
<BR>on each side of him.&nbsp; But he gave way to a sudden
<BR>panic at the moment of being swung over the side
<BR>and began to wail pitifully:

<P>"Don't let them drop me, sir.&nbsp; Don't let them
<BR>drop me, sir!"&nbsp; While I kept on shouting to him in
<BR>most soothing accents: "All right, Gambril.
<BR>They won't!&nbsp; They won't!"

<P>It was no doubt very ridiculous.&nbsp; The blue-
<BR>jackets on our deck were grinning quietly, while
<BR>even Ransome himself (much to the fore in lending
<BR>a hand) had to enlarge his wistful smile for a fleet-
<BR>ing moment.

<P>I left for the shore in the steam pinnace, and on
<BR>looking back beheld Mr. Burns actually standing
<BR>up by the taffrail, still in his enormous woolly over-
<BR>coat.&nbsp; The bright sunlight brought out his weird-
<BR>ness amazingly.&nbsp; He looked like a frightful and
<BR>elaborate scarecrow set up on the poop of a death-
<BR>stricken ship, set up to keep the seabirds from the
<BR>corpses.

<P>Our story had got about already in town and
<BR>everybody on shore was most kind.&nbsp; The Marine
<BR>Office let me off the port dues, and as there hap-
<BR>pened to be a shipwrecked crew staying in the
<BR>Home I had no difficulty in obtaining as many men
<BR>as I wanted.&nbsp; But when I inquired if I could see
<BR>Captain Ellis for a moment I was told in accents of
<BR>pity for my ignorance that our deputy-Neptune
<BR>had retired and gone home on a pension about
<BR>three weeks after I left the port.&nbsp; So I suppose that
<BR>my appointment was the last act, outside the
<BR>daily routine, of his official life.

<P>It is strange how on coming ashore I was struck
<BR>by the springy step, the lively eyes, the strong
<BR>vitality of every one I met.&nbsp; It impressed me
<BR>enormously.&nbsp; And amongst those I met there was
<BR>Captain Giles, of course.&nbsp; It would have been very
<BR>extraordinary if I had not met him.&nbsp; A prolonged
<BR>stroll in the business part of the town was the
<BR>regular employment of all his mornings when he
<BR>was ashore.

<P>I caught the glitter of the gold watch-chain
<BR>across his chest ever so far away.&nbsp; He radiated
<BR>benevolence.

<P>"What is it I hear?" he queried with a "kind
<BR>uncle" smile, after shaking hands.&nbsp; "Twenty-one
<BR>days from Bangkok?"

<P>"Is this all you've heard?" I said.&nbsp; "You must
<BR>come to tiffin with me.&nbsp; I want you to know ex-
<BR>actly what you have let me in for."

<P>He hesitated for almost a minute.

<P>"Well--I will," he said condescendingly at last.

<P>We turned into the hotel.&nbsp; I found to my sur-
<BR>prise that I could eat quite a lot.&nbsp; Then over the
<BR>cleared table-cloth I unfolded to Captain Giles the
<BR>history of these twenty days in all its professional
<BR>and emotional aspects, while he smoked patiently
<BR>the big cigar I had given him.

<P>Then he observed sagely:

<P>"You must feel jolly well tired by this time."

<P>"No," I said.&nbsp; "Not tired.&nbsp; But I'll tell you,
<BR>Captain Giles, how I feel.&nbsp; I feel old.&nbsp; And I must
<BR>be.&nbsp; All of you on shore look to me just a lot of
<BR>skittish youngsters that have never known a care
<BR>in the world."

<P>He didn't smile.&nbsp; He looked insufferably ex-
<BR>emplary.&nbsp; He declared:

<P>"That will pass.&nbsp; But you do look older--it's a
<BR>fact."

<P>"Aha!" I said.

<P>"No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; The truth is that one must not make
<BR>too much of anything in life, good or bad."

<P>"Live at half-speed," I murmured perversely.
<BR>"Not everybody can do that."

<P>"You'll be glad enough presently if you can keep
<BR>going even at that rate," he retorted with his air of
<BR>conscious virtue.&nbsp; "And there's another thing: a
<BR>man should stand up to his bad luck, to his mis-
<BR>takes, to his conscience and all that sort of thing.
<BR>Why--what else would you have to fight against."

<P>I kept silent.&nbsp; I don't know what he saw in my
<BR>face but he asked abruptly:

<P>"Why--you aren't faint-hearted?"

<P>"God only knows, Captain Giles," was my sin-
<BR>cere answer.

<P>"That's all right," he said calmly.&nbsp; "You will
<BR>learn soon how not to be faint-hearted.&nbsp; A man has
<BR>got to learn everything--and that's what so many
<BR>of them youngsters don't understand."

<P>"Well, I am no longer a youngster."

<P>"No," he conceded.&nbsp; "Are you leaving soon?"

<P>"I am going on board directly," I said.&nbsp; "I shall
<BR>pick up one of my anchors and heave in to half-
<BR>cable on the other directly my new crew comes on
<BR>board and I shall be off at daylight to-morrow!"

<P>"You will," grunted Captain Giles approvingly.
<BR>"that's the way.&nbsp; You'll do."

<P>"What did you think?&nbsp; That I would want to
<BR>take a week ashore for a rest?" I said, irritated by
<BR>his tone.&nbsp; "There's no rest for me till she's out
<BR>in the Indian Ocean and not much of it even
<BR>then."

<P>He puffed at his cigar moodily, as if transformed.

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; That's what it amounts to," he said in a
<BR>musing tone.&nbsp; It was as if a ponderous curtain had
<BR>rolled up disclosing an unexpected Captain Giles.
<BR>But it was only for a moment, just the time to let
<BR>him add, "Precious little rest in life for anybody.
<BR>Better not think of it."

<P>We rose, left the hotel, and parted from each
<BR>other in the street with a warm handshake, just as
<BR>he began to interest me for the first time in our
<BR>intercourse.

<P>The first thing I saw when I got back to the ship
<BR>was Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly
<BR>on his neatly lashed sea-chest.

<P>I beckoned him to follow me into the saloon
<BR>where I sat down to write a letter of recommenda-
<BR>tion for him to a man I knew on shore.

<P>When finished I pushed it across the table.&nbsp; "It
<BR>may be of some good to you when you leave the
<BR>hospital."

<P>He took it, put it in his pocket.&nbsp; His eyes were
<BR>looking away from me--nowhere.&nbsp; His face was
<BR>anxiously set.

<P>"How are you feeling now?" I asked.

<P>"I don't feel bad now, sir," he answered stiffly.
<BR>"But I am afraid of its coming on. . . ."&nbsp; The
<BR>wistful smile came back on his lips for a mo-
<BR>ment.&nbsp; "I--I am in a blue funk about my heart,
<BR>sir."

<P>I approached him with extended hand.&nbsp; His
<BR>eyes not looking at me had a strained expres-
<BR>sion.&nbsp; He was like a man listening for a warning
<BR>call.

<P>"Won't you shake hands, Ransome?" I said
<BR>gently.

<P>He exclaimed, flushed up dusky red, gave my
<BR>hand a hard wrench--and next moment, left alone
<BR>in the cabin, I listened to him going up the com-
<BR>panion stairs cautiously, step by step, in mortal
<BR>fear of starting into sudden anger our common
<BR>enemy it was his hard fate to carry consciously
<BR>within his faithful breast.
