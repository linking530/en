<P>ONLY the young have such moments.&nbsp; I don't
<BR>mean the very young.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The very young have,
<BR>properly speaking, no moments.&nbsp; It is the privi-
<BR>lege of early youth to live in advance of its days
<BR>in all the beautiful continuity of hope which
<BR>knows no pauses and no introspection.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One closes behind one the little gate of mere
<BR>boyishness--and enters an enchanted garden.&nbsp; Its
<BR>very shades glow with promise.&nbsp; Every turn of the
<BR>path has its seduction.&nbsp; And it isn't because it
<BR>is an undiscovered country.&nbsp; One knows well
<BR>enough that all mankind had streamed that way.
<BR>It is the charm of universal experience from which
<BR>one expects an uncommon or personal sensation--
<BR>a bit of one's own.

<P>One goes on recognizing the landmarks of the
<BR>predecessors, excited, amused, taking the hard
<BR>luck and the good luck together--the kicks and
<BR>the halfpence, as the saying is--the picturesque
<BR>common lot that holds so many possibilities for
<BR>the deserving or perhaps for the lucky.&nbsp; Yes.
<BR>One goes on.&nbsp; And the time, too, goes on--till one
<BR>perceives ahead a shadow-line warning one that
<BR>the region of early youth, too, must be left be-
<BR>hind.

<P>This is the period of life in which such moments
<BR>of which I have spoken are likely to come.&nbsp; What
<BR>moments?&nbsp; Why, the moments of boredom, of
<BR>weariness, of dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Rash moments.
<BR>I mean moments when the still young are inclined
<BR>to commit rash actions, such as getting married
<BR>suddenly or else throwing up a job for no rea-
<BR>son.

<P>This is not a marriage story.&nbsp; It wasn't so bad
<BR>as that with me.&nbsp; My action, rash as it was, had
<BR>more the character of divorce--almost of deser-
<BR>tion.&nbsp; For no reason on which a sensible person
<BR>could put a finger I threw up my job--chucked
<BR>my berth--left the ship of which the worst that
<BR>could be said was that she was a steamship and
<BR>therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind
<BR>loyalty which. . . .&nbsp; However, it's no use try-
<BR>ing to put a gloss on what even at the time I myself
<BR>half suspected to be a caprice.

<P>It was in an Eastern port.&nbsp; She was an Eastern
<BR>ship, inasmuch as then she belonged to that port.
<BR>She traded among dark islands on a blue reef-
<BR>scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail
<BR>and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but
<BR>with a green border and with a white crescent in
<BR>it.&nbsp; For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that.
<BR>Hence the green border on the flag.&nbsp; He was the
<BR>head of a great House of Straits Arabs, but as
<BR>loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as
<BR>you could find east of the Suez Canal.&nbsp; World
<BR>politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a
<BR>great occult power amongst his own people.

<P>It was all one to us who owned the ship.&nbsp; He
<BR>had to employ white men in the shipping part of
<BR>his business, and many of those he so employed
<BR>had never set eyes on him from the first to the
<BR>last day.&nbsp; I myself saw him but once, quite
<BR>accidentally on a wharf--an old, dark little man
<BR>blind in one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow
<BR>slippers.&nbsp; He was having his hand severely kissed
<BR>by a crowd of Malay pilgrims to whom he had
<BR>done some favour, in the way of food and money.
<BR>His alms-giving, I have heard, was most exten-
<BR>sive, covering almost the whole Archipelago.&nbsp; For
<BR>isn't it said that "The charitable man is the friend
<BR>of Allah"?

<P>Excellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about
<BR>whom one needed not to trouble one's head, a
<BR>most excellent Scottish ship--for she was that
<BR>from the keep up--excellent sea-boat, easy to
<BR>keep clean, most handy in every way, and if it
<BR>had not been for her internal propulsion, worthy
<BR>of any man's love, I cherish to this day a profound
<BR>respect for her memory.&nbsp; As to the kind of trade
<BR>she was engaged in and the character of my ship-
<BR>mates, I could not have been happier if I had had
<BR>the life and the men made to my order by a
<BR>benevolent Enchanter.

<P>And suddenly I left all this.&nbsp; I left it in that,
<BR>to us, inconsequential manner in which a bird
<BR>flies away from a comfortable branch.&nbsp; It was as
<BR>though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or
<BR>seen something.&nbsp; Well--perhaps!&nbsp; One day I was
<BR>perfectly right and the next everything was gone
<BR>--glamour, flavour, interest, contentment--every-
<BR>thing.&nbsp; It was one of these moments, you know.
<BR>The green sickness of late youth descended on me
<BR>and carried me off.&nbsp; Carried me off that ship, I
<BR>mean.

<P>We were only four white men on board, with a
<BR>large crew of Kalashes and two Malay petty
<BR>officers.&nbsp; The Captain stared hard as if wondering
<BR>what ailed me.&nbsp; But he was a sailor, and he, too,
<BR>had been young at one time.&nbsp; Presently a smile
<BR>came to lurk under his thick iron-gray moustache,
<BR>and he observed that, of course, if I felt I must
<BR>go he couldn't keep me by main force.&nbsp; And it was
<BR>arranged that I should be paid off the next morn-
<BR>ing.&nbsp; As I was going out of his cabin he added
<BR>suddenly, in a peculiar wistful tone, that he hoped
<BR>I would find what I was so anxious to go and look
<BR>for.&nbsp; A soft, cryptic utterance which seemed to
<BR>reach deeper than any diamond-hard tool could
<BR>have done.&nbsp; I do believe he understood my case.

<P>But the second engineer attacked me differently.
<BR>He was a sturdy young Scot, with a smooth face and
<BR>light eyes.&nbsp; His honest red countenance emerged
<BR>out of the engine-room companion and then the
<BR>whole robust man, with shirt sleeves turned up,
<BR>wiping slowly the massive fore-arms with a lump
<BR>of cotton-waste.&nbsp; And his light eyes expressed
<BR>bitter distaste, as though our friendship had turned
<BR>to ashes.&nbsp; He said weightily: "Oh!&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; I've
<BR>been thinking it was about time for you to run
<BR>away home and get married to some silly girl."

<P>It was tacitly understood in the port that John
<BR>Nieven was a fierce misogynist; and the absurd
<BR>character of the sally convinced me that he meant
<BR>to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the
<BR>most crushing thing he could think of.&nbsp; My laugh
<BR>sounded deprecatory.&nbsp; Nobody but a friend could
<BR>be so angry as that.&nbsp; I became a little crestfallen.
<BR>Our chief engineer also took a characteristic view
<BR>of my action, but in a kindlier spirit.

<P>He was young, too, but very thin, and with a
<BR>mist of fluffy brown beard all round his haggard
<BR>face.&nbsp; All day long, at sea or in harbour, he could
<BR>be seen walking hastily up and down the after-
<BR>deck, wearing an intense, spiritually rapt ex-
<BR>pression, which was caused by a perpetual con-
<BR>sciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in
<BR>his internal economy.&nbsp; For he was a confirmed
<BR>dyspeptic.&nbsp; His view of my case was very simple.
<BR>He said it was nothing but deranged liver.&nbsp; Of
<BR>course!&nbsp; He suggested I should stay for another
<BR>trip and meantime dose myself with a certain
<BR>patent medicine in which his own belief was ab-
<BR>solute.&nbsp; "I'll tell you what I'll do.&nbsp; I'll buy you
<BR>two bottles, out of my own pocket.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; I
<BR>can't say fairer than that, can I?"

<P>I believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity
<BR>(or generosity) at the merest sign of weakening
<BR>on my part.&nbsp; By that time, however, I was more
<BR>discontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever.
<BR>The past eighteen months, so full of new and varied
<BR>experience, appeared a dreary, prosaic waste of
<BR>days.&nbsp; I felt--how shall I express it?--that there
<BR>was no truth to be got out of them.

<P>What truth?&nbsp; I should have been hard put to it to
<BR>explain.&nbsp; Probably, if pressed, I would have burst
<BR>into tears simply.&nbsp; I was young enough for that.

<P>Next day the Captain and I transacted our busi-
<BR>ness in the Harbour Office.&nbsp; It was a lofty, big,
<BR>cool, white room, where the screened light of day
<BR>glowed serenely.&nbsp; Everybody in it--the officials,
<BR>the public--were in white.&nbsp; Only the heavy
<BR>polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue,
<BR>and some papers lying on them were blue.&nbsp; Enor-
<BR>mous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught
<BR>through that immaculate interior and upon our
<BR>perspiring heads.

<P>The official behind the desk we approached
<BR>grinned amiably and kept it up till, in answer to
<BR>his perfunctory question, "Sign off and on again?"
<BR>my Captain answered, "No!&nbsp; Signing off for good."
<BR>And then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity.
<BR>He did not look at me again till he handed me my
<BR>papers with a sorrowful expression, as if they had
<BR>been my passports for Hades.

<P>While I was putting them away he murmured
<BR>some question to the Captain, and I heard the
<BR>latter answer good-humouredly:

<P>"No.&nbsp; He leaves us to go home."

<P>"Oh!" the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully
<BR>over my sad condition.

<P>I didn't know him outside the official building,
<BR>but he leaned forward the desk to shake hands
<BR>with me, compassionately, as one would with some
<BR>poor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid
<BR>I performed my part ungraciously, in the hardened
<BR>manner of an impenitent criminal.

<P>No homeward-bound mail-boat was due for
<BR>three or four days.&nbsp; Being now a man without a
<BR>ship, and having for a time broken my connection
<BR>with the sea--become, in fact, a mere potential
<BR>passenger--it would have been more appropriate
<BR>perhaps if I had gone to stay at an hotel.&nbsp; There
<BR>it was, too, within a stone's throw of the Harbour
<BR>Office, low, but somehow palatial, displaying its
<BR>white, pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass
<BR>plots.&nbsp; I would have felt a passenger indeed in
<BR>there!&nbsp; I gave it a hostile glance and directed my
<BR>steps toward the Officers' Sailors' Home.

<P>I walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in
<BR>the shade of the big trees on the esplanade without
<BR>enjoying it.&nbsp; The heat of the tropical East de-
<BR>scended through the leafy boughs, enveloping my
<BR>thinly-clad body, clinging to my rebellious dis-
<BR>content, as if to rob it of its freedom.

<P>The Officers' Home was a large bungalow with
<BR>a wide verandah and a curiously suburban-looking
<BR>little garden of bushes and a few trees between it
<BR>and the street.&nbsp; That institution partook some-
<BR>what of the character of a residential club, but
<BR>with a slightly Governmental flavour about it,
<BR>because it was administered by the Harbour Office.
<BR>Its manager was officially styled Chief Steward.
<BR>He was an unhappy, wizened little man, who if put
<BR>into a jockey's rig would have looked the part to
<BR>perfection.&nbsp; But it was obvious that at some time
<BR>or other in his life, in some capacity or other, he
<BR>had been connected with the sea.&nbsp; Possibly in the
<BR>comprehensive capacity of a failure.

<P>I should have thought his employment a very
<BR>easy one, but he used to affirm for some reason or
<BR>other that his job would be the death of him some
<BR>day.&nbsp; It was rather mysterious.&nbsp; Perhaps everything
<BR>naturally was too much trouble for him.&nbsp; He cer-
<BR>tainly seemed to hate having people in the house.

<P>On entering it I thought he must be feeling
<BR>pleased.&nbsp; It was as still as a tomb.&nbsp; I could see no
<BR>one in the living rooms; and the verandah, too,
<BR>was empty, except for a man at the far end dozing
<BR>prone in a long chair.&nbsp; At the noise of my footsteps
<BR>he opened one horribly fish-like eye.&nbsp; He was a
<BR>stranger to me.&nbsp; I retreated from there, and cross-
<BR>ing the dining room--a very bare apartment with
<BR>a motionless punkah hanging over the centre table
<BR>--I knocked at a door labelled in black letters:
<BR>"Chief Steward."

<P>The answer to my knock being a vexed and dole-
<BR>ful plaint: "Oh, dear!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&nbsp; What is it
<BR>now?"&nbsp; I went in at once.

<P>It was a strange room to find in the tropics.
<BR>Twilight and stuffiness reigned in there.&nbsp; The
<BR>fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty, cheap
<BR>lace curtains over his windows, which were shut.
<BR>Piles of cardboard boxes, such as milliners and
<BR>dressmakers use in Europe, cumbered the corners;
<BR>and by some means he had procured for himself
<BR>the sort of furniture that might have come out of
<BR>a respectable parlour in the East End of London
<BR>--a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs of the same.&nbsp; I
<BR>glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that
<BR>horrid upholstery, which was awe-inspiring, in-
<BR>somuch that one could not guess what mysterious
<BR>accident, need, or fancy had collected it there.
<BR>Its owner had taken off his tunic, and in white
<BR>trousers and a thin, short-sleeved singlet prowled
<BR>behind the chair-backs nursing his meagre el-
<BR>bows.

<P>An exclamation of dismay escaped him when he
<BR>heard that I had come for a stay; but he could not
<BR>deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms.

<P>"Very well.&nbsp; Can you give me the one I had
<BR>before?"

<P>He emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of
<BR>cardboard boxes on the table, which might have
<BR>contained gloves or handkerchies or neckties.&nbsp; I
<BR>wonder what the fellow did keep in them?&nbsp; There
<BR>was a smell of decaying coral, or Oriental dust
<BR>of zoological speciments in that den of his.&nbsp; I
<BR>could only see the top of his head and his un-
<BR>happy eyes levelled at me over the barrier.

<P>"It's only for a couple of days," I said, intending
<BR>to cheer him up.

<P>"Perhaps you would like to pay in advance?"
<BR>he suggested eagerly.

<P>"Certainly not!" I burst out directly I could
<BR>speak.&nbsp; "Never heard of such a thing!&nbsp; This is
<BR>the most infernal cheek. . . ."

<P>He had seized his head in both hands--a gesture
<BR>of despair which checked my indignation.

<P>"Oh, dear!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&nbsp; Don't fly out like this.
<BR>I am asking everybody."

<P>"I don't believe it," I said bluntly.

<P>"Well, I am going to.&nbsp; And if you gentlemen
<BR>all agreed to pay in advance I could make Hamil-
<BR>ton pay up, too.&nbsp; He's always turning up ashore
<BR>dead broke, and even when he has some money
<BR>he won't settle his bills.&nbsp; I don't know what to do
<BR>with him.&nbsp; He swears at me and tells me I can't
<BR>chuck a white man out into the street here.&nbsp; So if
<BR>you only would. . . ."

<P>I was amazed.&nbsp; Incredulous, too.&nbsp; I suspected
<BR>the fellow of gratuitous impertinence.&nbsp; I told him
<BR>with marked emphasis that I would see him and
<BR>Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to con-
<BR>duct me to my room with no more of his nonsense.
<BR>He produced then a key from somewhere and led
<BR>the way out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong
<BR>look in passing.

<P>"Any one I know staying here?" I asked him
<BR>before he left my room.

<P>He had recovered his usual pained impatient
<BR>tone, and said that Captain Giles was there, back
<BR>from a Solo Sea trip.&nbsp; Two other guests were stay-
<BR>ing also.&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; And, of course, Hamilton,
<BR>he added.

<P>"Oh, yes!&nbsp; Hamilton," I said, and the miserable
<BR>creature took himself off with a final groan.

<P>His impudence still rankled when I came into the
<BR>dining room at tiffin time.&nbsp; He was there on duty
<BR>overlooking the Chinamen servants.&nbsp; The tiffin
<BR>was laid on one end only of the long table, and the
<BR>punkah was stirring the hot air lazily--mostly
<BR>above a barren waste of polished wood.

<P>We were four around the cloth.&nbsp; The dozing
<BR>stranger from the chair was one.&nbsp; Both his eyes
<BR>were partly opened now, but they did not seem to
<BR>see anything.&nbsp; He was supine.&nbsp; The dignified
<BR>person next him, with short side whiskers and a
<BR>carefully scraped chin, was, of course, Hamilton.
<BR>I have never seen any one so full of dignity for the
<BR>station in life Providence had been pleased to
<BR>place him in.&nbsp; I had been told that he regarded me
<BR>as a rank outsider.&nbsp; He raised not only his eyes,
<BR>but his eyebrows as well, at the sound I made
<BR>pulling back my chair.

<P>Captain Giles was at the head of the table.&nbsp; I
<BR>exchanged a few words of greeting with him and sat
<BR>down on his left.&nbsp; Stout and pale, with a great
<BR>shiny dome of a bald forehead and prominent
<BR>brown eyes, he might have been anything but a
<BR>seaman.&nbsp; You would not have been surprised to
<BR>learn that he was an architect.&nbsp; To me (I know
<BR>how absurd it is) to me he looked like a church-
<BR>warden.&nbsp; He had the appearance of a man from
<BR>whom you would expect sound advice, moral
<BR>sentiments, with perhaps a platitude or two thrown
<BR>in on occasion, not from a desire to dazzle, but
<BR>from honest conviction.

<P>Though very well known and appreciated in the
<BR>shipping world, he had no regular employment.
<BR>He did not want it.&nbsp; He had his own peculiar
<BR>position.&nbsp; He was an expert.&nbsp; An expert in--how
<BR>shall I say it?--in intricate navigation.&nbsp; He was
<BR>supposed to know more about remote and im-
<BR>perfectly charted parts of the Archipelago than any
<BR>man living.&nbsp; His brain must have been a perfect
<BR>warehouse of reefs, positions, bearings, images of
<BR>headlands, shapes of obscure coasts, aspects of
<BR>innumerable islands, desert and otherwise.&nbsp; Any
<BR>ship, for instance, bound on a trip to Palawan or
<BR>somewhere that way would have Captain Giles on
<BR>board, either in temporary command or "to assist
<BR>the master."&nbsp; It was said that he had a retaining
<BR>fee from a wealthy firm of Chinese steamship
<BR>owners, in view of such services.&nbsp; Besides, he was
<BR>always ready to relieve any man who wished to
<BR>take a spell ashore for a time.&nbsp; No owner was ever
<BR>known to object to an arrangement of that sort.
<BR>For it seemed to be the established opinion at the
<BR>port that Captain Giles was as good as the best, if
<BR>not a little better.&nbsp; But in Hamilton's view he was
<BR>an "outsider."&nbsp; I believe that for Hamilton the
<BR>generalisation "outsider" covered the whole lot of
<BR>us; though I suppose that he made some dis-
<BR>tinctions in his mind.

<P>I didn't try to make conversation with Captain
<BR>Giles, whom I had not seen more than twice in
<BR>my life.&nbsp; But, of course, he knew who I was.
<BR>After a while, inclining his big shiny head my way,
<BR>he addressed me first in his friendly fashion.&nbsp; He
<BR>presumed from seeing me there, he said, that I had
<BR>come ashore for a couple of days' leave.

<P>He was a low-voiced man.&nbsp; I spoke a little
<BR>louder, saying that: No--I had left the ship for
<BR>good.

<P>"A free man for a bit," was his comment.

<P>"I suppose I may call myself that--since eleven
<BR>o'clock," I said.

<P>Hamilton had stopped eating at the sound of
<BR>our voices.&nbsp; He laid down his knife and fork gently,
<BR>got up, and muttering something about "this
<BR>infernal heat cutting one's appetite," went out of
<BR>the room.&nbsp; Almost immediately we heard him
<BR>leave the house down the verandah steps.

<P>On this Captain Giles remarked easily that the
<BR>fellow had no doubt gone off to look after my old
<BR>job.&nbsp; The Chief Steward, who had been leaning
<BR>against the wall, brought his face of an unhappy
<BR>goat nearer to the table and addressed us dole-
<BR>fully.&nbsp; His object was to unburden himself of his
<BR>eternal grievance against Hamilton.&nbsp; The man
<BR>kept him in hot water with the Harbour Office as
<BR>to the state of his accounts.&nbsp; He wished to good-
<BR>ness he would get my job, though in truth what
<BR>would it be?&nbsp; Temporary relief at best.

<P>I said: "You needn't worry.&nbsp; He won't get my
<BR>job.&nbsp; My successor is on board already."

<P>He was surprised, and I believe his face fell
<BR>a little at the news.&nbsp; Captain Giles gave a soft
<BR>laugh.&nbsp; We got up and went out on the verandah,
<BR>leaving the supine stranger to be dealt with by
<BR>the Chinamen.&nbsp; The last thing I saw they had put
<BR>a plate with a slice of pine-apple on it before him
<BR>and stood back to watch what would happen.
<BR>But the experiment seemed a failure.&nbsp; He sat in-
<BR>sensible.

<P>It was imparted to me in a low voice by Captain
<BR>Giles that this was an officer of some Rajah's yacht
<BR>which had come into our port to be dry-docked.
<BR>Must have been "seeing life" last night, he added,
<BR>wrinkling his nose in an intimate, confidential way
<BR>which pleased me vastly.&nbsp; For Captain Giles had
<BR>prestige.&nbsp; He was credited with wonderful ad-
<BR>ventures and with some mysterious tragedy in his
<BR>life.&nbsp; And no man had a word to say against him.
<BR>He continued:

<P>"I remember him first coming ashore here some
<BR>years ago.&nbsp; Seems only the other day.&nbsp; He was a
<BR>nice boy.&nbsp; Oh! these nice boys!"

<P>I could not help laughing aloud.&nbsp; He looked
<BR>startled, then joined in the laugh.&nbsp; "No!&nbsp; No!
<BR>I didn't mean that," he cried.&nbsp; "What I meant
<BR>is that some of them do go soft mighty quick out
<BR>here."

<P>Jocularly I suggested the beastly heat as the
<BR>first cause.&nbsp; But Captain Giles disclosed himself
<BR>possessed of a deeper philosophy.&nbsp; Things out
<BR>East were made easy for white men.&nbsp; That was
<BR>all right.&nbsp; The difficulty was to go on keeping
<BR>white, and some of these nice boys did not know
<BR>how.&nbsp; He gave me a searching look, and in a
<BR>benevolent, heavy-uncle manner asked point blank:

<P>"Why did you throw up your berth?"

<P>I became angry all of a sudden; for you can
<BR>understand how exasperating such a question was
<BR>to a man who didn't know.&nbsp; I said to myself that
<BR>I ought to shut up that moralist; and to him
<BR>aloud I said with challenging politeness:

<P>"Why . . . ?&nbsp; Do you disapprove?"

<P>He was too disconcerted to do more than mutter
<BR>confusedly: "I! . . .&nbsp; In a general way.
<BR>. . ." and then gave me up.&nbsp; But he retired in
<BR>good order, under the cover of a heavily humorous
<BR>remark that he, too, was getting soft, and that this
<BR>was his time for taking his little siesta--when he
<BR>was on shore.&nbsp; "Very bad habit.&nbsp; Very bad
<BR>habit."

<P>There was a simplicity in the man which would
<BR>have disarmed a touchiness even more youthful
<BR>than mine.&nbsp; So when next day at tiffin he bent his
<BR>head toward me and said that he had met my
<BR>late Captain last evening, adding in an undertone:
<BR>"He's very sorry you left.&nbsp; He had never had a
<BR>mate that suited him so well," I answered him
<BR>earnestly, without any affectation, that I certainly
<BR>hadn't been so comfortable in any ship or with any
<BR>commander in all my sea-going days.

<P>"Well--then," he murmured.

<P>"Haven't you heard, Captain Giles, that I in-
<BR>tend to go home?"

<P>"Yes," he said benevolently.&nbsp; "I have heard
<BR>that sort of thing so often before."

<P>"What of that?" I cried.&nbsp; I thought he was the
<BR>most dull, unimaginative man I had ever met.&nbsp; I
<BR>don't know what more I would have said, but
<BR>the much-belated Hamilton came in just then
<BR>and took his usual seat.&nbsp; So I dropped into a mum-
<BR>ble.

<P>"Anyhow, you shall see it done this time."

<P>Hamilton, beautifully shaved, gave Captain
<BR>Giles a curt nod, but didn't even condescend to
<BR>raise his eyebrows at me; and when he spoke it was
<BR>only to tell the Chief Steward that the food on his
<BR>plate wasn't fit to be set before a gentleman.&nbsp; The
<BR>individual addressed seemed much too unhappy to
<BR>groan.&nbsp; He cast his eyes up to the punkah and
<BR>that was all.

<P>Captain Giles and I got up from the table, and
<BR>the stranger next to Hamilton followed our ex-
<BR>ample, manoeuvring himself to his feet with
<BR>difficulty.&nbsp; He, poor fellow, not because he was
<BR>hungry but I verily believe only to recover his
<BR>self-respect, had tried to put some of that un-
<BR>worthy food into his mouth.&nbsp; But after dropping
<BR>his fork twice and generally making a failure of
<BR>it, he had sat still with an air of intense mortifica-
<BR>tion combined with a ghastly glazed stare.&nbsp; Both
<BR>Giles and I had avoided looking his way at
<BR>table.

<P>On the verandah he stopped short on purpose to
<BR>address to us anxiously a long remark which I
<BR>failed to understand completely.&nbsp; It sounded like
<BR>some horrible unknown language.&nbsp; But when
<BR>Captain Giles, after only an instant for reflection,
<BR>assured him with homely friendliness, "Aye, to be
<BR>sure.&nbsp; You are right there," he appeared very
<BR>much gratified indeed, and went away (pretty
<BR>straight, too) to seek a distant long chair.

<P>"What was he trying to say?" I asked with
<BR>disgust.

<P>"I don't know.&nbsp; Mustn't be down too much on
<BR>a fellow.&nbsp; He's feeling pretty wretched, you may
<BR>be sure; and to-morrow he'll feel worse yet."

<P>Judging by the man's appearance it seemed im-
<BR>possible.&nbsp; I wondered what sort of complicated de-
<BR>bauch had reduced him to that unspeakable con-
<BR>dition.&nbsp; Captain Giles' benevolence was spoiled by
<BR>a curious air of complacency which I disliked.&nbsp; I
<BR>said with a little laugh:

<P>"Well, he will have you to look after him."
<BR>He made a deprecatory gesture, sat down, and
<BR>took up a paper.&nbsp; I did the same.&nbsp; The papers
<BR>were old and uninteresting, filled up mostly with
<BR>dreary stereotyped descriptions of Queen Victoria's
<BR>first jubilee celebrations.&nbsp; Probably we should
<BR>have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze
<BR>if it had not been for Hamilton's voice raised in
<BR>the dining room.&nbsp; He was finishing his tiffin there.
<BR>The big double doors stood wide open permanently,
<BR>and he could not have had any idea how near to the
<BR>doorway our chairs were placed.&nbsp; He was heard in
<BR>a loud, supercilious tone answering some state-
<BR>ment ventured by the Chief Steward.

<P>"I am not going to be rushed into anything.
<BR>They will be glad enough to get a gentleman I
<BR>imagine.&nbsp; There is no hurry."

<P>A loud whispering from the Steward succeeded
<BR>and then again Hamilton was heard with even
<BR>intenser scorn.

<P>"What?&nbsp; That young ass who fancies himself
<BR>for having been chief mate with Kent so long?
<BR>. . .&nbsp; Preposterous."

<P>Giles and I looked at each other.&nbsp; Kent being
<BR>the came of my late commander, Captain Giles'
<BR>whisper, "He's talking of you," seemed to me sheer
<BR>waste of breath.&nbsp; The Chief Steward must have
<BR>stuck to his point, whatever it was, because Hamil-
<BR>ton was heard again more supercilious if possible,
<BR>and also very emphatic:

<P>"Rubbish, my good man!&nbsp; One doesn't COMPETE with
<BR>a rank outsider like that.&nbsp; There's plenty of time."

<P>Then there were pushing of chairs, footsteps in
<BR>the next room, and plaintive expostulations from
<BR>the Steward, who was pursuing Hamilton, even out
<BR>of doors through the main entrance.

<P>"That's a very insulting sort of man," remarked
<BR>Captain Giles--superfluously, I thought.&nbsp; "Very
<BR>insulting.&nbsp; You haven't offended him in some way,
<BR>have you?"

<P>"Never spoke to him in my life," I said grumpily.
<BR>"Can't imagine what he means by competing.&nbsp; He
<BR>has been trying for my job after I left--and didn't
<BR>get it.&nbsp; But that isn't exactly competition."

<P>Captain Giles balanced his big benevolent head
<BR>thoughtfully.&nbsp; "He didn't get it," he repeated
<BR>very slowly.&nbsp; "No, not likely either, with Kent.
<BR>Kent is no end sorry you left him.&nbsp; He gives you
<BR>the name of a good seaman, too."

<P>I flung away the paper I was still holding.&nbsp; I sat
<BR>up, I slapped the table with my open palm.&nbsp; I
<BR>wanted to know why he would keep harping on
<BR>that, my absolutely private affair.&nbsp; It was exas-
<BR>perating, really.

<P>Captain Giles silenced me by the perfect
<BR>equanimity of his gaze.&nbsp; "Nothing to be annoyed
<BR>about," he murmured reasonably, with an evident
<BR>desire to soothe the childish irritation he had
<BR>aroused.&nbsp; And he was really a man of an appear-
<BR>ance so inoffensive that I tried to explain myself
<BR>as much as I could.&nbsp; I told him that I did not want
<BR>to hear any more about what was past and gone.
<BR>It had been very nice while it lasted, but now it
<BR>was done with I preferred not to talk about it or
<BR>even think about it.&nbsp; I had made up my mind to go
<BR>home.

<P>He listened to the whole tirade in a particular
<BR>lending-the-ear attitude, as if trying to detect a
<BR>false note in it somewhere; then straightened him-
<BR>self up and appeared to ponder sagaciously over
<BR>the matter.

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; You told me you meant to go home.
<BR>Anything in view there?"

<P>Instead of telling him that it was none of his
<BR>business I said sullenly:

<P>"Nothing that I know of."

<P>I had indeed considered that rather blank side of
<BR>the situation I had created for myself by leaving
<BR>suddenly my very satisfactory employment.&nbsp; And
<BR>I was not very pleased with it.&nbsp; I had it on the tip
<BR>of my tongue to say that common sense had noth-
<BR>ing to do with my action, and that therefore it
<BR>didn't deserve the interest Captain Giles seemed
<BR>to be taking in it.&nbsp; But he was puffing at a short
<BR>wooden pipe now, and looked so guileless, dense,
<BR>and commonplace, that it seemed hardly worth
<BR>while to puzzle him either with truth or sarcasm.

<P>He blew a cloud of smoke, then surprised me
<BR>by a very abrupt: "Paid your passage money
<BR>yet?"

<P>Overcome by the shameless pertinacity of a
<BR>man to whom it was rather difficult to be rude,
<BR>I replied with exaggerated meekness that I had
<BR>not done so yet.&nbsp; I thought there would be plenty
<BR>of time to do that to-morrow.

<P>And I was about to turn away, withdrawing
<BR>my privacy from his fatuous, objectless attempts
<BR>to test what sort of stuff it was made of, when he
<BR>laid down his pipe in an extremely significant
<BR>manner, you know, as if a critical moment had
<BR>come, and leaned sideways over the table be-
<BR>tween us.

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; You haven't yet!"&nbsp; He dropped his
<BR>voice mysteriously.&nbsp; "Well, then I think you
<BR>ought to know that there's something going on
<BR>here."

<P>I had never in my life felt more detached from
<BR>all earthly goings on.&nbsp; Freed from the sea for a
<BR>time, I preserved the sailor's consciousness of
<BR>complete independence from all land affairs.
<BR>How could they concern me?&nbsp; I gazed at Captain
<BR>Giles' animation with scorn rather than with
<BR>curiosity.

<P>To his obviously preparatory question whether
<BR>our Steward had spoken to me that day I said he
<BR>hadn't.&nbsp; And what's more he would have had
<BR>precious little encouragement if he had tried to.
<BR>I didn't want the fellow to speak to me at all.

<P>Unrebuked by my petulance, Captain Giles,
<BR>with an air of immense sagacity, began to tell me
<BR>a minute tale about a Harbour Office peon.&nbsp; It
<BR>was absolutely pointless.&nbsp; A peon was seen walk-
<BR>ing that morning on the verandah with a letter
<BR>in his hand.&nbsp; It was in an official envelope.&nbsp; As
<BR>the habit of these fellows is, he had shown it
<BR>to the first white man he came across.&nbsp; That man
<BR>was our friend in the arm-chair.&nbsp; He, as I knew,
<BR>was not in a state to interest himself in any sub-
<BR>lunary matters.&nbsp; He could only wave the peon
<BR>away.&nbsp; The peon then wandered on along the
<BR>verandah and came upon Captain Giles, who
<BR>was there by an extraordinary chance. . . .

<P>At this point he stopped with a profound look.
<BR>The letter, he continued, was addressed to the
<BR>Chief Steward.&nbsp; Now what could Captain Ellis,
<BR>the Master Attendant, want to write to the
<BR>Steward for?&nbsp; The fellow went every morning,
<BR>anyhow, to the Harbour Office with his report,
<BR>for orders or what not.&nbsp; He hadn't been back
<BR>more than an hour before there was an office
<BR>peon chasing him with a note.&nbsp; Now what was
<BR>that for?

<P>And he began to speculate.&nbsp; It was not for this
<BR>--and it could not be for that.&nbsp; As to that other
<BR>thing it was unthinkable.

<P>The fatuousness of all this made me stare.&nbsp; If
<BR>the man had not been somehow a sympathetic
<BR>personality I would have resented it like an in-
<BR>sult.&nbsp; As it was, I felt only sorry for him.&nbsp; Some-
<BR>thing remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented
<BR>me from laughing in his face.&nbsp; Neither did I
<BR>yawn at him.&nbsp; I just stared.

<P>His tone became a shade more mysterious.
<BR>Directly the fellow (meaning the Steward) got
<BR>that note he rushed for his hat and bolted out of
<BR>the house.&nbsp; But it wasn't because the note called
<BR>him to the Harbour Office.&nbsp; He didn't go there.
<BR>He was not absent long enough for that.&nbsp; He came
<BR>darting back in no time, flung his hat away, and
<BR>raced about the dining room moaning and slapping
<BR>his forehead.&nbsp; All these exciting facts and mani-
<BR>festations had been observed by Captain Giles.
<BR>He had, it seems, been meditating upon them
<BR>ever since.

<P>I began to pity him profoundly.&nbsp; And in a
<BR>tone which I tried to make as little sarcastic as
<BR>possible I said that I was glad he had found
<BR>something to occupy his morning hours.

<P>With his disarming simplicity he made me ob-
<BR>serve, as if it were a matter of some consequence,
<BR>how strange it was that he should have spent
<BR>the morning indoors at all.&nbsp; He generally was
<BR>out before tiffin, visiting various offices, seeing his
<BR>friends in the harbour, and so on.&nbsp; He had felt
<BR>out of sorts somewhat on rising.&nbsp; Nothing much.
<BR>Just enough to make him feel lazy.

<P>All this with a sustained, holding stare which,
<BR>in conjunction with the general inanity of the
<BR>discourse, conveyed the impression of mild, dreary
<BR>lunacy.&nbsp; And when he hitched his chair a little
<BR>and dropped his voice to the low note of mystery,
<BR>it flashed upon me that high professional reputa-
<BR>tion was not necessarily a guarantee of sound
<BR>mind.

<P>It never occurred to me then that I didn't
<BR>know in what soundness of mind exactly con-
<BR>sisted and what a delicate and, upon the whole,
<BR>unimportant matter it was.&nbsp; With some idea of
<BR>not hurting his feelings I blinked at him in an
<BR>interested manner.&nbsp; But when he proceeded to
<BR>ask me mysteriously whether I remembered what
<BR>had passed just now between that Steward of
<BR>ours and "that man Hamilton," I only grunted
<BR>sourly assent and turned away my head.

<P>"Aye.&nbsp; But do you remember every word?" he
<BR>insisted tactfully.

<P>"I don't know.&nbsp; It's none of my business," I
<BR>snapped out, consigning, moreover, the Steward
<BR>and Hamilton aloud to eternal perdition.

<P>I meant to be very energetic and final, but
<BR>Captain Giles continued to gaze at me thought-
<BR>fully.&nbsp; Nothing could stop him.&nbsp; He went on to
<BR>point out that my personality was involved in
<BR>that conversation.&nbsp; When I tried to preserve the
<BR>semblance of unconcern he became positively
<BR>cruel.&nbsp; I heard what the man had said?&nbsp; Yes?
<BR>What did I think of it then?--he wanted to know.

<P>Captain Giles' appearance excluding the sus-
<BR>picion of mere sly malice, I came to the conclusion
<BR>that he was simply the most tactless idiot on earth.
<BR>I almost despised myself for the weakness of
<BR>attempting to enlighten his common understand-
<BR>ing.&nbsp; I started to explain that I did not think
<BR>anything whatever.&nbsp; Hamilton was not worth a
<BR>thought.&nbsp; What such an offensive loafer . . .
<BR>"Aye! that he is," interjected Captain Giles
<BR>. . . thought or said was below any decent
<BR>man's contempt, and I did not propose to take
<BR>the slightest notice of it.

<P>This attitude seemed to me so simple and ob-
<BR>vious that I was really astonished at Giles giving
<BR>no sign of assent.&nbsp; Such perfect stupidity was
<BR>almost interesting.

<P>"What would you like me to do?" I asked,
<BR>laughing.&nbsp; "I can't start a row with him because
<BR>of the opinion he has formed of me.&nbsp; Of course,
<BR>I've heard of the contemptuous way he alludes
<BR>to me.&nbsp; But he doesn't intrude his contempt on
<BR>my notice.&nbsp; He has never expressed it in my
<BR>hearing.&nbsp; For even just now he didn't know we
<BR>could hear him.&nbsp; I should only make myself
<BR>ridiculous."

<P>That hopeless Giles went on puffing at his pipe
<BR>moodily.&nbsp; All at once his face cleared, and he spoke.

<P>"You missed my point."

<P>"Have I?&nbsp; I am very glad to hear it," I said.

<P>With increasing animation he stated again
<BR>that I had missed his point.&nbsp; Entirely.&nbsp; And in a
<BR>tone of growing self-conscious complacency he
<BR>told me that few things escaped his attention,
<BR>and he was rather used to think them out, and
<BR>generally from his experience of life and men ar-
<BR>rived at the right conclusion.

<P>This bit of self-praise, of course, fitted excel-
<BR>lently the laborious inanity of the whole conversa-
<BR>tion.&nbsp; The whole thing strengthened in me that
<BR>obscure feeling of life being but a waste of days,
<BR>which, half-unconsciously, had driven me out of
<BR>a comfortable berth, away from men I liked, to
<BR>flee from the menace of emptiness . . . and
<BR>to find inanity at the first turn.&nbsp; Here was a man
<BR>of recognized character and achievement disclosed
<BR>as an absurd and dreary chatterer.&nbsp; And it was
<BR>probably like this everywhere--from east to west,
<BR>from the bottom to the top of the social scale.

<P>A great discouragement fell on me.&nbsp; A spiritual
<BR>drowsiness.&nbsp; Giles' voice was going on compla-
<BR>cently; the very voice of the universal hollow
<BR>conceit.&nbsp; And I was no longer angry with it.
<BR>There was nothing original, nothing new, star-
<BR>tling, informing, to expect from the world; no op-
<BR>portunities to find out something about oneself,
<BR>no wisdom to acquire, no fun to enjoy.&nbsp; Every-
<BR>thing was stupid and overrated, even as Captain
<BR>Giles was.&nbsp; So be it.

<P>The name of Hamilton suddenly caught my
<BR>ear and roused me up.

<P>"I thought we had done with him," I said, with
<BR>the greatest possible distaste.

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; But considering what we happened to
<BR>hear just now I think you ought to do it."

<P>"Ought to do it?"&nbsp; I sat up bewildered.&nbsp; "Do
<BR>what?"

<P>Captain Giles confronted me very much sur-
<BR>prised.

<P>"Why!&nbsp; Do what I have been advising you to
<BR>try.&nbsp; You go and ask the Steward what was there
<BR>in that letter from the Harbour Office.&nbsp; Ask him
<BR>straight out."

<P>I remained speechless for a time.&nbsp; Here was
<BR>something unexpected and original enough to be
<BR>altogether incomprehensible.&nbsp; I murmured, as-
<BR>tounded:

<P>"But I thought it was Hamilton that you . . ."

<P>"Exactly.&nbsp; Don't you let him.&nbsp; You do what I
<BR>tell you.&nbsp; You tackle that Steward.&nbsp; You'll make
<BR>him jump, I bet," insisted Captain Giles, waving
<BR>his smouldering pipe impressively at me.&nbsp; Then
<BR>he took three rapid puffs at it.

<P>His aspect of triumphant acuteness was inde-
<BR>scribable.&nbsp; Yet the man remained a strangely
<BR>sympathetic creature.&nbsp; Benevolence radiated from
<BR>him ridiculously, mildly, impressively.&nbsp; It was
<BR>irritating, too.&nbsp; But I pointed out coldly, as one
<BR>who deals with the incomprehensible, that I
<BR>didn't see any reason to expose myself to a snub
<BR>from the fellow.&nbsp; He was a very unsatisfactory
<BR>steward and a miserable wretch besides, but I
<BR>would just as soon think of tweaking his nose.

<P>"Tweaking his nose," said Captain Giles in a
<BR>scandalized tone.&nbsp; "Much use it would be to
<BR>you."

<P>That remark was so irrelevant that one could
<BR>make no answer to it.&nbsp; But the sense of the ab-
<BR>surdity was beginning at last to exercise its well-
<BR>known fascination.&nbsp; I felt I must not let the
<BR>man talk to me any more.&nbsp; I got up, observing
<BR>curtly that he was too much for me--that I
<BR>couldn't make him out.

<P>Before I had time to move away he spoke
<BR>again in a changed tone of obstinacy and puffing
<BR>nervously at his pipe.

<P>"Well--he's a--no account cuss--anyhow.
<BR>You just--ask him.&nbsp; That's all."

<P>That new manner impressed me--or rather
<BR>made me pause.&nbsp; But sanity asserting its sway
<BR>at once I left the verandah after giving him a
<BR>mirthless smile.&nbsp; In a few strides I found myself
<BR>in the dining room, now cleared and empty.&nbsp; But
<BR>during that short time various thoughts occurred
<BR>to me, such as: that Giles had been making fun
<BR>of me, expecting some amusement at my expense;
<BR>that I probably looked silly and gullible; that I
<BR>knew very little of life. . . .

<P>The door facing me across the dining room flew
<BR>open to my extreme surprise.&nbsp; It was the door
<BR>inscribed with the word "Steward" and the man
<BR>himself ran out of his stuffy, Philistinish lair in
<BR>his absurd, hunted-animal manner, making for the
<BR>garden door.

<P>To this day I don't know what made me call
<BR>after him.&nbsp; "I say!&nbsp; Wait a minute."&nbsp; Perhaps
<BR>it was the sidelong glance he gave me; or possibly
<BR>I was yet under the influence of Captain Giles'
<BR>mysterious earnestness.&nbsp; Well, it was an impulse
<BR>of some sort; an effect of that force somewhere
<BR>within our lives which shapes them this way or
<BR>that.&nbsp; For if these words had not escaped from my
<BR>lips (my will had nothing to do with that) my
<BR>existence would, to be sure, have been still a sea-
<BR>man's existence, but directed on now to me utterly
<BR>inconceivable lines.

<P>No.&nbsp; My will had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; In-
<BR>deed, no sooner had I made that fateful noise
<BR>than I became extremely sorry for it.&nbsp; Had the
<BR>man stopped and faced me I would have had to
<BR>retire in disorder.&nbsp; For I had no notion to carry
<BR>out Captain Giles' idiotic joke, either at my own
<BR>expense or at the expense of the Steward.

<P>But here the old human instinct of the chase
<BR>came into play.&nbsp; He pretended to be deaf, and I,
<BR>without thinking a second about it, dashed along
<BR>my own side of the dining table and cut him off
<BR>at the very door.

<P>"Why can't you answer when you are spoken
<BR>to?" I asked roughly.

<P>He leaned against the lintel of the door.&nbsp; He
<BR>looked extremely wretched.&nbsp; Human nature is, I
<BR>fear, not very nice right through.&nbsp; There are ugly
<BR>spots in it.&nbsp; I found myself growing angry, and
<BR>that, I believe, only because my quarry looked
<BR>so woe-begone.&nbsp; Miserable beggar!

<P>I went for him without more ado.&nbsp; "I under-
<BR>stand there was an official communication to the
<BR>Home from the Harbour Office this morning.&nbsp; Is
<BR>that so?"

<P>Instead of telling me to mind my own business,
<BR>as he might have done, he began to whine with
<BR>an undertone of impudence.&nbsp; He couldn't see me
<BR>anywhere this morning.&nbsp; He couldn't be expected
<BR>to run all over the town after me.

<P>"Who wants you to?" I cried.&nbsp; And then my
<BR>eyes became opened to the inwardness of things
<BR>and speeches the triviality of which had been so
<BR>baffling and tiresome.

<P>I told him I wanted to know what was in that
<BR>letter.&nbsp; My sternness of tone and behaviour was
<BR>only half assumed.&nbsp; Curiosity can be a very fierce
<BR>sentiment--at times.

<P>He took refuge in a silly, muttering sulkiness.
<BR>It was nothing to me, he mumbled.&nbsp; I had told
<BR>him I was going home.&nbsp; And since I was going
<BR>home he didn't see why he should. . . .

<P>That was the line of his argument, and it was
<BR>irrelevant enough to be almost insulting.&nbsp; Insult-
<BR>ing to one's intelligence, I mean.

<P>In that twilight region between youth and
<BR>maturity, in which I had my being then, one is
<BR>peculiarly sensitive to that kind of insult.&nbsp; I am
<BR>afraid my behaviour to the Steward became very
<BR>rough indeed.&nbsp; But it wasn't in him to face out
<BR>anything or anybody.&nbsp; Drug habit or solitary
<BR>tippling, perhaps.&nbsp; And when I forgot myself so
<BR>far as to swear at him he broke down and began to
<BR>shriek.

<P>I don't mean to say that he made a great out-
<BR>cry.&nbsp; It was a cynical shrieking confession, only
<BR>faint--piteously faint.&nbsp; It wasn't very coherent
<BR>either, but sufficiently so to strike me dumb at first.
<BR>I turned my eyes from him in righteous indig-
<BR>nation, and perceived Captain Giles in the ve-
<BR>randah doorway surveying quietly the scene, his
<BR>own handiwork, if I may express it in that way.
<BR>His smouldering black pipe was very noticeable
<BR>in his big, paternal fist.&nbsp; So, too, was the glitter of
<BR>his heavy gold watch-chain across the breast of his
<BR>white tunic.&nbsp; He exhaled an atmosphere of virtu-
<BR>ous sagacity serene enough for any innocent soul to
<BR>fly to confidently.&nbsp; I flew to him.

<P>"You would never believe it," I cried.&nbsp; "It was
<BR>a notification that a master is wanted for some
<BR>ship.&nbsp; There's a command apparently going about
<BR>and this fellow puts the thing in his pocket."

<P>The Steward screamed out in accents of loud
<BR>despair: "You will be the death of me!"

<P>The mighty slap he gave his wretched forehead
<BR>was very loud, too.&nbsp; But when I turned to look at
<BR>him he was no longer there.&nbsp; He had rushed away
<BR>somewhere out of sight.&nbsp; This sudden disappear-
<BR>ance made me laugh.

<P>This was the end of the incident--for me.
<BR>Captain Giles, however, staring at the place where
<BR>the Steward had been, began to haul at his gor-
<BR>geous gold chain till at last the watch came up
<BR>from the deep pocket like solid truth from a well.
<BR>Solemnly he lowered it down again and only then
<BR>said:

<P>"Just three o'clock.&nbsp; You will be in time--if
<BR>you don't lose any, that is."

<P>"In time for what?" I asked.

<P>"Good Lord!&nbsp; For the Harbour Office.&nbsp; This
<BR>must be looked into.

<P>Strictly speaking, he was right.&nbsp; But I've never
<BR>had much taste for investigation, for showing
<BR>people up and all that no doubt ethically meri-
<BR>torious kind of work.&nbsp; And my view of the episode
<BR>was purely ethical.&nbsp; If any one had to be the death
<BR>of the Steward I didn't see why it shouldn't be
<BR>Captain Giles himself, a man of age and standing,
<BR>and a permanent resident.&nbsp; Whereas, I in com-
<BR>parison, felt myself a mere bird of passage in that
<BR>port.&nbsp; In fact, it might have been said that I had
<BR>already broken off my connection.&nbsp; I muttered
<BR>that I didn't think--it was nothing to me. . . .

<P>"Nothing!" repeated Captain Giles, giving some
<BR>signs of quiet, deliberate indignation.&nbsp; "Kent
<BR>warned me you were a peculiar young fellow.&nbsp; You
<BR>will tell me next that a command is nothing to you
<BR>--and after all the trouble I've taken, too!"

<P>"The trouble!" I murmured, uncomprehending.
<BR>What trouble?&nbsp; All I could remember was being
<BR>mystified and bored by his conversation for a solid
<BR>hour after tiffin.&nbsp; And he called that taking a lot
<BR>of trouble.

<P>He was looking at me with a self-complacency
<BR>which would have been odious in any other man.
<BR>All at once, as if a page of a book had been turned
<BR>over disclosing a word which made plain all that
<BR>had gone before, I perceived that this matter had
<BR>also another than an ethical aspect.

<P>And still I did not move.&nbsp; Captain Giles lost his
<BR>patience a little.&nbsp; With an angry puff at his pipe he
<BR>turned his back on my hesitation.

<P>But it was not hesitation on my part.&nbsp; I had
<BR>been, if I may express myself so, put out of gear
<BR>mentally.&nbsp; But as soon as I had convinced my-
<BR>self that this stale, unprofitable world of my dis-
<BR>content contained such a thing as a command
<BR>to be seized, I recovered my powers of locomo-
<BR>tion.

<P>It's a good step from the Officers' Home to the
<BR>Harbour Office; but with the magic word "Com-
<BR>mand" in my head I found myself suddenly on
<BR>the quay as if transported there in the twinkling of
<BR>an eye, before a portal of dressed white stone above
<BR>a flight of shallow white steps.

<P>All this seemed to glide toward me swiftly.&nbsp; The
<BR>whole great roadstead to the right was just a mere
<BR>flicker of blue, and the dim cool hall swallowed
<BR>me up out of the heat and glare of which I had not
<BR>been aware till the very moment I passed in from it.

<P>The broad inner staircase insinuated itself under
<BR>my feet somehow.&nbsp; Command is a strong magic.
<BR>The first human beings I perceived distinctly since
<BR>I had parted with the indignant back of Captain
<BR>Giles were the crew of the harbour steam-launch
<BR>lounging on the spacious landing about the cur-
<BR>tained archway of the shipping office.

<P>It was there that my buoyancy abandoned me.
<BR>The atmosphere of officialdom would kill anything
<BR>that breathes the air of human endeavour, would
<BR>extinguish hope and fear alike in the supremacy of
<BR>paper and ink.&nbsp; I passed heavily under the curtain
<BR>which the Malay coxswain of the harbour launch
<BR>raised for me.&nbsp; There was nobody in the office
<BR>except the clerks, writing in two industrious rows.
<BR>But the head Shipping-Master hopped down from
<BR>his elevation and hurried along on the thick mats
<BR>to meet me in the broad central passage.

<P>He had a Scottish name, but his complexion was
<BR>of a rich olive hue, his short beard was jet black,
<BR>and his eyes, also black, had a languishing ex-
<BR>pression.&nbsp; He asked confidentially:

<P>"You want to see Him?"

<P>All lightness of spirit and body having departed
<BR>from me at the touch of officialdom, I looked at
<BR>the scribe without animation and asked in my turn
<BR>wearily:

<P>"What do you think?&nbsp; Is it any use?"

<P>"My goodness!&nbsp; He has asked for you twice to-
<BR>day."

<P>This emphatic He was the supreme authority,
<BR>the Marine Superintendent, the Harbour-Master
<BR>--a very great person in the eyes of every single
<BR>quill-driver in the room.&nbsp; But that was nothing to
<BR>the opinion he had of his own greatness.

<P>Captain Ellis looked upon himself as a sort of
<BR>divine (pagan) emanation, the deputy-Neptune for
<BR>the circumambient seas.&nbsp; If he did not actually
<BR>rule the waves, he pretended to rule the fate of
<BR>the mortals whose lives were cast upon the
<BR>waters.

<P>This uplifting illusion made him inquisitorial
<BR>and peremptory.&nbsp; And as his temperament was
<BR>choleric there were fellows who were actually afraid
<BR>of him.&nbsp; He was redoubtable, not in virtue of his
<BR>office, but because of his unwarrantable assump-
<BR>tions.&nbsp; I had never had anything to do with him
<BR>before.

<P>I said: "Oh!&nbsp; He has asked for me twice.&nbsp; Then
<BR>perhaps I had better go in."

<P>"You must!&nbsp; You must!"

<P>The Shipping-Master led the way with a mincing
<BR>gait around the whole system of desks to a tall and
<BR>important-looking door, which he opened with a
<BR>deferential action of the arm.

<P>He stepped right in (but without letting go of
<BR>the handle) and, after gazing reverently down the
<BR>room for a while, beckoned me in by a silent jerk
<BR>of the head.&nbsp; Then he slipped out at once and shut
<BR>the door after me most delicately.

<P>Three lofty windows gave on the harbour.
<BR>There was nothing in them but the dark-blue
<BR>sparkling sea and the paler luminous blue of the
<BR>sky.&nbsp; My eye caught in the depths and distances
<BR>of these blue tones the white speck of some big ship
<BR>just arrived and about to anchor in the outer road-
<BR>stead.&nbsp; A ship from home--after perhaps ninety
<BR>days at sea.&nbsp; There is something touching about a
<BR>ship coming in from sea and folding her white
<BR>wings for a rest.

<P>The next thing I saw was the top-knot of silver
<BR>hair surmounting Captain Ellis' smooth red face,
<BR>which would have been apoplectic if it hadn't had
<BR>such a fresh appearance.

<P>Our deputy-Neptune had no beard on his chin,
<BR>and there was no trident to be seen standing in a
<BR>corner anywhere, like an umbrella.&nbsp; But his hand
<BR>was holding a pen--the official pen, far mightier
<BR>than the sword in making or marring the fortune of
<BR>simple toiling men.&nbsp; He was looking over his
<BR>shoulder at my advance.

<P>When I had come well within range he saluted
<BR>me by a nerve-shattering: "Where have you been
<BR>all this time?"

<P>As it was no concern of his I did not take the
<BR>slightest notice of the shot.&nbsp; I said simply that I
<BR>had heard there was a master needed for some
<BR>vessel, and being a sailing-ship man I thought I
<BR>would apply. . . .

<P>He interrupted me.&nbsp; "Why!&nbsp; Hang it!&nbsp; YOU are
<BR>the right man for that job--if there had been
<BR>twenty others after it.&nbsp; But no fear of that.&nbsp; They
<BR>are all afraid to catch hold.&nbsp; That's what's the
<BR>matter."

<P>He was very irritated.&nbsp; I said innocently: "Are
<BR>they, sir.&nbsp; I wonder why?"

<P>"Why!" he fumed.&nbsp; "Afraid of the sails.
<BR>Afraid of a white crew.&nbsp; Too much trouble.&nbsp; Too
<BR>much work.&nbsp; Too long out here.&nbsp; Easy life and
<BR>deck-chairs more their mark.&nbsp; Here I sit with the
<BR>Consul-General's cable before me, and the only
<BR>man fit for the job not to be found anywhere.&nbsp; I
<BR>began to think you were funking it, too. . . ."

<P>"I haven't been long getting to the office," I
<BR>remarked calmly.

<P>"You have a good name out here, though," he
<BR>growled savagely without looking at me.

<P>"I am very glad to hear it from you, sir," I said.

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; But you are not on the spot when you
<BR>are wanted.&nbsp; You know you weren't.&nbsp; That stew-
<BR>ard of yours wouldn't dare to neglect a message
<BR>from this office.&nbsp; Where the devil did you hide
<BR>yourself for the best part of the day?"

<P>I only smiled kindly down on him, and he seemed
<BR>to recollect himself, and asked me to take a seat.&nbsp; He
<BR>explained that the master of a British ship having
<BR>died in Bangkok the Consul-General had cabled to
<BR>him a request for a competent man to be sent out to
<BR>take command.

<P>Apparently, in his mind, I was the man from the
<BR>first, though for the looks of the thing the notifica-
<BR>tion addressed to the Sailors' Home was general.
<BR>An agreement had already been prepared.&nbsp; He
<BR>gave it to me to read, and when I handed it back to
<BR>him with the remark that I accepted its terms, the
<BR>deputy-Neptune signed it, stamped it with his own
<BR>exalted hand, folded it in four (it was a sheet of
<BR>blue foolscap) and presented it to me--a gift of ex-
<BR>traordinary potency, for, as I put it in my pocket,
<BR>my head swam a little.

<P>"This is your appointment to the command," he
<BR>said with a certain gravity.&nbsp; "An official appoint-
<BR>ment binding the owners to conditions which you
<BR>have accepted.&nbsp; Now--when will you be ready to
<BR>go?"

<P>I said I would be ready that very day if neces-
<BR>sary.&nbsp; He caught me at my word with great
<BR>alacrity.&nbsp; The steamer Melita was leaving for
<BR>Bangkok that evening about seven.&nbsp; He would
<BR>request her captain officially to give me a passage
<BR>and wait for me till ten o'clock.

<P>Then he rose from his office chair, and I got up,
<BR>too.&nbsp; My head swam, there was no doubt about it,
<BR>and I felt a certain heaviness of limbs as if they
<BR>had grown bigger since I had sat down on that
<BR>chair.&nbsp; I made my bow.

<P>A subtle change in Captain Ellis' manner became
<BR>perceptible as though he had laid aside the trident
<BR>of deputy-Neptune.&nbsp; In reality, it was only his
<BR>official pen that he had dropped on getting up.
