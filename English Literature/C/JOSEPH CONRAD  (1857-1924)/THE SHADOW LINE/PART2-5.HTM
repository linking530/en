<P>I HEARD the clatter of the scissors escaping from
<BR>his hand, noted the perilous heave of his whole
<BR>person over the edge of the bunk after them, and
<BR>then, returning to my first purpose, pursued my
<BR>course on the deck.&nbsp; The sparkle of the sea filled
<BR>my eyes.&nbsp; It was gorgeous and barren, monotonous
<BR>and without hope under the empty curve of the
<BR>sky.&nbsp; The sails hung motionless and slack, the
<BR>very folds of their sagging surfaces moved no more
<BR>than carved granite.&nbsp; The impetuosity of my ad-
<BR>vent made the man at the helm start slightly.&nbsp; A
<BR>block aloft squeaked incomprehensibly, for what
<BR>on earth could have made it do so?&nbsp; It was a
<BR>whistling note like a bird's.&nbsp; For a long, long time
<BR>I faced an empty world, steeped in an infinity of
<BR>silence, through which the sunshine poured and
<BR>flowed for some mysterious purpose.&nbsp; Then I heard
<BR>Ransome's voice at my elbow.

<P>"I have put Mr. Burns back to bed, sir."

<P>"You have."

<P>"Well, sir, he got out, all of a sudden, but when
<BR>he let go the edge of his bunk he fell down.&nbsp; He
<BR>isn't light-headed, though, it seems to me."

<P>"No," I said dully, without looking at Ransome.
<BR>He waited for a moment, then cautiously, as if not
<BR>to give offence: "I don't think we need lose much
<BR>of that stuff, sir," he said, "I can sweep it up, every
<BR>bit of it almost, and then we could sift the glass out.
<BR>I will go about it at once.&nbsp; It will not make the
<BR>breakfast late, not ten minutes."

<P>"Oh, yes," I said bitterly.&nbsp; "Let the breakfast
<BR>wait, sweep up every bit of it, and then throw
<BR>the damned lot overboard!"

<P>The profound silence returned, and when I
<BR>looked over my shoulder, Ransome--the intelli-
<BR>gent, serene Ransome--had vanished from my
<BR>side.&nbsp; The intense loneliness of the sea acted like
<BR>poison on my brain.&nbsp; When I turned my eyes to the
<BR>ship, I had a morbid vision of her as a floating
<BR>grave.&nbsp; Who hasn't heard of ships found floating,
<BR>haphazard, with their crews all dead?&nbsp; I looked at
<BR>the seaman at the helm, I had an impulse to speak
<BR>to him, and, indeed, his face took on an expectant
<BR>cast as if he had guessed my intention.&nbsp; But in the
<BR>end I went below, thinking I would be alone with
<BR>the greatness of my trouble for a little while.&nbsp; But
<BR>through his open door Mr. Burns saw me come down,
<BR>and addressed me grumpily: "Well, sir?"

<P>I went in.&nbsp; "It isn't well at all," I said.

<P>Mr. Burns, reestablished in his bed-place, was
<BR>concealing his hirsute cheek in the palm of his
<BR>hand.

<P>"That confounded fellow has taken away the
<BR>scissors from me," were the next words he said.

<P>The tension I was suffering from was so great
<BR>that it was perhaps just as well that Mr. Burns had
<BR>started on his grievance.&nbsp; He seemed very sore
<BR>about it and grumbled, "Does he think I am mad,
<BR>or what?"

<P>"I don't think so, Mr. Burns," I said.&nbsp; I looked
<BR>upon him at that moment as a model of self-
<BR>possession.&nbsp; I even conceived on that account a
<BR>sort of admiration for that man, who had (apart
<BR>from the intense materiality of what was left of his
<BR>beard) come as near to being a disembodied spirit
<BR>as any man can do and live.&nbsp; I noticed the pre-
<BR>ternatural sharpness of the ridge of his nose, the
<BR>deep cavities of his temples, and I envied him.&nbsp; He
<BR>was so reduced that he would probably die very
<BR>soon.&nbsp; Enviable man!&nbsp; So near extinction--while
<BR>I had to bear within me a tumult of suffering
<BR>vitality, doubt, confusion, self-reproach, and an in-
<BR>definite reluctance to meet the horrid logic of the
<BR>situation.&nbsp; I could not help muttering: "I feel as
<BR>if I were going mad myself."

<P>Mr. Burns glared spectrally, but otherwise
<BR>wonderfully composed.

<P>"I always thought he would play us some deadly trick,"
<BR>he said, with a peculiar emphasis on the HE.

<P>It gave me a mental shock, but I had neither the
<BR>mind, nor the heart, nor the spirit to argue with
<BR>him.&nbsp; My form of sickness was indifference.&nbsp; The
<BR>creeping paralysis of a hopeless outlook.&nbsp; So I
<BR>only gazed at him.&nbsp; Mr. Burns broke into further
<BR>speech.

<P>"Eh!&nbsp; What!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; You won't believe it?&nbsp; Well,
<BR>how do you account for this?&nbsp; How do you think it
<BR>could have happened?"

<P>"Happened?" I repeated dully.&nbsp; "Why, yes,
<BR>how in the name of the infernal powers did this
<BR>thing happen?"

<P>Indeed, on thinking it out, it seemed incompre-
<BR>hensible that it should just be like this: the bottles
<BR>emptied, refilled, rewrapped, and replaced.&nbsp; A sort
<BR>of plot, a sinister attempt to deceive, a thing re-
<BR>sembling sly vengeance, but for what?&nbsp; Or else a
<BR>fiendish joke.&nbsp; But Mr. Burns was in possession of
<BR>a theory.&nbsp; It was simple, and he uttered it solemnly
<BR>in a hollow voice.

<P>"I suppose they have given him about fifteen
<BR>pounds in Haiphong for that little lot."

<P>"Mr. Burns!" I cried.

<P>He nodded grotesquely over his raised legs, like
<BR>two broomsticks in the pyjamas, with enormous
<BR>bare feet at the end.

<P>"Why not?&nbsp; The stuff is pretty expensive in this
<BR>part of the world, and they were very short of it in
<BR>Tonkin.&nbsp; And what did he care?&nbsp; You have not
<BR>known him.&nbsp; I have, and I have defied him.&nbsp; He
<BR>feared neither God, nor devil, nor man, nor wind,
<BR>nor sea, nor his own conscience.&nbsp; And I believe he
<BR>hated everybody and everything.&nbsp; But I think he
<BR>was afraid to die.&nbsp; I believe I am the only man
<BR>who ever stood up to him.&nbsp; I faced him in that
<BR>cabin where you live now, when he was sick, and I
<BR>cowed him then.&nbsp; He thought I was going to twist
<BR>his neck for him.&nbsp; If he had had his way we would
<BR>have been beating up against the Nord-East mon-
<BR>soon, as long as he lived and afterward, too, for ages
<BR>and ages.&nbsp; Acting the Flying Dutchman in the
<BR>China Sea!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Ha!"

<P>"But why should he replace the bottles like
<BR>this?" . . . I began.

<P>"Why shouldn't he?&nbsp; Why should he want to
<BR>throw the bottles away?&nbsp; They fit the drawer.
<BR>They belong to the medicine chest."

<P>"And they were wrapped up," I cried.

<P>"Well, the wrappers were there.&nbsp; Did it from
<BR>habit, I suppose, and as to refilling, there is always
<BR>a lot of stuff they send in paper parcels that burst
<BR>after a time.&nbsp; And then, who can tell?&nbsp; I suppose
<BR>you didn't taste it, sir?&nbsp; But, of course, you are
<BR>sure. . . ."

<P>"No," I said.&nbsp; "I didn't taste it.&nbsp; It is all over-
<BR>board now."

<P>Behind me, a soft, cultivated voice said: "I have
<BR>tasted it.&nbsp; It seemed a mixture of all sorts, sweet-
<BR>ish, saltish, very horrible."

<P>Ransome, stepping out of the pantry, had been
<BR>listening for some time, as it was very excusable
<BR>in him to do.

<P>"A dirty trick," said Mr. Burns.&nbsp; "I always
<BR>said he would."

<P>The magnitude of my indignation was un-
<BR>bounded.&nbsp; And the kind, sympathetic doctor, too.
<BR>The only sympathetic man I ever knew . . .
<BR>instead of writing that warning letter, the very re-
<BR>finement of sympathy, why didn't the man make a
<BR>proper inspection?&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, it was
<BR>hardly fair to blame the doctor.&nbsp; The fittings were
<BR>in order and the medicine chest is an officially ar-
<BR>ranged affair.&nbsp; There was nothing really to arouse
<BR>the slightest suspicion.&nbsp; The person I could never
<BR>forgive was myself.&nbsp; Nothing should ever be taken
<BR>for granted.&nbsp; The seed of everlasting remorse was
<BR>sown in my breast.

<P>"I feel it's all my fault," I exclaimed, "mine and
<BR>nobody else's.&nbsp; That's how I feel.&nbsp; I shall never
<BR>forgive myself."

<P>"That's very foolish, sir," said Mr. Burns fiercely.

<P>And after this effort he fell back exhausted on
<BR>his bed.&nbsp; He closed his eyes, he panted; this affair,
<BR>this abominable surprise had shaken him up, too.
<BR>As I turned away I perceived Ransome looking at
<BR>me blankly.&nbsp; He appreciated what it meant, but
<BR>managed to produce his pleasant, wistful smile.
<BR>Then he stepped back into his pantry, and I rushed
<BR>up on deck again to see whether there was any
<BR>wind, any breath under the sky, any stir of the air,
<BR>any sign of hope.&nbsp; The deadly stillness met me
<BR>again.&nbsp; Nothing was changed except that there
<BR>was a different man at the wheel.&nbsp; He looked ill.
<BR>His whole figure drooped, and he seemed rather to
<BR>cling to the spokes than hold them with a controll-
<BR>ing grip.&nbsp; I said to him:

<P>"You are not fit to be here."

<P>"I can manage, sir," he said feebly.

<P>As a matter of fact, there was nothing for him to do.
<BR>The ship had no steerage way.&nbsp; She lay with her
<BR>head to the westward, the everlasting Koh-ring
<BR>visible over the stern, with a few small islets, black
<BR>spots in the great blaze, swimming before my
<BR>troubled eyes.&nbsp; And but for those bits of land there
<BR>was no speck on the sky, no speck on the water, no
<BR>shape of vapour, no wisp of smoke, no sail, no boat,
<BR>no stir of humanity, no sign of life, nothing!

<P>The first question was, what to do?&nbsp; What could
<BR>one do?&nbsp; The first thing to do obviously was to tell
<BR>the men.&nbsp; I did it that very day.&nbsp; I wasn't going
<BR>to let the knowledge simply get about.&nbsp; I would
<BR>face them.&nbsp; They were assembled on the quarter-
<BR>deck for the purpose.&nbsp; Just before I stepped out to
<BR>speak to them I discovered that life could hold
<BR>terrible moments.&nbsp; No confessed criminal had ever
<BR>been so oppressed by his sense of guilt.&nbsp; This is
<BR>why, perhaps, my face was set hard and my voice
<BR>curt and unemotional while I made my declaration
<BR>that I could do nothing more for the sick in the way
<BR>of drugs.&nbsp; As to such care as could be given them
<BR>they knew they had had it.

<P>I would have held them justified in tearing me
<BR>limb from limb.&nbsp; The silence which followed upon
<BR>my words was almost harder to bear than the
<BR>angriest uproar.&nbsp; I was crushed by the infinite
<BR>depth of its reproach.&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, I
<BR>was mistaken.&nbsp; In a voice which I had great diffi-
<BR>culty in keeping firm, I went on: "I suppose, men,
<BR>you have understood what I said, and you know
<BR>what it means."

<P>A voice or two were heard: "Yes, sir. . . .&nbsp; We
<BR>understand."

<P>They had kept silent simply because they
<BR>thought that they were not called to say anything;
<BR>and when I told them that I intended to run into
<BR>Singapore and that the best chance for the ship
<BR>and the men was in the efforts all of us, sick and
<BR>well, must make to get her along out of this, I re-
<BR>ceived the encouragement of a low assenting mur-
<BR>mur and of a louder voice exclaiming: "Surely
<BR>there is a way out of this blamed hole."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>***
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here is an extract from the notes I wrote at the time.

<P>"We have lost Koh-ring at last.&nbsp; For many days
<BR>now I don't think I have been two hours below al-
<BR>together.&nbsp; I remain on deck, of course, night and
<BR>day, and the nights and the days wheel over us in
<BR>succession, whether long or short, who can say?
<BR>All sense of time is lost in the monotony of ex-
<BR>pectation, of hope, and of desire--which is only
<BR>one: Get the ship to the southward!&nbsp; Get the ship
<BR>to the southward!&nbsp; The effect is curiously me-
<BR>chanical; the sun climbs and descends, the night
<BR>swings over our heads as if somebody below the
<BR>horizon were turning a crank.&nbsp; It is the prettiest,
<BR>the most aimless! . . . and all through that
<BR>miserable performance I go on, tramping, tramp-
<BR>ing the deck.&nbsp; How many miles have I walked on
<BR>the poop of that ship!&nbsp; A stubborn pilgrimage of
<BR>sheer restlessness, diversified by short excursions
<BR>below to look upon Mr. Burns.&nbsp; I don't know
<BR>whether it is an illusion, but he seems to become
<BR>more substantial from day to day.&nbsp; He doesn't say
<BR>much, for, indeed, the situation doesn't lend itself
<BR>to idle remarks.&nbsp; I notice this even with the men as
<BR>I watch them moving or sitting about the decks.
<BR>They don't talk to each other.&nbsp; It strikes me that
<BR>if there exists an invisible ear catching the whispers
<BR>of the earth, it will find this ship the most silent
<BR>spot on it. . . .

<P>"No, Mr. Burns has not much to say to me.&nbsp; He
<BR>sits in his bunk with his beard gone, his moustaches
<BR>flaming, and with an air of silent determination on
<BR>his chalky physiognomy.&nbsp; Ransome tells me he
<BR>devours all the food that is given him to the last
<BR>scrap, but that, apparently, he sleeps very little.
<BR>Even at night, when I go below to fill my pipe, I
<BR>notice that, though dozing flat on his back, he
<BR>still looks very determined.&nbsp; From the side glance
<BR>he gives me when awake it seems as though he were
<BR>annoyed at being interrupted in some arduous
<BR>mental operation; and as I emerge on deck the
<BR>ordered arrangement of the stars meets my eye, un-
<BR>clouded, infinitely wearisome.&nbsp; There they are:
<BR>stars, sun, sea, light, darkness, space, great waters;
<BR>the formidable Work of the Seven Days, into which
<BR>mankind seems to have blundered unbidden.&nbsp; Or
<BR>else decoyed.&nbsp; Even as I have been decoyed into
<BR>this awful, this death-haunted command. . . ."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>***
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The only spot of light in the ship at night was
<BR>that of the compass-lamps, lighting up the faces of
<BR>the succeeding helmsmen; for the rest we were lost
<BR>in the darkness, I walking the poop and the men
<BR>lying about the decks.&nbsp; They were all so reduced
<BR>by sickness that no watches could be kept.&nbsp; Those
<BR>who were able to walk remained all the time on
<BR>duty, lying about in the shadows of the main deck,
<BR>till my voice raised for an order would bring them
<BR>to their enfeebled feet, a tottering little group, mov-
<BR>ing patently about the ship, with hardly a mur-
<BR>mur, a whisper amongst them all.&nbsp; And every
<BR>time I had to raise my voice it was with a pang of
<BR>remorse and pity.

<P>Then about four o'clock in the morning a light
<BR>would gleam forward in the galley.&nbsp; The unfailing
<BR>Ransome with the uneasy heart, immune, serene,
<BR>and active, was getting ready for the early coffee for
<BR>the men.&nbsp; Presently he would bring me a cup up
<BR>on the poop, and it was then that I allowed myself
<BR>to drop into my deck chair for a couple of hours of
<BR>real sleep.&nbsp; No doubt I must have been snatching
<BR>short dozes when leaning against the rail for a mo-
<BR>ment in sheer exhaustion; but, honestly, I was not
<BR>aware of them, except in the painful form of con-
<BR>vulsive starts that seemed to come on me even
<BR>while I walked.&nbsp; From about five, however, until
<BR>after seven I would sleep openly under the fading
<BR>stars.

<P>I would say to the helmsman: "Call me at
<BR>need," and drop into that chair and close my eyes,
<BR>feeling that there was no more sleep for me on
<BR>earth.&nbsp; And then I would know nothing till, some
<BR>time between seven and eight, I would feel a touch
<BR>on my shoulder and look up at Ransome's face,
<BR>with its faint, wistful smile and friendly, gray
<BR>eyes, as though he were tenderly amused at my
<BR>slumbers.&nbsp; Occasionally the second mate would
<BR>come up and relieve me at early coffee time.&nbsp; But
<BR>it didn't really matter.&nbsp; Generally it was a dead
<BR>calm, or else faint airs so changing and fugitive
<BR>that it really wasn't worth while to touch a brace
<BR>for them.&nbsp; If the air steadied at all the seaman at
<BR>the helm could be trusted for a warning shout:
<BR>"Ship's all aback, sir!" which like a trumpet-
<BR>call would make me spring a foot above the deck.
<BR>Those were the words which it seemed to me would
<BR>have made me spring up from eternal sleep.&nbsp; But
<BR>this was not often.&nbsp; I have never met since such
<BR>breathless sunrises.&nbsp; And if the second mate hap-
<BR>pened to be there (he had generally one day in
<BR>three free of fever) I would find him sitting on the
<BR>skylight half senseless, as it were, and with an
<BR>idiotic gaze fastened on some object near by--a
<BR>rope, a cleat, a belaying pin, a ringbolt.

<P>That young man was rather troublesome.&nbsp; He
<BR>remained cubbish in his sufferings.&nbsp; He seemed to
<BR>have become completely imbecile; and when the re-
<BR>turn of fever drove him to his cabin below, the next
<BR>thing would be that we would miss him from there.
<BR>The first time it happened Ransome and I were
<BR>very much alarmed.&nbsp; We started a quiet search
<BR>and ultimately Ransome discovered him curled up
<BR>in the sail-locker, which opened into the lobby by a
<BR>sliding door.&nbsp; When remonstrated with, he mut-
<BR>tered sulkily, "It's cool in there."&nbsp; That wasn't
<BR>true.&nbsp; It was only dark there.

<P>The fundamental defects of his face were not im-
<BR>proved by its uniform livid hue.&nbsp; The disease dis-
<BR>closed its low type in a startling way.&nbsp; It was not
<BR>so with many of the men.&nbsp; The wastage of ill-
<BR>health seemed to idealise the general character of
<BR>the features, bringing out the unsuspected nobility
<BR>of some, the strength of others, and in one case re-
<BR>vealing an essentially comic aspect.&nbsp; He was a
<BR>short, gingery, active man with a nose and chin of
<BR>the Punch type, and whom his shipmates called
<BR>"Frenchy."&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp; He may have
<BR>been a Frenchman, but I have never heard him
<BR>utter a single word in French.

<P>To see him coming aft to the wheel comforted
<BR>one.&nbsp; The blue dungaree trousers turned up the
<BR>calf, one leg a little higher than the other, the clean
<BR>check shirt, the white canvas cap, evidently made
<BR>by himself, made up a whole of peculiar smartness,
<BR>and the persistent jauntiness of his gait, even, poor
<BR>fellow, when he couldn't help tottering, told of his
<BR>invincible spirit.&nbsp; There was also a man called
<BR>Gambril.&nbsp; He was the only grizzled person in the
<BR>ship.&nbsp; His face was of an austere type.&nbsp; But if I re-
<BR>member all their faces, wasting tragically before my
<BR>eyes, most of their names have vanished from my
<BR>memory.

<P>The words that passed between us were few and
<BR>puerile in regard of the situation.&nbsp; I had to force
<BR>myself to look them in the face.&nbsp; I expected to
<BR>meet reproachful glances.&nbsp; There were none.&nbsp; The
<BR>expression of suffering in their eyes was indeed
<BR>hard enough to bear.&nbsp; But that they couldn't help.
<BR>For the rest, I ask myself whether it was the temper
<BR>of their souls or the sympathy of their imagination
<BR>that made them so wonderful, so worthy of my un-
<BR>dying regard.

<P>For myself, neither my soul was highly tempered,
<BR>nor my imagination properly under control.&nbsp; There
<BR>were moments when I felt, not only that I would go
<BR>mad, but that I had gone mad already; so that I
<BR>dared not open my lips for fear of betraying myself
<BR>by some insane shriek.&nbsp; Luckily I had only orders
<BR>to give, and an order has a steadying influence upon
<BR>him who has to give it.&nbsp; Moreover, the seaman,
<BR>the officer of the watch, in me was sufficiently sane.
<BR>I was like a mad carpenter making a box.
<BR>Were he ever so convinced that he was King of
<BR>Jerusalem, the box he would make would be a sane
<BR>box.&nbsp; What I feared was a shrill note escaping me
<BR>involuntarily and upsetting my balance.&nbsp; Luckily,
<BR>again, there was no necessity to raise one's voice.
<BR>The brooding stillness of the world seemed sensitive
<BR>to the slightest sound, like a whispering gallery.
<BR>The conversational tone would almost carry a
<BR>word from one end of the ship to the other.&nbsp; The
<BR>terrible thing was that the only voice that I ever
<BR>heard was my own.&nbsp; At night especially it reverber-
<BR>ated very lonely amongst the planes of the un-
<BR>stirring sails.

<P>Mr. Burns, still keeping to his bed with that air
<BR>of secret determination, was moved to grumble at
<BR>many things.&nbsp; Our interviews were short five-
<BR>minute affairs, but fairly frequent.&nbsp; I was everlast-
<BR>ingly diving down below to get a light, though I did
<BR>not consume much tobacco at that time.&nbsp; The pipe
<BR>was always going out; for in truth my mind was not
<BR>composed enough to enable me to get a decent
<BR>smoke.&nbsp; Likewise, for most of the time during the
<BR>twenty-four hours I could have struck matches on
<BR>deck and held them aloft till the flame burnt my
<BR>fingers.&nbsp; But I always used to run below.&nbsp; It was
<BR>a change.&nbsp; It was the only break in the incessant
<BR>strain; and, of course, Mr. Burns through the open
<BR>door could see me come in and go out every time.

<P>With his knees gathered up under his chin and
<BR>staring with his greenish eyes over them, he was a
<BR>weird figure, and with my knowledge of the crazy
<BR>notion in his head, not a very attractive one for me.
<BR>Still, I had to speak to him now and then, and one
<BR>day he complained that the ship was very silent.
<BR>For hours and hours, he said, he was lying there, not
<BR>hearing a sound, till he did not know what to do
<BR>with himself.

<P>"When Ransome happens to be forward in his
<BR>galley everything's so still that one might think
<BR>everybody in the ship was dead," he grumbled.
<BR>"The only voice I do hear sometimes is yours, sir,
<BR>and that isn't enough to cheer me up.&nbsp; What's the
<BR>matter with the men?&nbsp; Isn't there one left that can
<BR>sing out at the ropes?"

<P>"Not one, Mr. Burns," I said.&nbsp; "There is no
<BR>breath to spare on board this ship for that.&nbsp; Are
<BR>you aware that there are times when I can't muster
<BR>more than three hands to do anything?"

<P>He asked swiftly but fearfully:

<P>"Nobody dead yet, sir?"

<P>"No."

<P>"It wouldn't do," Mr. Burns declared forcibly.
<BR>"Mustn't let him.&nbsp; If he gets hold of one he will
<BR>get them all."

<P>I cried out angrily at this.&nbsp; I believe I even
<BR>swore at the disturbing effect of these words.
<BR>They attacked all the self-possession that was left
<BR>to me.&nbsp; In my endless vigil in the face of the enemy
<BR>I had been haunted by gruesome images enough.&nbsp; I
<BR>had had visions of a ship drifting in calms and
<BR>swinging in light airs, with all her crew dying slowly
<BR>about her decks.&nbsp; Such things had been known to
<BR>happen.

<P>Mr. Burns met my outburst by a mysterious
<BR>silence.

<P>"Look here," I said.&nbsp; "You don't believe your-
<BR>self what you say.&nbsp; You can't.&nbsp; It's impossible.
<BR>It isn't the sort of thing I have a right to expect
<BR>from you.&nbsp; My position's bad enough without
<BR>being worried with your silly fancies."

<P>He remained unmoved.&nbsp; On account of the way
<BR>in which the light fell on his head I could not be
<BR>sure whether he had smiled faintly or not.&nbsp; I
<BR>changed my tone.

<P>"Listen," I said.&nbsp; "It's getting so desperate
<BR>that I had thought for a moment, since we can't
<BR>make our way south, whether I wouldn't try to
<BR>steer west and make an attempt to reach the mail-
<BR>boat track.&nbsp; We could always get some quinine
<BR>from her, at least.&nbsp; What do you think?"

<P>He cried out: "No, no, no.&nbsp; Don't do that, sir.
<BR>You mustn't for a moment give up facing that old
<BR>ruffian.&nbsp; If you do he will get the upper hand of
<BR>us."

<P>I left him.&nbsp; He was impossible.&nbsp; It was like a
<BR>case of possession.&nbsp; His protest, however, was
<BR>essentially quite sound.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, my
<BR>notion of heading out west on the chance of sight-
<BR>ing a problematical steamer could not bear calm
<BR>examination.&nbsp; On the side where we were we had
<BR>enough wind, at least from time to time, to struggle
<BR>on toward the south.&nbsp; Enough, at least, to keep
<BR>hope alive.&nbsp; But suppose that I had used those
<BR>capricious gusts of wind to sail away to the west-
<BR>ward, into some region where there was not a
<BR>breath of air for days on end, what then?&nbsp; Perhaps
<BR>my appalling vision of a ship floating with a dead
<BR>crew would become a reality for the discovery
<BR>weeks afterward by some horror-stricken mariners.

<P>That afternoon Ransome brought me up a cup
<BR>of tea, and while waiting there, tray in hand, he re-
<BR>marked in the exactly right tone of sympathy:

<P>"You are holding out well, sir."

<P>"Yes," I said.&nbsp; "You and I seem to have been
<BR>forgotten."

<P>"Forgotten, sir?"

<P>"Yes, by the fever-devil who has got on board
<BR>this ship," I said.

<P>Ransome gave me one of his attractive, intelli-
<BR>gent, quick glances and went away with the tray.
<BR>It occurred to me that I had been talking some-
<BR>what in Mr. Burns' manner.&nbsp; It annoyed me.&nbsp; Yet
<BR>often in darker moments I forgot myself into an
<BR>attitude toward our troubles more fit for a contest
<BR>against a living enemy.

<P>Yes.&nbsp; The fever-devil had not laid his hand yet
<BR>either on Ransome or on me.&nbsp; But he might at any
<BR>time.&nbsp; It was one of those thoughts one had to
<BR>fight down, keep at arm's length at any cost.&nbsp; It
<BR>was unbearable to contemplate the possibility of
<BR>Ransome, the housekeeper of the ship, being laid
<BR>low.&nbsp; And what would happen to my command if
<BR>I got knocked over, with Mr. Burns too weak to
<BR>stand without holding on to his bed-place and the
<BR>second mate reduced to a state of permanent im-
<BR>becility?&nbsp; It was impossible to imagine, or rather,
<BR>it was only too easy to imagine.

<P>I was alone on the poop.&nbsp; The ship having no
<BR>steerage way, I had sent the helmsman away to sit
<BR>down or lie down somewhere in the shade.&nbsp; The
<BR>men's strength was so reduced that all unnecessary
<BR>calls on it had to be avoided.&nbsp; It was the austere
<BR>Gambril with the grizzly beard.&nbsp; He went away
<BR>readily enough, but he was so weakened by re-
<BR>peated bouts of fever, poor fellow, that in order to
<BR>get down the poop ladder he had to turn sideways
<BR>and hang on with both hands to the brass rail.&nbsp; It
<BR>was just simply heart-breaking to watch.&nbsp; Yet he
<BR>was neither very much worse nor much better than
<BR>most of the half-dozen miserable victims I could
<BR>muster up on deck.

<P>It was a terribly lifeless afternoon.&nbsp; For several
<BR>days in succession low clouds had appeared in the
<BR>distance, white masses with dark convolutions rest-
<BR>ing on the water, motionless, almost solid, and yet
<BR>all the time changing their aspects subtly.&nbsp; To-
<BR>ward evening they vanished as a rule.&nbsp; But this
<BR>day they awaited the setting sun, which glowed and
<BR>smouldered sulkily amongst them before it sank
<BR>down.&nbsp; The punctual and wearisome stars re-
<BR>appeared over our mastheads, but the air remained
<BR>stagnant and oppressive.

<P>The unfailing Ransome lighted the binnacle-
<BR>lamps and glided, all shadowy, up to me.

<P>"Will you go down and try to eat something,
<BR>sir?" he suggested.

<P>His low voice startled me.&nbsp; I had been standing
<BR>looking out over the rail, saying nothing, feeling
<BR>nothing, not even the weariness of my limbs, over-
<BR>come by the evil spell.

<P>"Ransome," I asked abruptly, "how long have I
<BR>been on deck?&nbsp; I am losing the notion of time."

<P>"Twelve days, sir," he said, "and it's just a
<BR>fortnight since we left the anchorage."

<P>His equable voice sounded mournful somehow.
<BR>He waited a bit, then added: "It's the first time
<BR>that it looks as if we were to have some rain."

<P>I noticed then the broad shadow on the horizon,
<BR>extinguishing the low stars completely, while those
<BR>overhead, when I looked up, seemed to shine down
<BR>on us through a veil of smoke.

<P>How it got there, how it had crept up so high, I
<BR>couldn't say.&nbsp; It had an ominous appearance.&nbsp; The
<BR>air did not stir.&nbsp; At a renewed invitation from
<BR>Ransome I did go down into the cabin to--in his
<BR>own words--"try and eat something."&nbsp; I don't
<BR>know that the trial was very successful.&nbsp; I sup-
<BR>pose at that period I did exist on food in the usual
<BR>way; but the memory is now that in those days life
<BR>was sustained on invincible anguish, as a sort of
<BR>infernal stimulant exciting and consuming at the
<BR>same time.

<P>It's the only period of my life in which I at-
<BR>tempted to keep a diary.&nbsp; No, not the only one.
<BR>Years later, in conditions of moral isolation, I did
<BR>put down on paper the thoughts and events of a
<BR>score of days.&nbsp; But this was the first time.&nbsp; I don't
<BR>remember how it came about or how the pocket-
<BR>book and the pencil came into my hands.&nbsp; It's in-
<BR>conceivable that I should have looked for them on
<BR>purpose.&nbsp; I suppose they saved me from the crazy
<BR>trick of talking to myself.

<P>Strangely enough, in both cases I took to that
<BR>sort of thing in circumstances in which I did not ex-
<BR>pect, in colloquial phrase, "to come out of it."
<BR>Neither could I expect the record to outlast me.
<BR>This shows that it was purely a personal need for
<BR>intimate relief and not a call of egotism.

<P>Here I must give another sample of it, a few de-
<BR>tached lines, now looking very ghostly to my own
<BR>eyes, out of the part scribbled that very evening:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>***
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is something going on in the sky like
<BR>a decomposition; like a corruption of the air,
<BR>which remains as still as ever.&nbsp; After all, mere
<BR>clouds, which may or may not hold wind or rain.
<BR>Strange that it should trouble me so.&nbsp; I feel as if all
<BR>my sins had found me out.&nbsp; But I suppose the
<BR>trouble is that the ship is still lying motionless, not
<BR>under command; and that I have nothing to do to
<BR>keep my imagination from running wild amongst
<BR>the disastrous images of the worst that may befall
<BR>us.&nbsp; What's going to happen?&nbsp; Probably nothing.
<BR>Or anything.&nbsp; It may be a furious squall coming,
<BR>butt end foremost.&nbsp; And on deck there are five
<BR>men with the vitality and the strength, of say, two.
<BR>We may have all our sails blown away.&nbsp; Every
<BR>stitch of canvas has been on her since we broke
<BR>ground at the mouth of the Mei-nam, fifteen days
<BR>ago . . . or fifteen centuries.&nbsp; It seems to me
<BR>that all my life before that momentous day is in-
<BR>finitely remote, a fading memory of light-hearted
<BR>youth, something on the other side of a shadow.
<BR>Yes, sails may very well be blown away.&nbsp; And that
<BR>would be like a death sentence on the men.&nbsp; We
<BR>haven't strength enough on board to bend another
<BR>suit; incredible thought, but it is true.&nbsp; Or we may
<BR>even get dismasted.&nbsp; Ships have been dismasted in
<BR>squalls simply because they weren't handled quick
<BR>enough, and we have no power to whirl the yards
<BR>around.&nbsp; It's like being bound hand and foot pre-
<BR>paratory to having one's throat cut.&nbsp; And what
<BR>appals me most of all is that I shrink from going on
<BR>deck to face it.&nbsp; It's due to the ship, it's due to the
<BR>men who are there on deck--some of them, ready
<BR>to put out the last remnant of their strength at a
<BR>word from me.&nbsp; And I am shrinking from it.&nbsp; From
<BR>the mere vision.&nbsp; My first command.&nbsp; Now I
<BR>understand that strange sense of insecurity in my
<BR>past.&nbsp; I always suspected that I might be no good.
<BR>And here is proof positive.&nbsp; I am shirking it.&nbsp; I
<BR>am no good."
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>***
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At that moment, or, perhaps, the moment after,
<BR>I became aware of Ransome standing in the cabin.
<BR>Something in his expression startled me.&nbsp; It had a
<BR>meaning which I could not make out.&nbsp; I exclaimed:
<BR>"Somebody's dead."

<P>It was his turn then to look startled.

<P>"Dead?&nbsp; Not that I know of, sir.&nbsp; I have been in
<BR>the forecastle only ten minutes ago and there was
<BR>no dead man there then."

<P>"You did give me a scare," I said.

<P>His voice was extremely pleasant to listen to.
<BR>He explained that he had come down below to close
<BR>Mr. Burns' port in case it should come on to rain.
<BR>"He did not know that I was in the cabin," he added.

<P>"How does it look outside?" I asked him.

<P>"Very black, indeed, sir.&nbsp; There is something in
<BR>it for certain."

<P>"In what quarter?"

<P>"All round, sir."

<P>I repeated idly: "All round.&nbsp; For certain," with
<BR>my elbows on the table.

<P>Ransome lingered in the cabin as if he had some-
<BR>thing to do there, but hesitated about doing it.&nbsp; I
<BR>said suddenly:

<P>"You think I ought to be on deck?"

<P>He answered at once but without any particular
<BR>emphasis or accent: "I do, sir."

<P>I got to my feet briskly, and he made way for me
<BR>to go out.&nbsp; As I passed through the lobby I heard
<BR>Mr. Burns' voice saying:

<P>"Shut the door of my room, will you, steward?"
<BR>And Ransome's rather surprised: "Certainly, sir."

<P>I thought that all my feelings had been dulled
<BR>into complete indifference.&nbsp; But I found it as try-
<BR>ing as ever to be on deck.&nbsp; The impenetrable black-
<BR>ness beset the ship so close that it seemed that by
<BR>thrusting one's hand over the side one could touch
<BR>some unearthly substance.&nbsp; There was in it an
<BR>effect of inconceivable terror and of inexpressible
<BR>mystery.&nbsp; The few stars overhead shed a dim light
<BR>upon the ship alone, with no gleams of any kind
<BR>upon the water, in detached shafts piercing an at-
<BR>mosphere which had turned to soot.&nbsp; It was some-
<BR>thing I had never seen before, giving no hint of the
<BR>direction from which any change would come, the
<BR>closing in of a menace from all sides.

<P>There was still no man at the helm.&nbsp; The im-
<BR>mobility of all things was perfect.&nbsp; If the air had
<BR>turned black, the sea, for all I knew, might have
<BR>turned solid.&nbsp; It was no good looking in any di-
<BR>rection, watching for any sign, speculating upon
<BR>the nearness of the moment.&nbsp; When the time came
<BR>the blackness would overwhelm silently the bit of
<BR>starlight falling upon the ship, and the end of all
<BR>things would come without a sigh, stir, or murmur
<BR>of any kind, and all our hearts would cease to beat
<BR>like run-down clocks.

<P>It was impossible to shake off that sense of
<BR>finality.&nbsp; The quietness that came over me was
<BR>like a foretaste of annihilation.&nbsp; It gave me a sort
<BR>of comfort, as though my soul had become suddenly
<BR>reconciled to an eternity of blind stillness.

<P>The seaman's instinct alone survived whole in
<BR>my moral dissolution.&nbsp; I descended the ladder to
<BR>the quarter-deck.&nbsp; The starlight seemed to die out
<BR>before reaching that spot, but when I asked
<BR>quietly: "Are you there, men?" my eyes made out
<BR>shadow forms starting up around me, very few,
<BR>very indistinct; and a voice spoke: "All here, sir."
<BR>Another amended anxiously:

<P>"All that are any good for anything, sir."

<P>Both voices were very quiet and unringing; with-
<BR>out any special character of readiness or discour-
<BR>agement.&nbsp; Very matter-of-fact voices.

<P>"We must try to haul this mainsail close up," I said.

<P>The shadows swayed away from me without a
<BR>word.&nbsp; Those men were the ghosts of themselves,
<BR>and their weight on a rope could be no more than
<BR>the weight of a bunch of ghosts.&nbsp; Indeed, if ever a
<BR>sail was hauled up by sheer spiritual strength it
<BR>must have been that sail, for, properly speaking,
<BR>there was not muscle enough for the task in the
<BR>whole ship let alone the miserable lot of us on deck.
<BR>Of course, I took the lead in the work myself.
<BR>They wandered feebly after me from rope to rope,
<BR>stumbling and panting.&nbsp; They toiled like Titans.
<BR>We were half-an-hour at it at least, and all the time
<BR>the black universe made no sound.&nbsp; When the last
<BR>leech-line was made fast, my eyes, accustomed to
<BR>the darkness, made out the shapes of exhausted
<BR>men drooping over the rails, collapsed on hatches.
<BR>One hung over the after-capstan, sobbing for
<BR>breath, and I stood amongst them like a tower of
<BR>strength, impervious to disease and feeling only the
<BR>sickness of my soul.&nbsp; I waited for some time fight-
<BR>ing against the weight of my sins, against my sense
<BR>of unworthiness, and then I said:

<P>"Now, men, we'll go aft and square the mainyard.
<BR>That's about all we can do for the ship; and for the
<BR>rest she must take her chance."
