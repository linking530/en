<P>WITH her anchor at the bow and clothed in canvas
<BR>to her very trucks, my command seemed to stand
<BR>as motionless as a model ship set on the gleams and
<BR>shadows of polished marble.&nbsp; It was impossible
<BR>to distinguish land from water in the enigmatical
<BR>tranquillity of the immense forces of the world.
<BR>A sudden impatience possessed me.

<P>"Won't she answer the helm at all?" I said
<BR>irritably to the man whose strong brown hands
<BR>grasping the spokes of the wheel stood out lighted
<BR>on the darkness; like a symbol of mankind's claim
<BR>to the direction of its own fate.

<P>He answered me.

<P>"Yes, sir.&nbsp; She's coming-to slowly."

<P>"Let her head come up to south."

<P>"Aye, aye, sir."

<P>I paced the poop.&nbsp; There was not a sound but
<BR>that of my footsteps, till the man spoke again.

<P>"She is at south now, sir."

<P>I felt a slight tightness of the chest before I gave
<BR>out the first course of my first command to the
<BR>silent night, heavy with dew and sparkling with
<BR>stars.&nbsp; There was a finality in the act commit-
<BR>ting me to the endless vigilance of my lonely task.

<P>"Steady her head at that," I said at last.&nbsp; "The
<BR>course is south."

<P>"South, sir," echoed the man.

<P>I sent below the second mate and his watch and
<BR>remained in charge, walking the deck through the
<BR>chill, somnolent hours that precede the dawn.

<P>Slight puffs came and went, and whenever they
<BR>were strong enough to wake up the black water the
<BR>murmur alongside ran through my very heart in a
<BR>delicate crescendo of delight and died away swiftly.
<BR>I was bitterly tired.&nbsp; The very stars seemed weary
<BR>of waiting for daybreak.&nbsp; It came at last with a
<BR>mother-of-pearl sheen at the zenith, such as I had
<BR>never seen before in the tropics, unglowing, almost
<BR>gray, with a strange reminder of high latitudes.

<P>The voice of the look-out man hailed from for-
<BR>ward:

<P>"Land on the port bow, sir."

<P>"All right."

<P>Leaning on the rail I never even raised my eyes.

<P>The motion of the ship was imperceptible.&nbsp; Pres-
<BR>ently Ransome brought me the cup of morning
<BR>coffee.&nbsp; After I had drunk it I looked ahead, and in
<BR>the still streak of very bright pale orange light I
<BR>saw the land profiled flatly as if cut out of black
<BR>paper and seeming to float on the water as light as
<BR>cork.&nbsp; But the rising sun turned it into mere dark
<BR>vapour, a doubtful, massive shadow trembling in
<BR>the hot glare.

<P>The watch finished washing decks.&nbsp; I went be-
<BR>low and stopped at Mr. Burns' door (he could not
<BR>bear to have it shut), but hesitated to speak to him
<BR>till he moved his eyes.&nbsp; I gave him the news.

<P>"Sighted Cape Liant at daylight.&nbsp; About fifteen
<BR>miles."

<P>He moved his lips then, but I heard no sound
<BR>till I put my ear down, and caught the peevish
<BR>comment: "This is crawling. . . .&nbsp; No luck."

<P>"Better luck than standing still, anyhow," I
<BR>pointed out resignedly, and left him to whatever
<BR>thoughts or fancies haunted his awful immobility.

<P>Later that morning, when relieved by my second
<BR>officer, I threw myself on my couch and for some
<BR>three hours or so I really found oblivion.&nbsp; It was so
<BR>perfect that on waking up I wondered where I was.
<BR>Then came the immense relief of the thought: on
<BR>board my ship!&nbsp; At sea!&nbsp; At sea!

<P>Through the port-holes I beheld an unruffled,
<BR>sun-smitten horizon.&nbsp; The horizon of a windless
<BR>day.&nbsp; But its spaciousness alone was enough to
<BR>give me a sense of a fortunate escape, a momentary
<BR>exultation of freedom.

<P>I stepped out into the saloon with my heart
<BR>lighter than it had been for days.&nbsp; Ransome was at
<BR>the sideboard preparing to lay the table for the first
<BR>sea dinner of the passage.&nbsp; He turned his head, and
<BR>something in his eyes checked my modest elation.

<P>Instinctively I asked: "What is it now?" not ex-
<BR>pecting in the least the answer I got.&nbsp; It was given
<BR>with that sort of contained serenity which was
<BR>characteristic of the man.

<P>"I am afraid we haven't left all sickness behind
<BR>us, sir."

<P>"We haven't!&nbsp; What's the matter?"

<P>He told me then that two of our men had been
<BR>taken bad with fever in the night.&nbsp; One of them
<BR>was burning and the other was shivering, but he
<BR>thought that it was pretty much the same thing.
<BR>I thought so, too.&nbsp; I felt shocked by the news.
<BR>"One burning, the other shivering, you say?&nbsp; No.
<BR>We haven't left the sickness behind.&nbsp; Do they look
<BR>very ill?"

<P>"Middling bad, sir."&nbsp; Ransome's eyes gazed
<BR>steadily into mine.&nbsp; We exchanged smiles.&nbsp; Ran-
<BR>some's a little wistful, as usual, mine no doubt grim
<BR>enough, to correspond with my secret exasperation.

<P>I asked:

<P>"Was there any wind at all this morning?"

<P>"Can hardly say that, sir.&nbsp; We've moved all the
<BR>time though.&nbsp; The land ahead seems a little nearer."

<P>That was it.&nbsp; A little nearer.&nbsp; Whereas if we
<BR>had only had a little more wind, only a very little
<BR>more, we might, we should, have been abreast of
<BR>Liant by this time and increasing our distance from
<BR>that contaminated shore.&nbsp; And it was not only the
<BR>distance.&nbsp; It seemed to me that a stronger breeze
<BR>would have blown away the contamination which
<BR>clung to the ship.&nbsp; It obviously did cling to the
<BR>ship.&nbsp; Two men.&nbsp; One burning, one shivering.&nbsp; I
<BR>felt a distinct reluctance to go and look at them.
<BR>What was the good?&nbsp; Poison is poison.&nbsp; Tropical
<BR>fever is tropical fever.&nbsp; But that it should have
<BR>stretched its claw after us over the sea seemed to
<BR>me an extraordinary and unfair license.&nbsp; I could
<BR>hardly believe that it could be anything worse than
<BR>the last desperate pluck of the evil from which we
<BR>were escaping into the clean breath of the sea.&nbsp; If
<BR>only that breath had been a little stronger.&nbsp; How-
<BR>ever, there was the quinine against the fever.&nbsp; I
<BR>went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest
<BR>was kept to prepare two doses.&nbsp; I opened it full of
<BR>faith as a man opens a miraculous shrine.&nbsp; The
<BR>upper part was inhabited by a collection of bottles,
<BR>all square-shouldered and as like each other as
<BR>peas.&nbsp; Under that orderly array there were two
<BR>drawers, stuffed as full of things as one could im-
<BR>agine--paper packages, bandages, cardboard boxes
<BR>officially labelled.&nbsp; The lower of the two, in one
<BR>of its compartments, contained our provision of
<BR>quinine.

<P>There were five bottles, all round and all of a
<BR>size.&nbsp; One was about a third full.&nbsp; The other four
<BR>remained still wrapped up in paper and sealed.
<BR>But I did not expect to see an envelope lying on top
<BR>of them.&nbsp; A square envelope, belonging, in fact, to
<BR>the ship's stationery.

<P>It lay so that I could see it was not closed down,
<BR>and on picking it up and turning it over I perceived
<BR>that it was addressed to myself.&nbsp; It contained a
<BR>half-sheet of notepaper, which I unfolded with a
<BR>queer sense of dealing with the uncanny, but with-
<BR>out any excitement as people meet and do ex-
<BR>traordinary things in a dream.

<P>"My dear Captain," it began, but I ran to the
<BR>signature.&nbsp; The writer was the doctor.&nbsp; The date
<BR>was that of the day on which, returning from my
<BR>visit to Mr. Burns in the hospital, I had found the
<BR>excellent doctor waiting for me in the cabin; and
<BR>when he told me that he had been putting in
<BR>time inspecting the medicine chest for me.&nbsp; How
<BR>bizarre!&nbsp; While expecting me to come in at any
<BR>moment he had been amusing himself by writing
<BR>me a letter, and then as I came in had hastened to
<BR>stuff it into the medicine-chest drawer.&nbsp; A rather
<BR>incredible proceeding.&nbsp; I turned to the text in
<BR>wonder.

<P>In a large, hurried, but legible hand the good,
<BR>sympathetic man for some reason, either of kind-
<BR>ness or more likely impelled by the irresistible de-
<BR>sire to express his opinion, with which he didn't
<BR>want to damp my hopes before, was warning me
<BR>not to put my trust in the beneficial effects of a
<BR>change from land to sea.&nbsp; "I didn't want to add to
<BR>your worries by discouraging your hopes," he
<BR>wrote.&nbsp; "I am afraid that, medically speaking, the
<BR>end of your troubles is not yet."&nbsp; In short, he ex-
<BR>pected me to have to fight a probable return of
<BR>tropical illness.&nbsp; Fortunately I had a good pro-
<BR>vision of quinine.&nbsp; I should put my trust in that,
<BR>and administer it steadily, when the ship's health
<BR>would certainly improve.

<P>I crumpled up the letter and rammed it into my
<BR>pocket.&nbsp; Ransome carried off two big doses to the
<BR>men forward.&nbsp; As to myself, I did not go on deck as
<BR>yet.&nbsp; I went instead to the door of Mr. Burns'
<BR>room, and gave him that news, too.

<P>It was impossible to say the effect it had on him.
<BR>At first I thought that he was speechless.&nbsp; His head
<BR>lay sunk in the pillow.&nbsp; He moved his lips enough,
<BR>however, to assure me that he was getting much
<BR>stronger; a statement shockingly untrue on the
<BR>face of it.

<P>That afternoon I took my watch as a matter of
<BR>course.&nbsp; A great over-heated stillness enveloped
<BR>the ship and seemed to hold her motionless in a
<BR>flaming ambience composed in two shades of blue.
<BR>Faint, hot puffs eddied nervelessly from her sails.
<BR>And yet she moved.&nbsp; She must have.&nbsp; For, as the
<BR>sun was setting, we had drawn abreast of Cape
<BR>Liant and dropped it behind us: an ominous re-
<BR>treating shadow in the last gleams of twilight.

<P>In the evening, under the crude glare of his lamp,
<BR>Mr. Burns seemed to have come more to the surface
<BR>of his bedding.&nbsp; It was as if a depressing hand had
<BR>been lifted off him.&nbsp; He answered my few words
<BR>by a comparatively long, connected speech.&nbsp; He
<BR>asserted himself strongly.&nbsp; If he escaped being
<BR>smothered by this stagnant heat, he said, he was
<BR>confident that in a very few days he would be able
<BR>to come up on deck and help me.

<P>While he was speaking I trembled lest this effort
<BR>of energy should leave him lifeless before my eyes.
<BR>But I cannot deny that there was something com-
<BR>forting in his willingness.&nbsp; I made a suitable
<BR>reply, but pointed out to him that the only thing
<BR>that could really help us was wind--a fair wind.

<P>He rolled his head impatiently on the pillow.
<BR>And it was not comforting in the least to hear him
<BR>begin to mutter crazily about the late captain, that
<BR>old man buried in latitude 8 d 20', right in our way
<BR>--ambushed at the entrance of the Gulf.

<P>"Are you still thinking of your late captain, Mr.
<BR>Burns?" I said.&nbsp; "I imagine the dead feel no animos-
<BR>ity against the living.&nbsp; They care nothing for them."

<P>"You don't know that one," he breathed out
<BR>feebly.

<P>"No.&nbsp; I didn't know him, and he didn't know
<BR>me.&nbsp; And so he can't have any grievance against
<BR>me, anyway."

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; But there's all the rest of us on board," he
<BR>insisted.

<P>I felt the inexpugnable strength of common sense
<BR>being insidiously menaced by this gruesome, by
<BR>this insane, delusion.&nbsp; And I said:

<P>"You mustn't talk so much.&nbsp; You will tire yourself."

<P>"And there is the ship herself," he persisted in a whisper.

<P>"Now, not a word more," I said, stepping in and
<BR>laying my hand on his cool forehead.&nbsp; It proved to
<BR>me that this atrocious absurdity was rooted in the
<BR>man himself and not in the disease, which, ap-
<BR>parently, had emptied him of every power, mental
<BR>and physical, except that one fixed idea.

<P>I avoided giving Mr. Burns any opening for con-
<BR>versation for the next few days.&nbsp; I merely used to
<BR>throw him a hasty, cheery word when passing his
<BR>door.&nbsp; I believe that if he had had the strength he
<BR>would have called out after me more than once.
<BR>But he hadn't the strength.&nbsp; Ransome, however,
<BR>observed to me one afternoon that the mate
<BR>"seemed to be picking up wonderfully."

<P>"Did he talk any nonsense to you of late?" I
<BR>asked casually.

<P>"No, sir."&nbsp; Ransome was startled by the direct
<BR>question; but, after a pause, he added equably:
<BR>"He told me this morning, sir, that he was sorry he
<BR>had to bury our late captain right in the ship's
<BR>way, as one may say, out of the Gulf."

<P>"Isn't this nonsense enough for you?" I asked,
<BR>looking confidently at the intelligent, quiet face on
<BR>which the secret uneasiness in the man's breast
<BR>had thrown a transparent veil of care.

<P>Ransome didn't know.&nbsp; He had not given a
<BR>thought to the matter.&nbsp; And with a faint smile he
<BR>flitted away from me on his never-ending duties,
<BR>with his usual guarded activity.

<P>Two more days passed.&nbsp; We had advanced a
<BR>little way--a very little way--into the larger space
<BR>of the Gulf of Siam.&nbsp; Seizing eagerly upon the
<BR>elation of the first command thrown into my lap,
<BR>by the agency of Captain Giles, I had yet an uneasy
<BR>feeling that such luck as this has got perhaps to be
<BR>paid for in some way.&nbsp; I had held, professionally, a
<BR>review of my chances.&nbsp; I was competent enough
<BR>for that.&nbsp; At least, I thought so.&nbsp; I had a general
<BR>sense of my preparedness which only a man pur-
<BR>suing a calling he loves can know.&nbsp; That feeling
<BR>seemed to me the most natural thing in the world.
<BR>As natural as breathing.&nbsp; I imagined I could not
<BR>have lived without it.

<P>I don't know what I expected.&nbsp; Perhaps nothing
<BR>else than that special intensity of existence which is
<BR>the quintessence of youthful aspirations.&nbsp; What-
<BR>ever I expected I did not expect to be beset by
<BR>hurricanes.&nbsp; I knew better than that.&nbsp; In the Gulf
<BR>of Siam there are no hurricanes.&nbsp; But neither did I
<BR>expect to find myself bound hand and foot to the
<BR>hopeless extent which was revealed to me as the
<BR>days went on.

<P>Not that the evil spell held us always motionless.
<BR>Mysterious currents drifted us here and there, with
<BR>a stealthy power made manifest only by the chang-
<BR>ing vistas of the islands fringing the east shore of
<BR>the Gulf.&nbsp; And there were winds, too, fitful and
<BR>deceitful.&nbsp; They raised hopes only to dash them
<BR>into the bitterest disappointment, promises of
<BR>advance ending in lost ground, expiring in sighs,
<BR>dying into dumb stillness in which the currents
<BR>had it all their own way--their own inimical
<BR>way.

<P>The island of Koh-ring, a great, black, up-
<BR>heaved ridge amongst a lot of tiny islets, lying
<BR>upon the glassy water like a triton amongst min-
<BR>nows, seemed to be the centre of the fatal circle.&nbsp; It
<BR>seemed impossible to get away from it.&nbsp; Day after
<BR>day it remained in sight.&nbsp; More than once, in a
<BR>favourable breeze, I would take its bearings in the
<BR>fast-ebbing twilight, thinking that it was for the
<BR>last time.&nbsp; Vain hope.&nbsp; A night of fitful airs would
<BR>undo the gains of temporary favour, and the rising
<BR>sun would throw out the black relief of Koh-ringooking.
