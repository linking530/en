<P>THE tattered man stood musing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, he was reg'lar jim-dandy fer nerve,

<P>wa'n't he," said he finally in a little awestruck

<P>voice.&nbsp; "A reg'lar jim-dandy."&nbsp; He thoughtfully

<P>poked one of the docile hands with his foot.&nbsp; "I

<P>wonner where he got 'is stren'th from?&nbsp; I never

<P>seen a man do like that before.&nbsp; It was a funny

<P>thing.&nbsp; Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth desired to screech out his grief.

<P>He was stabbed, but his tongue lay dead in the

<P>tomb of his mouth.&nbsp; He threw himself again

<P>upon the ground and began to brood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tattered man stood musing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look-a-here, pardner," he said, after a time.

<P>He regarded the corpse as he spoke.&nbsp; "He 's up

<P>an' gone, ain't 'e, an' we might as well begin t'

<P>look out fer ol' number one.&nbsp; This here thing is

<P>all over.&nbsp; He 's up an' gone, ain't 'e?&nbsp; An' he 's all

<P>right here.&nbsp; Nobody won't bother 'im.&nbsp; An' I

<P>must say I ain't enjoying any great health m'self

<P>these days."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, awakened by the tattered soldier's

<P>tone, looked quickly up.&nbsp; He saw that he was

<P>swinging uncertainly on his legs and that his face

<P>had turned to a shade of blue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good Lord!" he cried, "you ain't goin' t'--

<P>not you, too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tattered man waved his hand.&nbsp; "Nary

<P>die," he said.&nbsp; "All I want is some pea soup an'

<P>a good bed.&nbsp; Some pea soup," he repeated

<P>dreamfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth arose from the ground.&nbsp; "I wonder

<P>where he came from.&nbsp; I left him over there."

<P>He pointed.&nbsp; "And now I find 'im here.&nbsp; And

<P>he was coming from over there, too."&nbsp; He in-

<P>dicated a new direction.&nbsp; They both turned

<P>toward the body as if to ask of it a question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," at length spoke the tattered man,

<P>"there ain't no use in our stayin' here an' tryin' t'

<P>ask him anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth nodded an assent wearily.&nbsp; They

<P>both turned to gaze for a moment at the corpse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth murmured something.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, he was a jim-dandy, wa'n't 'e?" said

<P>the tattered man as if in response.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They turned their backs upon it and started

<P>away.&nbsp; For a time they stole softly, treading

<P>with their toes.&nbsp; It remained laughing there in

<P>the grass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm commencin' t' feel pretty bad," said the

<P>tattered man, suddenly breaking one of his little

<P>silences.&nbsp; "I'm commencin' t' feel pretty damn'

<P>bad."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth groaned.&nbsp; "O Lord!"&nbsp; He won-

<P>dered if he was to be the tortured witness of

<P>another grim encounter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his companion waved his hand reassur-

<P>ingly.&nbsp; "Oh, I'm not goin' t' die yit!&nbsp; There too

<P>much dependin' on me fer me t' die yit.&nbsp; No, sir!

<P>Nary die!&nbsp; I CAN'T!&nbsp; Ye'd oughta see th' swad

<P>a' chil'ren I've got, an' all like that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth glancing at his companion could

<P>see by the shadow of a smile that he was making

<P>some kind of fun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they plodded on the tattered soldier con-

<P>tinued to talk.&nbsp; "Besides, if I died, I wouldn't

<P>die th' way that feller did.&nbsp; That was th' funniest

<P>thing.&nbsp; I'd jest flop down, I would.&nbsp; I never seen

<P>a feller die th' way that feller did.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh know Tom Jamison, he lives next door

<P>t' me up home.&nbsp; He's a nice feller, he is, an' we

<P>was allus good friends.&nbsp; Smart, too.&nbsp; Smart as a

<P>steel trap.&nbsp; Well, when we was a-fightin' this

<P>atternoon, all-of-a-sudden he begin t' rip up an'

<P>cuss an' beller at me.&nbsp; 'Yer shot, yeh blamed

<P>infernal!'--he swear horrible--he ses t' me.&nbsp; I

<P>put up m' hand t' m' head an' when I looked at

<P>m' fingers, I seen, sure 'nough, I was shot.&nbsp; I

<P>give a holler an' begin t' run, but b'fore I could

<P>git away another one hit me in th' arm an' whirl'

<P>me clean 'round.&nbsp; I got skeared when they was

<P>all a-shootin' b'hind me an' I run t' beat all,

<P>but I cotch it pretty bad.&nbsp; I've an idee I'd

<P>a' been fightin' yit, if t'was n't fer Tom Jami-

<P>son."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then he made a calm announcement: "There's

<P>two of 'em--little ones--but they 're beginnin' t'

<P>have fun with me now.&nbsp; I don't b'lieve I kin walk

<P>much furder."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They went slowly on in silence.&nbsp; "Yeh look

<P>pretty peek-ed yerself," said the tattered man at

<P>last.&nbsp; "I bet yeh 've got a worser one than yeh

<P>think.&nbsp; Ye'd better take keer of yer hurt.&nbsp; It

<P>don't do t' let sech things go.&nbsp; It might be inside

<P>mostly, an' them plays thunder.&nbsp; Where is it

<P>located?"&nbsp; But he continued his harangue with-

<P>out waiting for a reply.&nbsp; "I see 'a feller git hit

<P>plum in th' head when my reg'ment was a-standin'

<P>at ease onct.&nbsp; An' everybody yelled out to 'im:

<P>Hurt, John?&nbsp; Are yeh hurt much?&nbsp; 'No," ses he.

<P>He looked kinder surprised, an' he went on tellin'

<P>'em how he felt.&nbsp; He sed he didn't feel nothin'.

<P>But, by dad, th' first thing that feller knowed he

<P>was dead.&nbsp; Yes, he was dead--stone dead.&nbsp; So,

<P>yeh wanta watch out.&nbsp; Yeh might have some

<P>queer kind 'a hurt yerself.&nbsp; Yeh can't never tell.

<P>Where is your'n located?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had been wriggling since the intro-

<P>duction of this topic.&nbsp; He now gave a cry of ex-

<P>asperation and made a furious motion with his

<P>hand.&nbsp; "Oh, don't bother me!" he said.&nbsp; He was

<P>enraged against the tattered man, and could have

<P>strangled him.&nbsp; His companions seemed ever to

<P>play intolerable parts.&nbsp; They were ever uprais-

<P>ing the ghost of shame on the stick of their

<P>curiosity.&nbsp; He turned toward the tattered man as

<P>one at bay.&nbsp; "Now, don't bother me," he re-

<P>peated with desperate menace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Lord knows I don't wanta bother any-

<P>body," said the other.&nbsp; There was a little accent

<P>of despair in his voice as he replied, "Lord

<P>knows I 've gota 'nough m' own t' tend to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, who had been holding a bitter de-

<P>bate with himself and casting glances of hatred

<P>and contempt at the tattered man, here spoke in

<P>a hard voice.&nbsp; "Good-by," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tattered man looked at him in gaping

<P>amazement.&nbsp; "Why--why, pardner, where yeh

<P>goin'?" he asked unsteadily.&nbsp; The youth looking

<P>at him, could see that he, too, like that other one,

<P>was beginning to act dumb and animal-like.&nbsp; His

<P>thoughts seemed to be floundering about in his

<P>head.&nbsp; "Now--now--look--a--here, you Tom

<P>Jamison--now--I won't have this--this here

<P>won't do.&nbsp; Where--where yeh goin'?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth pointed vaguely.&nbsp; "Over there,"

<P>he replied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, now look--a--here--now," said the

<P>tattered man, rambling on in idiot fashion.&nbsp; His

<P>head was hanging forward and his words were

<P>slurred.&nbsp; "This thing won't do, now, Tom Jami-

<P>son.&nbsp; It won't do.&nbsp; I know yeh, yeh pig-headed

<P>devil.&nbsp; Yeh wanta go trompin' off with a bad

<P>hurt.&nbsp; It ain't right--now--Tom Jamison--it ain't.

<P>Yeh wanta leave me take keer of yeh, Tom Jami-

<P>son.&nbsp; It ain't--right--it ain't--fer yeh t' go--

<P>trompin' off--with a bad hurt--it ain't--ain't--

<P>ain't right--it ain't."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In reply the youth climbed a fence and

<P>started away.&nbsp; He could hear the tattered man

<P>bleating plaintively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he faced about angrily.&nbsp; "What?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look--a--here, now, Tom Jamison--now--

<P>it ain't--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth went on.&nbsp; Turning at a distance he

<P>saw the tattered man wandering about helplessly

<P>in the field.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He now thought that he wished he was dead.

<P>He believed that he envied those men whose

<P>bodies lay strewn over the grass of the fields and

<P>on the fallen leaves of the forest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The simple questions of the tattered man had

<P>been knife thrusts to him.&nbsp; They asserted a

<P>society that probes pitilessly at secrets until all is

<P>apparent.&nbsp; His late companion's chance persist-

<P>ency made him feel that he could not keep his

<P>crime concealed in his bosom.&nbsp; It was sure to be

<P>brought plain by one of those arrows which

<P>cloud the air and are constantly pricking, dis-

<P>covering, proclaiming those things which are

<P>willed to be forever hidden.&nbsp; He admitted that

<P>he could not defend himself against this agency.

<P>It was not within the power of vigilance.
