<P>THE ragged line had respite for some min-

<P>utes, but during its pause the struggle in the

<P>forest became magnified until the trees seemed to

<P>quiver from the firing and the ground to shake

<P>from the rushing of the men.&nbsp; The voices of the

<P>cannon were mingled in a long and interminable

<P>row.&nbsp; It seemed difficult to live in such an atmos-

<P>phere.&nbsp; The chests of the men strained for a bit

<P>of freshness, and their throats craved water.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was one shot through the body, who

<P>raised a cry of bitter lamentation when came this

<P>lull.&nbsp; Perhaps he had been calling out during

<P>the fighting also, but at that time no one had

<P>heard him.&nbsp; But now the men turned at the woe-

<P>ful complaints of him upon the ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who is it?&nbsp; Who is it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's Jimmie Rogers.&nbsp; Jimmie Rogers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When their eyes first encountered him there

<P>was a sudden halt, as if they feared to go near.

<P>He was thrashing about in the grass, twisting his
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>171

<P>shuddering body into many strange postures.

<P>He was screaming loudly.&nbsp; This instant's hesita-

<P>tion seemed to fill him with a tremendous, fantas-

<P>tic contempt, and he damned them in shrieked

<P>sentences.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's friend had a geographical illusion

<P>concerning a stream, and he obtained permission

<P>to go for some water.&nbsp; Immediately canteens

<P>were showered upon him.&nbsp; "Fill mine, will

<P>yeh?"&nbsp; "Bring me some, too."&nbsp; "And me, too."

<P>He departed, ladened.&nbsp; The youth went with his

<P>friend, feeling a desire to throw his heated body

<P>onto the stream and, soaking there, drink quarts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They made a hurried search for the supposed

<P>stream, but did not find it.&nbsp; "No water here,"

<P>said the youth.&nbsp; They turned without delay and

<P>began to retrace their steps.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From their position as they again faced to-

<P>ward the place of the fighting, they could of

<P>course comprehend a greater amount of the bat-

<P>tle than when their visions had been blurred by

<P>the hurling smoke of the line.&nbsp; They could see

<P>dark stretches winding along the land, and on

<P>one cleared space there was a row of guns mak-

<P>ing gray clouds, which were filled with large

<P>flashes of orange-colored flame.&nbsp; Over some foli-

<P>age they could see the roof of a house.&nbsp; One win-

<P>dow, glowing a deep murder red, shone squarely

<P>through the leaves.&nbsp; From the edifice a tall lean-

<P>ing tower of smoke went far into the sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Looking over their own troops, they saw

<P>mixed masses slowly getting into regular form.

<P>The sunlight made twinkling points of the bright

<P>steel.&nbsp; To the rear there was a glimpse of a dis-

<P>tant roadway as it curved over a slope.&nbsp; It was

<P>crowded with retreating infantry.&nbsp; From all the

<P>interwoven forest arose the smoke and bluster

<P>of the battle.&nbsp; The air was always occupied by

<P>a blaring.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Near where they stood shells were flip-flap-

<P>ping and hooting.&nbsp; Occasional bullets buzzed in

<P>the air and spanged into tree trunks.&nbsp; Wounded

<P>men and other stragglers were slinking through

<P>the woods.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Looking down an aisle of the grove, the

<P>youth and his companion saw a jangling general

<P>and his staff almost ride upon a wounded man,

<P>who was crawling on his hands and knees.&nbsp; The

<P>general reined strongly at his charger's opened

<P>and foamy mouth and guided it with dexterous

<P>horsemanship past the man.&nbsp; The latter scram-

<P>bled in wild and torturing haste.&nbsp; His strength

<P>evidently failed him as he reached a place of

<P>safety.&nbsp; One of his arms suddenly weakened, and

<P>he fell, sliding over upon his back.&nbsp; He lay

<P>stretched out, breathing gently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A moment later the small, creaking cavalcade

<P>was directly in front of the two soldiers.&nbsp; An-

<P>other officer, riding with the skillful abandon of a

<P>cowboy, galloped his horse to a position directly

<P>before the general.&nbsp; The two unnoticed foot sol-

<P>diers made a little show of going on, but they

<P>lingered near in the desire to overhear the con-

<P>versation.&nbsp; Perhaps, they thought, some great

<P>inner historical things would be said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The general, whom the boys knew as the com-

<P>mander of their division, looked at the other

<P>officer and spoke coolly, as if he were criticising

<P>his clothes.&nbsp; "Th' enemy's formin' over there for

<P>another charge," he said.&nbsp; "It'll be directed

<P>against Whiterside, an' I fear they'll break

<P>through there unless we work like thunder t' stop

<P>them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The other swore at his restive horse, and then

<P>cleared his throat.&nbsp; He made a gesture toward

<P>his cap.&nbsp; "It'll be hell t' pay stoppin' them," he

<P>said shortly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I presume so," remarked the general.&nbsp; Then

<P>he began to talk rapidly and in a lower tone.&nbsp; He

<P>frequently illustrated his words with a pointing

<P>finger.&nbsp; The two infantrymen could hear nothing

<P>until finally he asked: "What troops can you

<P>spare?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The officer who rode like a cowboy reflected

<P>for an instant.&nbsp; "Well," he said, "I had to order

<P>in th' 12th to help th' 76th, an' I haven't really got

<P>any.&nbsp; But there's th' 304th.&nbsp; They fight like a

<P>lot 'a mule drivers.&nbsp; I can spare them best

<P>of any."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth and his friend exchanged glances

<P>of astonishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The general spoke sharply.&nbsp; "Get 'em ready,

<P>then.&nbsp; I'll watch developments from here, an'

<P>send you word when t' start them.&nbsp; It'll happen

<P>in five minutes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the other officer tossed his fingers toward

<P>his cap and wheeling his horse, started away, the

<P>general called out to him in a sober voice: "I

<P>don't believe many of your mule drivers will get

<P>back."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The other shouted something in reply.&nbsp; He

<P>smiled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With scared faces, the youth and his compan-

<P>ion hurried back to the line.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These happenings had occupied an incredibly

<P>short time, yet the youth felt that in them he had

<P>been made aged.&nbsp; New eyes were given to him.

<P>And the most startling thing was to learn sud-

<P>denly that he was very insignificant.&nbsp; The officer

<P>spoke of the regiment as if he referred to a

<P>broom.&nbsp; Some part of the woods needed sweep-

<P>ing, perhaps, and he merely indicated a broom in

<P>a tone properly indifferent to its fate.&nbsp; It was

<P>war, no doubt, but it appeared strange.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the two boys approached the line, the lieu-

<P>tenant perceived them and swelled with wrath.

<P>"Fleming--Wilson--how long does it take yeh

<P>to git water, anyhow--where yeh been to."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his oration ceased as he saw their eyes,

<P>which were large with great tales.&nbsp; "We're goin'

<P>t' charge--we're goin' t' charge!" cried the

<P>youth's friend, hastening with his news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Charge?" said the lieutenant.&nbsp; "Charge?

<P>Well, b'Gawd!&nbsp; Now, this is real fightin'."&nbsp; Over

<P>his soiled countenance there went a boastful

<P>smile.&nbsp; "Charge?&nbsp; Well, b'Gawd!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A little group of soldiers surrounded the two

<P>youths.&nbsp; "Are we, sure 'nough?&nbsp; Well, I'll be

<P>derned!&nbsp; Charge?&nbsp; What fer?&nbsp; What at?&nbsp; Wil-

<P>son, you're lyin'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope to die," said the youth, pitching his

<P>tones to the key of angry remonstrance.&nbsp; "Sure

<P>as shooting, I tell you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And his friend spoke in re-enforcement.&nbsp; "Not

<P>by a blame sight, he ain't lyin'.&nbsp; We heard 'em

<P>talkin'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They caught sight of two mounted figures a

<P>short distance from them.&nbsp; One was the colonel

<P>of the regiment and the other was the officer who

<P>had received orders from the commander of the

<P>division.&nbsp; They were gesticulating at each other.

<P>The soldier, pointing at them, interpreted the

<P>scene.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One man had a final objection: "How could

<P>yeh hear 'em talkin'?"&nbsp; But the men, for a large

<P>part, nodded, admitting that previously the two

<P>friends had spoken truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They settled back into reposeful attitudes

<P>with airs of having accepted the matter.&nbsp; And

<P>they mused upon it, with a hundred varieties of

<P>expression.&nbsp; It was an engrossing thing to think

<P>about.&nbsp; Many tightened their belts carefully and

<P>hitched at their trousers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A moment later the officers began to bustle

<P>among the men, pushing them into a more com-

<P>pact mass and into a better alignment.&nbsp; They

<P>chased those that straggled and fumed at a few

<P>men who seemed to show by their attitudes that

<P>they had decided to remain at that spot.&nbsp; They

<P>were like critical shepherds struggling with sheep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently, the regiment seemed to draw itself

<P>up and heave a deep breath.&nbsp; None of the men's

<P>faces were mirrors of large thoughts.&nbsp; The sol-

<P>diers were bended and stooped like sprinters be-

<P>fore a signal.&nbsp; Many pairs of glinting eyes peered

<P>from the grimy faces toward the curtains of the

<P>deeper woods.&nbsp; They seemed to be engaged in

<P>deep calculations of time and distance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were surrounded by the noises of the

<P>monstrous altercation between the two armies.

<P>The world was fully interested in other matters.

<P>Apparently, the regiment had its small affair to

<P>itself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, turning, shot a quick, inquiring

<P>glance at his friend.&nbsp; The latter returned to him

<P>the same manner of look.&nbsp; They were the only

<P>ones who possessed an inner knowledge.&nbsp; "Mule

<P>drivers--hell t' pay--don't believe many will get

<P>back."&nbsp; It was an ironical secret.&nbsp; Still, they saw

<P>no hesitation in each other's faces, and they nod-

<P>ded a mute and unprotesting assent when a shag-

<P>gy man near them said in a meek voice: "We'll

<P>git swallowed."
