<P>THE youth awakened slowly.&nbsp; He came grad-

<P>ually back to a position from which he could re-

<P>gard himself.&nbsp; For moments he had been scruti-

<P>nizing his person in a dazed way as if he had

<P>never before seen himself.&nbsp; Then he picked up

<P>his cap from the ground.&nbsp; He wriggled in his

<P>jacket to make a more comfortable fit, and kneel-

<P>ing relaced his shoe.&nbsp; He thoughtfully mopped

<P>his reeking features.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So it was all over at last!&nbsp; The supreme trial

<P>had been passed.&nbsp; The red, formidable difficulties

<P>of war had been vanquished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went into an ecstasy of self-satisfaction.

<P>He had the most delightful sensations of his life.

<P>Standing as if apart from himself, he viewed that

<P>last scene.&nbsp; He perceived that the man who had

<P>fought thus was magnificent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He felt that he was a fine fellow.&nbsp; He saw

<P>himself even with those ideals which he had con-

<P>sidered as far beyond him.&nbsp; He smiled in deep

<P>gratification.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon his fellows he beamed tenderness and

<P>good will.&nbsp; "Gee! ain't it hot, hey?" he said

<P>affably to a man who was polishing his stream-

<P>ing face with his coat sleeves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You bet!" said the other, grinning sociably.

<P>"I never seen sech dumb hotness."&nbsp; He sprawled

<P>out luxuriously on the ground.&nbsp; "Gee, yes!&nbsp; An'

<P>I hope we don't have no more fightin' till a week

<P>from Monday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were some handshakings and deep

<P>speeches with men whose features were familiar,

<P>but with whom the youth now felt the bonds of

<P>tied hearts.&nbsp; He helped a cursing comrade to

<P>bind up a wound of the shin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, of a sudden, cries of amazement broke

<P>out along the ranks of the new regiment.&nbsp; "Here

<P>they come ag'in!&nbsp; Here they come ag'in!"&nbsp; The

<P>man who had sprawled upon the ground started

<P>up and said, "Gosh!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth turned quick eyes upon the field.

<P>He discerned forms begin to swell in masses out

<P>of a distant wood.&nbsp; He again saw the tilted flag

<P>speeding forward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The shells, which had ceased to trouble the

<P>regiment for a time, came swirling again, and ex-

<P>ploded in the grass or among the leaves of the

<P>trees.&nbsp; They looked to be strange war flowers

<P>bursting into fierce bloom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men groaned.&nbsp; The luster faded from

<P>their eyes.&nbsp; Their smudged countenances now

<P>expressed a profound dejection.&nbsp; They moved

<P>their stiffened bodies slowly, and watched in sul-

<P>len mood the frantic approach of the enemy.&nbsp; The

<P>slaves toiling in the temple of this god began to

<P>feel rebellion at his harsh tasks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They fretted and complained each to each.

<P>"Oh, say, this is too much of a good thing!&nbsp; Why

<P>can't somebody send us supports?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We ain't never goin' to stand this second

<P>banging.&nbsp; I didn't come here to fight the hull

<P>damn' rebel army."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was one who raised a doleful cry.&nbsp; "I

<P>wish Bill Smithers had trod on my hand, in-

<P>steader me treddin' on his'n."&nbsp; The sore joints of

<P>the regiment creaked as it painfully floundered

<P>into position to repulse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth stared.&nbsp; Surely, he thought, this

<P>impossible thing was not about to happen.&nbsp; He

<P>waited as if he expected the enemy to suddenly

<P>stop, apologize, and retire bowing.&nbsp; It was all a

<P>mistake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the firing began somewhere on the regi-

<P>mental line and ripped along in both directions.

<P>The level sheets of flame developed great clouds

<P>of smoke that tumbled and tossed in the mild

<P>wind near the ground for a moment, and then

<P>rolled through the ranks as through a gate.&nbsp; The

<P>clouds were tinged an earthlike yellow in the

<P>sunrays and in the shadow were a sorry blue.

<P>The flag was sometimes eaten and lost in this

<P>mass of vapor, but more often it projected, sun-

<P>touched, resplendent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Into the youth's eyes there came a look that

<P>one can see in the orbs of a jaded horse.&nbsp; His

<P>neck was quivering with nervous weakness and

<P>the muscles of his arms felt numb and bloodless.

<P>His hands, too, seemed large and awkward as if

<P>he was wearing invisible mittens.&nbsp; And there was

<P>a great uncertainty about his knee joints.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The words that comrades had uttered previous

<P>to the firing began to recur to him.&nbsp; "Oh, say,

<P>this is too much of a good thing!&nbsp; What do they

<P>take us for--why don't they send supports?&nbsp; I

<P>didn't come here to fight the hull damned rebel

<P>army."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He began to exaggerate the endurance, the

<P>skill, and the valor of those who were coming.

<P>Himself reeling from exhaustion, he was aston-

<P>ished beyond measure at such persistency.&nbsp; They

<P>must be machines of steel.&nbsp; It was very gloomy

<P>struggling against such affairs, wound up perhaps

<P>to fight until sundown.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He slowly lifted his rifle and catching a

<P>glimpse of the thickspread field he blazed at a

<P>cantering cluster.&nbsp; He stopped then and began

<P>to peer as best he could through the smoke.&nbsp; He

<P>caught changing views of the ground covered

<P>with men who were all running like pursued

<P>imps, and yelling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the youth it was an onslaught of redoubt-

<P>able dragons.&nbsp; He became like the man who lost

<P>his legs at the approach of the red and green

<P>monster.&nbsp; He waited in a sort of a horrified,

<P>listening attitude.&nbsp; He seemed to shut his eyes

<P>and wait to be gobbled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A man near him who up to this time had been

<P>working feverishly at his rifle suddenly stopped

<P>and ran with howls.&nbsp; A lad whose face had borne

<P>an expression of exalted courage, the majesty of

<P>he who dares give his life, was, at an instant,

<P>smitten abject.&nbsp; He blanched like one who has

<P>come to the edge of a cliff at midnight and is sud-

<P>denly made aware.&nbsp; There was a revelation.&nbsp; He,

<P>too, threw down his gun and fled.&nbsp; There was no

<P>shame in his face.&nbsp; He ran like a rabbit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Others began to scamper away through the

<P>smoke.&nbsp; The youth turned his head, shaken from

<P>his trance by this movement as if the regiment

<P>was leaving him behind.&nbsp; He saw the few fleeting

<P>forms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He yelled then with fright and swung about.

<P>For a moment, in the great clamor, he was like a

<P>proverbial chicken.&nbsp; He lost the direction of

<P>safety.&nbsp; Destruction threatened him from all

<P>points.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Directly he began to speed toward the rear in

<P>great leaps.&nbsp; His rifle and cap were gone.&nbsp; His

<P>unbuttoned coat bulged in the wind.&nbsp; The flap of

<P>his cartridge box bobbed wildly, and his canteen,

<P>by its slender cord, swung out behind.&nbsp; On his

<P>face was all the horror of those things which he

<P>imagined.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant sprang forward bawling.&nbsp; The

<P>youth saw his features wrathfully red, and saw

<P>him make a dab with his sword.&nbsp; His one thought

<P>of the incident was that the lieutenant was a pecul-

<P>iar creature to feel interested in such matters

<P>upon this occasion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ran like a blind man.&nbsp; Two or three times

<P>he fell down.&nbsp; Once he knocked his shoulder so

<P>heavily against a tree that he went headlong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Since he had turned his back upon the fight

<P>his fears had been wondrously magnified.&nbsp; Death

<P>about to thrust him between the shoulder blades

<P>was far more dreadful than death about to smite

<P>him between the eyes.&nbsp; When he thought of it

<P>later, he conceived the impression that it is better

<P>to view the appalling than to be merely within

<P>hearing.&nbsp; The noises of the battle were like

<P>stones; he believed himself liable to be crushed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he ran he mingled with others.&nbsp; He

<P>dimly saw men on his right and on his left, and

<P>he heard footsteps behind him.&nbsp; He thought that

<P>all the regiment was fleeing, pursued by these

<P>ominous crashes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In his flight the sound of these following foot-

<P>steps gave him his one meager relief.&nbsp; He felt

<P>vaguely that death must make a first choice of

<P>the men who were nearest; the initial morsels for

<P>the dragons would be then those who were fol-

<P>lowing him.&nbsp; So he displayed the zeal of an insane

<P>sprinter in his purpose to keep them in the rear.

<P>There was a race.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he, leading, went across a little field, he

<P>found himself in a region of shells.&nbsp; They hurtled

<P>over his head with long wild screams.&nbsp; As he

<P>listened he imagined them to have rows of cruel

<P>teeth that grinned at him.&nbsp; Once one lit before

<P>him and the livid lightning of the explosion

<P>effectually barred the way in his chosen direc-

<P>tion.&nbsp; He groveled on the ground and then

<P>springing up went careering off through some

<P>bushes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He experienced a thrill of amazement when

<P>he came within view of a battery in action.&nbsp; The

<P>men there seemed to be in conventional moods,

<P>altogether unaware of the impending annihila-

<P>tion.&nbsp; The battery was disputing with a distant

<P>antagonist and the gunners were wrapped in

<P>admiration of their shooting.&nbsp; They were con-

<P>tinually bending in coaxing postures over the

<P>guns.&nbsp; They seemed to be patting them on the

<P>back and encouraging them with words.&nbsp; The

<P>guns, stolid and undaunted, spoke with dogged

<P>valor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The precise gunners were coolly enthusiastic.

<P>They lifted their eyes every chance to the smoke-

<P>wreathed hillock from whence the hostile battery

<P>addressed them.&nbsp; The youth pitied them as he

<P>ran.&nbsp; Methodical idiots!&nbsp; Machine-like fools!&nbsp; The

<P>refined joy of planting shells in the midst of the

<P>other battery's formation would appear a little

<P>thing when the infantry came swooping out of

<P>the woods.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The face of a youthful rider, who was jerking

<P>his frantic horse with an abandon of temper

<P>he might display in a placid barnyard, was im-

<P>pressed deeply upon his mind.&nbsp; He knew that

<P>he looked upon a man who would presently be

<P>dead.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Too, he felt a pity for the guns, standing, six

<P>good comrades, in a bold row.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He saw a brigade going to the relief of its pes-

<P>tered fellows.&nbsp; He scrambled upon a wee hill and

<P>watched it sweeping finely, keeping formation in

<P>difficult places.&nbsp; The blue of the line was crusted

<P>with steel color, and the brilliant flags projected.

<P>Officers were shouting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This sight also filled him with wonder.&nbsp; The

<P>brigade was hurrying briskly to be gulped into

<P>the infernal mouths of the war god.&nbsp; What man-

<P>ner of men were they, anyhow?&nbsp; Ah, it was some

<P>wondrous breed!&nbsp; Or else they didn't compre-

<P>hend--the fools.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A furious order caused commotion in the artil-

<P>lery.&nbsp; An officer on a bounding horse made mani-

<P>acal motions with his arms.&nbsp; The teams went

<P>swinging up from the rear, the guns were whirled

<P>about, and the battery scampered away.&nbsp; The

<P>cannon with their noses poked slantingly at the

<P>ground grunted and grumbled like stout men,

<P>brave but with objections to hurry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth went on, moderating his pace since

<P>he had left the place of noises.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Later he came upon a general of division

<P>seated upon a horse that pricked its ears in

<P>an interested way at the battle.&nbsp; There was a

<P>great gleaming of yellow and patent leather

<P>about the saddle and bridle.&nbsp; The quiet man

<P>astride looked mouse-colored upon such a splen-

<P>did charger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A jingling staff was galloping hither and

<P>thither.&nbsp; Sometimes the general was surrounded

<P>by horsemen and at other times he was quite

<P>alone.&nbsp; He looked to be much harassed.&nbsp; He had

<P>the appearance of a business man whose market

<P>is swinging up and down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth went slinking around this spot.

<P>He went as near as he dared trying to overhear

<P>words.&nbsp; Perhaps the general, unable to compre-

<P>hend chaos, might call upon him for information.

<P>And he could tell him.&nbsp; He knew all concerning

<P>it.&nbsp; Of a surety the force was in a fix, and any

<P>fool could see that if they did not retreat while

<P>they had opportunity--why--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He felt that he would like to thrash the gen-

<P>eral, or at least approach and tell him in plain

<P>words exactly what he thought him to be.&nbsp; It

<P>was criminal to stay calmly in one spot and make

<P>no effort to stay destruction.&nbsp; He loitered in a

<P>fever of eagerness for the division commander to

<P>apply to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he warily moved about, he heard the gen-

<P>eral call out irritably: "Tompkins, go over an'

<P>see Taylor, an' tell him not t' be in such an all-

<P>fired hurry; tell him t' halt his brigade in th'

<P>edge of th' woods; tell him t' detach a reg'ment

<P>--say I think th' center 'll break if we don't help

<P>it out some; tell him t' hurry up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught

<P>these swift words from the mouth of his superior.

<P>He made his horse bound into a gallop almost

<P>from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission.

<P>There was a cloud of dust.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A moment later the youth saw the general

<P>bounce excitedly in his saddle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, by heavens, they have!"&nbsp; The officer

<P>leaned forward.&nbsp; His face was aflame with excite-

<P>ment.&nbsp; "Yes, by heavens, they 've held 'im!

<P>They 've held 'im!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He began to blithely roar at his staff: "We 'll

<P>wallop 'im now.&nbsp; We 'll wallop 'im now.&nbsp; We 've

<P>got 'em sure."&nbsp; He turned suddenly upon an aid:

<P>"Here--you--Jones--quick--ride after Tompkins

<P>--see Taylor--tell him t' go in--everlastingly--

<P>like blazes--anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As another officer sped his horse after the first

<P>messenger, the general beamed upon the earth

<P>like a sun.&nbsp; In his eyes was a desire to chant a

<P>paean.&nbsp; He kept repeating, "They 've held 'em,

<P>by heavens!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His excitement made his horse plunge, and he

<P>merrily kicked and swore at it.&nbsp; He held a little

<P>carnival of joy on horseback.
