<P>THIS advance of the enemy had seemed to the

<P>youth like a ruthless hunting.&nbsp; He began to fume

<P>with rage and exasperation.&nbsp; He beat his foot

<P>upon the ground, and scowled with hate at the

<P>swirling smoke that was approaching like a phan-

<P>tom flood.&nbsp; There was a maddening quality in

<P>this seeming resolution of the foe to give him no

<P>rest, to give him no time to sit down and think.

<P>Yesterday he had fought and had fled rapidly.

<P>There had been many adventures.&nbsp; For to-day he

<P>felt that he had earned opportunities for contem-

<P>plative repose.&nbsp; He could have enjoyed portraying

<P>to uninitiated listeners various scenes at which he

<P>had been a witness or ably discussing the pro-

<P>cesses of war with other proved men.&nbsp; Too it was

<P>important that he should have time for physical

<P>recuperation.&nbsp; He was sore and stiff from his ex-

<P>periences.&nbsp; He had received his fill of all exer-

<P>tions, and he wished to rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But those other men seemed never to grow

<P>weary; they were fighting with their old speed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>163

<P>He had a wild hate for the relentless foe.&nbsp; Yester-

<P>day, when he had imagined the universe to be

<P>against him, he had hated it, little gods and big

<P>gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe with

<P>the same great hatred.&nbsp; He was not going to be

<P>badgered of his life, like a kitten chased by boys,

<P>he said.&nbsp; It was not well to drive men into final

<P>corners; at those moments they could all develop

<P>teeth and claws.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He leaned and spoke into his friend's ear.&nbsp; He

<P>menaced the woods with a gesture.&nbsp; "If they

<P>keep on chasing us, by Gawd, they'd better watch

<P>out.&nbsp; Can't stand TOO much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend twisted his head and made a calm

<P>reply.&nbsp; "If they keep on a-chasin' us they'll drive

<P>us all inteh th' river."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth cried out savagely at this state-

<P>ment.&nbsp; He crouched behind a little tree, with his

<P>eyes burning hatefully and his teeth set in a cur-

<P>like snarl.&nbsp; The awkward bandage was still about

<P>his head, and upon it, over his wound, there was

<P>a spot of dry blood.&nbsp; His hair was wondrously

<P>tousled, and some straggling, moving locks hung

<P>over the cloth of the bandage down toward his

<P>forehead.&nbsp; His jacket and shirt were open at the

<P>throat, and exposed his young bronzed neck.

<P>There could be seen spasmodic gulpings at his

<P>throat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His fingers twined nervously about his rifle.

<P>He wished that it was an engine of annihilating

<P>power.&nbsp; He felt that he and his companions were

<P>being taunted and derided from sincere convic-

<P>tions that they were poor and puny.&nbsp; His knowl-

<P>edge of his inability to take vengeance for it made

<P>his rage into a dark and stormy specter, that pos-

<P>sessed him and made him dream of abominable

<P>cruelties.&nbsp; The tormentors were flies sucking in-

<P>solently at his blood, and he thought that he would

<P>have given his life for a revenge of seeing their

<P>faces in pitiful plights.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The winds of battle had swept all about the

<P>regiment, until the one rifle, instantly followed by

<P>others, flashed in its front.&nbsp; A moment later the

<P>regiment roared forth its sudden and valiant re-

<P>tort.&nbsp; A dense wall of smoke settled slowly down.

<P>It was furiously slit and slashed by the knifelike

<P>fire from the rifles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the youth the fighters resembled animals

<P>tossed for a death struggle into a dark pit.&nbsp; There

<P>was a sensation that he and his fellows, at bay,

<P>were pushing back, always pushing fierce on-

<P>slaughts of creatures who were slippery.&nbsp; Their

<P>beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase upon

<P>the bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade

<P>them with ease, and come through, between,

<P>around, and about with unopposed skill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When, in a dream, it occurred to the youth

<P>that his rifle was an impotent stick, he lost sense

<P>of everything but his hate, his desire to smash

<P>into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he

<P>could feel upon the faces of his enemies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blue smoke-swallowed line curled and

<P>writhed like a snake stepped upon.&nbsp; It swung its

<P>ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth was not conscious that he was erect

<P>upon his feet.&nbsp; He did not know the direction of

<P>the ground.&nbsp; Indeed, once he even lost the habit

<P>of balance and fell heavily.&nbsp; He was up again

<P>immediately.&nbsp; One thought went through the

<P>chaos of his brain at the time.&nbsp; He wondered if

<P>he had fallen because he had been shot.&nbsp; But the

<P>suspicion flew away at once.&nbsp; He did not think

<P>more of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had taken up a first position behind the lit-

<P>tle tree, with a direct determination to hold it

<P>against the world.&nbsp; He had not deemed it possi-

<P>ble that his army could that day succeed, and

<P>from this he felt the ability to fight harder.&nbsp; But

<P>the throng had surged in all ways, until he lost

<P>directions and locations, save that he knew where

<P>lay the enemy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The flames bit him, and the hot smoke broiled

<P>his skin.&nbsp; His rifle barrel grew so hot that ordi-

<P>narily he could not have borne it upon his palms;

<P>but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it, and

<P>pounding them with his clanking, bending ram-

<P>rod.&nbsp; If he aimed at some changing form through

<P>the smoke, he pulled his trigger with a fierce

<P>grunt, as if he were dealing a blow of the fist with

<P>all his strength.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the enemy seemed falling back before

<P>him and his fellows, he went instantly forward,

<P>like a dog who, seeing his foes lagging, turns and

<P>insists upon being pursued.&nbsp; And when he was

<P>compelled to retire again, he did it slowly, sul-

<P>lenly, taking steps of wrathful despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he, in his intent hate, was almost alone,

<P>and was firing, when all those near him had ceased.

<P>He was so engrossed in his occupation that he

<P>was not aware of a lull.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was recalled by a hoarse laugh and a sen-

<P>tence that came to his ears in a voice of contempt

<P>and amazement.&nbsp; "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh

<P>know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t'

<P>shoot at?&nbsp; Good Gawd!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned then and, pausing with his rifle

<P>thrown half into position, looked at the blue line

<P>of his comrades.&nbsp; During this moment of leisure

<P>they seemed all to be engaged in staring with

<P>astonishment at him.&nbsp; They had become specta-

<P>tors.&nbsp; Turning to the front again he saw, under

<P>the lifted smoke, a deserted ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked bewildered for a moment.&nbsp; Then

<P>there appeared upon the glazed vacancy of his

<P>eyes a diamond point of intelligence.&nbsp; "Oh," he

<P>said, comprehending.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He returned to his comrades and threw him-

<P>self upon the ground.&nbsp; He sprawled like a man

<P>who had been thrashed.&nbsp; His flesh seemed strange-

<P>ly on fire, and the sounds of the battle continued

<P>in his ears.&nbsp; He groped blindly for his canteen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant was crowing.&nbsp; He seemed

<P>drunk with fighting.&nbsp; He called out to the youth:

<P>"By heavens, if I had ten thousand wild cats like

<P>you I could tear th' stomach outa this war in

<P>less'n a week!"&nbsp; He puffed out his chest with

<P>large dignity as he said it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some of the men muttered and looked at the

<P>youth in awe-struck ways.&nbsp; It was plain that as

<P>he had gone on loading and firing and cursing

<P>without the proper intermission, they had found

<P>time to regard him.&nbsp; And they now looked upon

<P>him as a war devil.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend came staggering to him.&nbsp; There

<P>was some fright and dismay in his voice.&nbsp; "Are yeh

<P>all right, Fleming?&nbsp; Do yeh feel all right?&nbsp; There

<P>ain't nothin' th' matter with yeh, Henry, is there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said the youth with difficulty.&nbsp; His

<P>throat seemed full of knobs and burs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These incidents made the youth ponder.&nbsp; It

<P>was revealed to him that he had been a barbarian,

<P>a beast.&nbsp; He had fought like a pagan who de-

<P>fends his religion.&nbsp; Regarding it, he saw that it

<P>was fine, wild, and, in some ways, easy.&nbsp; He had

<P>been a tremendous figure, no doubt.&nbsp; By this

<P>struggle he had overcome obstacles which he

<P>had admitted to be mountains.&nbsp; They had fallen

<P>like paper peaks, and he was now what he called

<P>a hero.&nbsp; And he had not been aware of the pro-

<P>cess.&nbsp; He had slept and, awakening, found him-

<P>self a knight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He lay and basked in the occasional stares of

<P>his comrades.&nbsp; Their faces were varied in de-

<P>grees of blackness from the burned powder.

<P>Some were utterly smudged.&nbsp; They were reek-

<P>ing with perspiration, and their breaths came

<P>hard and wheezing.&nbsp; And from these soiled ex-

<P>panses they peered at him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hot work!&nbsp; Hot work!" cried the lieu-

<P>tenant deliriously.&nbsp; He walked up and down,

<P>restless and eager.&nbsp; Sometimes his voice could

<P>be heard in a wild, incomprehensible laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he had a particularly profound thought

<P>upon the science of war he always unconsciously

<P>addressed himself to the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was some grim rejoicing by the men.

<P>"By thunder, I bet this army'll never see another

<P>new reg'ment like us!"

<P>"You bet!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp; "A dog, a woman, an' a walnut tree,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Th' more yeh beat 'em, th' better they be!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That's like us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lost a piler men, they did.&nbsp; If an' ol' woman

<P>swep' up th' woods she'd git a dustpanful."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, an' if she'll come around ag'in in 'bout

<P>an' hour she'll git a pile more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The forest still bore its burden of clamor.

<P>From off under the trees came the rolling clatter

<P>of the musketry.&nbsp; Each distant thicket seemed a

<P>strange porcupine with quills of flame.&nbsp; A cloud

<P>of dark smoke, as from smoldering ruins, went

<P>up toward the sun now bright and gay in the

<P>blue, enameled sky.
