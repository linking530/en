<P>A SPUTTERING of musketry was always to be

<P>heard.&nbsp; Later, the cannon had entered the dis-

<P>pute.&nbsp; In the fog-filled air their voices made a

<P>thudding sound.&nbsp; The reverberations were con-

<P>tinued.&nbsp; This part of the world led a strange,

<P>battleful existence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's regiment was marched to relieve

<P>a command that had lain long in some damp

<P>trenches.&nbsp; The men took positions behind a curv-

<P>ing line of rifle pits that had been turned up, like

<P>a large furrow, along the line of woods.&nbsp; Before

<P>them was a level stretch, peopled with short,

<P>deformed stumps.&nbsp; From the woods beyond

<P>came the dull popping of the skirmishers and

<P>pickets, firing in the fog.&nbsp; From the right came

<P>the noise of a terrific fracas.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men cuddled behind the small embank-

<P>ment and sat in easy attitudes awaiting their

<P>turn.&nbsp; Many had their backs to the firing.&nbsp; The

<P>youth's friend lay down, buried his face in his
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>154

<P>arms, and almost instantly, it seemed, he was in a

<P>deep sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth leaned his breast against the

<P>brown dirt and peered over at the woods and up

<P>and down the line.&nbsp; Curtains of trees interfered

<P>with his ways of vision.&nbsp; He could see the low

<P>line of trenches but for a short distance.&nbsp; A few

<P>idle flags were perched on the dirt hills.&nbsp; Behind

<P>them were rows of dark bodies with a few heads

<P>sticking curiously over the top.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Always the noise of skirmishers came from

<P>the woods on the front and left, and the din on

<P>the right had grown to frightful proportions.

<P>The guns were roaring without an instant's pause

<P>for breath.&nbsp; It seemed that the cannon had come

<P>from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous

<P>wrangle.&nbsp; It became impossible to make a sen-

<P>tence heard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth wished to launch a joke--a quota-

<P>tion from newspapers.&nbsp; He desired to say, "All

<P>quiet on the Rappahannock," but the guns refused

<P>to permit even a comment upon their uproar.

<P>He never successfully concluded the sentence.

<P>But at last the guns stopped, and among the

<P>men in the rifle pits rumors again flew, like birds,

<P>but they were now for the most part black

<P>creatures who flapped their wings drearily near

<P>to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of

<P>hope.&nbsp; The men's faces grew doleful from the

<P>interpreting of omens.&nbsp; Tales of hesitation and

<P>uncertainty on the part of those high in place and

<P>responsibility came to their ears.&nbsp; Stories of

<P>disaster were borne into their minds with many

<P>proofs.&nbsp; This din of musketry on the right, grow-

<P>ing like a released genie of sound, expressed and

<P>emphasized the army's plight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men were disheartened and began to

<P>mutter.&nbsp; They made gestures expressive of the

<P>sentence: "Ah, what more can we do?"&nbsp; And it

<P>could always be seen that they were bewildered

<P>by the alleged news and could not fully compre-

<P>hend a defeat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the gray mists had been totally ob-

<P>literated by the sun rays, the regiment was march-

<P>ing in a spread column that was retiring carefully

<P>through the woods.&nbsp; The disordered, hurrying

<P>lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down

<P>through the groves and little fields.&nbsp; They were

<P>yelling, shrill and exultant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this sight the youth forgot many personal

<P>matters and became greatly enraged.&nbsp; He ex-

<P>ploded in loud sentences.&nbsp; "B'jiminey, we're

<P>generaled by a lot 'a lunkheads."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"More than one feller has said that t'-day,"

<P>observed a man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend, recently aroused, was still very

<P>drowsy.&nbsp; He looked behind him until his mind

<P>took in the meaning of the movement.&nbsp; Then he

<P>sighed.&nbsp; "Oh, well, I s'pose we got licked," he

<P>remarked sadly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had a thought that it would not be

<P>handsome for him to freely condemn other men.

<P>He made an attempt to restrain himself, but the

<P>words upon his tongue were too bitter.&nbsp; He

<P>presently began a long and intricate denunciation

<P>of the commander of the forces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mebbe, it wa'n't all his fault--not all to-

<P>gether.&nbsp; He did th' best he knowed.&nbsp; It's our

<P>luck t' git licked often," said his friend in a weary

<P>tone.&nbsp; He was trudging along with stooped

<P>shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has

<P>been caned and kicked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, don't we fight like the devil?&nbsp; Don't

<P>we do all that men can?" demanded the youth

<P>loudly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment

<P>when it came from his lips.&nbsp; For a moment his

<P>face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about

<P>him.&nbsp; But no one questioned his right to deal in

<P>such words, and presently he recovered his air

<P>of courage.&nbsp; He went on to repeat a statement

<P>he had heard going from group to group at the

<P>camp that morning.&nbsp; "The brigadier said he

<P>never saw a new reg'ment fight the way we

<P>fought yestirday, didn't he?&nbsp; And we didn't do

<P>better than many another reg'ment, did we?

<P>Well, then, you can't say it's th' army's fault, can

<P>you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In his reply, the friend's voice was stern.&nbsp; "'A

<P>course not," he said.&nbsp; "No man dare say we

<P>don't fight like th' devil.&nbsp; No man will ever dare

<P>say it.&nbsp; Th' boys fight like hell-roosters.&nbsp; But

<P>still--still, we don't have no luck."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then, if we fight like the devil an'

<P>don't ever whip, it must be the general's fault,"

<P>said the youth grandly and decisively.&nbsp; "And I

<P>don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and

<P>fighting, yet always losing through some derned

<P>old lunkhead of a general."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A sarcastic man who was tramping at the

<P>youth's side, then spoke lazily.&nbsp; "Mebbe yeh

<P>think yeh fit th' hull battle yestirday, Fleming,"

<P>he remarked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The speech pierced the youth.&nbsp; Inwardly he

<P>was reduced to an abject pulp by these chance

<P>words.&nbsp; His legs quaked privately.&nbsp; He cast a

<P>frightened glance at the sarcastic man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, no," he hastened to say in a concili-

<P>ating voice, "I don't think I fought the whole

<P>battle yesterday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the other seemed innocent of any deeper

<P>meaning.&nbsp; Apparently, he had no information.

<P>It was merely his habit.&nbsp; "Oh!" he replied in the

<P>same tone of calm derision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, nevertheless, felt a threat.&nbsp; His

<P>mind shrank from going near to the danger, and

<P>thereafter he was silent.&nbsp; The significance of the

<P>sarcastic man's words took from him all loud

<P>moods that would make him appear prominent.

<P>He became suddenly a modest person.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was low-toned talk among the troops.

<P>The officers were impatient and snappy, their

<P>countenances clouded with the tales of misfor-

<P>tune.&nbsp; The troops, sifting through the forest,

<P>were sullen.&nbsp; In the youth's company once a

<P>man's laugh rang out.&nbsp; A dozen soldiers turned

<P>their faces quickly toward him and frowned with

<P>vague displeasure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The noise of firing dogged their footsteps.

<P>Sometimes, it seemed to be driven a little way,

<P>but it always returned again with increased

<P>insolence.&nbsp; The men muttered and cursed,

<P>throwing black looks in its direction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a clear space the troops were at last halted.

<P>Regiments and brigades, broken and detached

<P>through their encounters with thickets, grew

<P>together again and lines were faced toward the

<P>pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This noise, following like the yellings of eager,

<P>metallic hounds, increased to a loud and joyous

<P>burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the

<P>sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy

<P>thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings.

<P>The woods began to crackle as if afire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whoop-a-dadee," said a man, "here we are!

<P>Everybody fightin'.&nbsp; Blood an' destruction."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was willin' t' bet they'd attack as soon as

<P>th' sun got fairly up," savagely asserted the

<P>lieutenant who commanded the youth's company.

<P>He jerked without mercy at his little mustache.

<P>He strode to and fro with dark dignity in the

<P>rear of his men, who were lying down behind

<P>whatever protection they had collected.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A battery had trundled into position in the

<P>rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance.

<P>The regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the

<P>moment when the gray shadows of the woods

<P>before them should be slashed by the lines of

<P>flame.&nbsp; There was much growling and swearing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good Gawd," the youth grumbled, "we're

<P>always being chased around like rats!&nbsp; It makes

<P>me sick.&nbsp; Nobody seems to know where we go

<P>or why we go.&nbsp; We just get fired around from

<P>pillar to post and get licked here and get licked

<P>there, and nobody knows what it's done for.&nbsp; It

<P>makes a man feel like a damn' kitten in a bag.

<P>Now, I'd like to know what the eternal thunders

<P>we was marched into these woods for anyhow,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE 161
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>unless it was to give the rebs a regular pot shot

<P>at us.&nbsp; We came in here and got our legs all

<P>tangled up in these cussed briers, and then we

<P>begin to fight and the rebs had an easy time of it.

<P>Don't tell me it's just luck!&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; It's

<P>this derned old--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend seemed jaded, but he interrupted

<P>his comrade with a voice of calm confidence.

<P>"It'll turn out all right in th' end," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, the devil it will!&nbsp; You always talk like a

<P>dog-hanged parson.&nbsp; Don't tell me!&nbsp; I know--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this time there was an interposition by the

<P>savage-minded lieutenant, who was obliged to

<P>vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his

<P>men.&nbsp; "You boys shut right up!&nbsp; There no

<P>need 'a your wastin' your breath in long-winded

<P>arguments about this an' that an' th' other.

<P>You've been jawin' like a lot 'a old hens.&nbsp; All

<P>you've got t' do is to fight, an' you'll get plenty 'a

<P>that t' do in about ten minutes.&nbsp; Less talkin' an'

<P>more fightin' is what's best for you boys.&nbsp; I never

<P>saw sech gabbling jackasses."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused, ready to pounce upon any man

<P>who might have the temerity to reply.&nbsp; No words

<P>being said, he resumed his dignified pacing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There's too much chin music an' too little

<P>fightin' in this war, anyhow," he said to them,

<P>turning his head for a final remark.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The day had grown more white, until the sun

<P>shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest.

<P>A sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward

<P>that part of the line where lay the youth's regi-

<P>ment.&nbsp; The front shifted a trifle to meet it square-

<P>ly.&nbsp; There was a wait.&nbsp; In this part of the field

<P>there passed slowly the intense moments that pre-

<P>cede the tempest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A single rifle flashed in a thicket before the

<P>regiment.&nbsp; In an instant it was joined by many

<P>others.&nbsp; There was a mighty song of clashes and

<P>crashes that went sweeping through the woods.

<P>The guns in the rear, aroused and enraged by

<P>shells that had been thrown burlike at them,

<P>suddenly involved themselves in a hideous alter-

<P>cation with another band of guns.&nbsp; The battle

<P>roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a

<P>single, long explosion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the regiment there was a peculiar kind of

<P>hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men.

<P>They were worn, exhausted, having slept but lit-

<P>tle and labored much.&nbsp; They rolled their eyes

<P>toward the advancing battle as they stood await-

<P>ing the shock.&nbsp; Some shrank and flinched.&nbsp; They

<P>stood as men tied to stakes.
