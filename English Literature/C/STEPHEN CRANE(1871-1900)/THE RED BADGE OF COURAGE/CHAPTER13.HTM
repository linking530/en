<P>THE youth went slowly toward the fire in-

<P>dicated by his departed friend.&nbsp; As he reeled, he

<P>bethought him of the welcome his comrades

<P>would give him.&nbsp; He had a conviction that he

<P>would soon feel in his sore heart the barbed

<P>missiles of ridicule.&nbsp; He had no strength to in-

<P>vent a tale; he would be a soft target.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made vague plans to go off into the deeper

<P>darkness and hide, but they were all destroyed

<P>by the voices of exhaustion and pain from his

<P>body.&nbsp; His ailments, clamoring, forced him to

<P>seek the place of food and rest, at whatever cost.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He swung unsteadily toward the fire.&nbsp; He

<P>could see the forms of men throwing black

<P>shadows in the red light, and as he went nearer

<P>it became known to him in some way that the

<P>ground was strewn with sleeping men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of a sudden he confronted a black and

<P>monstrous figure.&nbsp; A rifle barrel caught some

<P>glinting beams.&nbsp; "Halt! halt!"&nbsp; He was dis-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>129

<P>mayed for a moment, but he presently thought

<P>that he recognized the nervous voice.&nbsp; As he

<P>stood tottering before the rifle barrel, he called

<P>out: "Why, hello, Wilson, you--you here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rifle was lowered to a position of caution

<P>and the loud soldier came slowly forward.&nbsp; He

<P>peered into the youth's face.&nbsp; "That you,

<P>Henry?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it's--it's me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, ol' boy," said the other, "by

<P>ginger, I'm glad t' see yeh!&nbsp; I give yeh up

<P>fer a goner.&nbsp; I thought yeh was dead sure

<P>enough."&nbsp; There was husky emotion in his

<P>voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth found that now he could barely

<P>stand upon his feet.&nbsp; There was a sudden sinking

<P>of his forces.&nbsp; He thought he must hasten to pro-

<P>duce his tale to protect him from the missiles

<P>already at the lips of his redoubtable comrades.

<P>So, staggering before the loud soldier, he began:

<P>"Yes, yes.&nbsp; I've--I've had an awful time.&nbsp; I've

<P>been all over.&nbsp; Way over on th' right.&nbsp; Ter'ble

<P>fightin' over there.&nbsp; I had an awful time.&nbsp; I got

<P>separated from th' reg'ment.&nbsp; Over on th' right,

<P>I got shot.&nbsp; In th' head.&nbsp; I never see sech

<P>fightin'.&nbsp; Awful time.&nbsp; I don't see how I could 'a

<P>got separated from th' reg'ment.&nbsp; I got shot,

<P>too."

<P>His friend had stepped forward quickly.

<P>"What?&nbsp; Got shot?&nbsp; Why didn't yeh say so

<P>first?&nbsp; Poor ol' boy, we must--hol' on a minnit;

<P>what am I doin'.&nbsp; I'll call Simpson."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another figure at that moment loomed in the

<P>gloom.&nbsp; They could see that it was the corporal.

<P>"Who yeh talkin' to, Wilson?" he demanded.

<P>His voice was anger-toned.&nbsp; "Who yeh talkin'

<P>to?&nbsp; Yeh th' derndest sentinel--why--hello,

<P>Henry, you here?&nbsp; Why, I thought you was

<P>dead four hours ago!&nbsp; Great Jerusalem, they

<P>keep turnin' up every ten minutes or so!&nbsp; We

<P>thought we'd lost forty-two men by straight

<P>count, but if they keep on a-comin' this way, we'll

<P>git th' comp'ny all back by mornin' yit.&nbsp; Where

<P>was yeh?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Over on th' right.&nbsp; I got separated"--began

<P>the youth with considerable glibness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his friend had interrupted hastily.&nbsp; "Yes,

<P>an' he got shot in th' head an' he's in a fix, an' we

<P>must see t' him right away."&nbsp; He rested his rifle

<P>in the hollow of his left arm and his right around

<P>the youth's shoulder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gee, it must hurt like thunder!" he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth leaned heavily upon his friend.

<P>"Yes, it hurts--hurts a good deal," he replied.

<P>There was a faltering in his voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh," said the corporal.&nbsp; He linked his arm

<P>in the youth's and drew him forward.&nbsp; "Come

<P>on, Henry.&nbsp; I'll take keer 'a yeh."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they went on together the loud private

<P>called out after them: "Put 'im t' sleep in my

<P>blanket, Simpson.&nbsp; An'--hol' on a minnit--here's

<P>my canteen.&nbsp; It's full 'a coffee.&nbsp; Look at his head

<P>by th' fire an' see how it looks.&nbsp; Maybe it's a

<P>pretty bad un.&nbsp; When I git relieved in a couple

<P>'a minnits, I'll be over an' see t' him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's senses were so deadened that his

<P>friend's voice sounded from afar and he could

<P>scarcely feel the pressure of the corporal's arm.

<P>He submitted passively to the latter's directing

<P>strength.&nbsp; His head was in the old manner hang-

<P>ing forward upon his breast.&nbsp; His knees wobbled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The corporal led him into the glare of the

<P>fire.&nbsp; "Now, Henry," he said, "let's have look at

<P>yer ol' head."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth sat down obediently and the cor-

<P>poral, laying aside his rifle, began to fumble in the

<P>bushy hair of his comrade.&nbsp; He was obliged to

<P>turn the other's head so that the full flush of the

<P>fire light would beam upon it.&nbsp; He puckered his

<P>mouth with a critical air.&nbsp; He drew back his lips

<P>and whistled through his teeth when his fingers

<P>came in contact with the splashed blood and the

<P>rare wound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, here we are!" he said.&nbsp; He awkwardly

<P>made further investigations.&nbsp; "Jest as I thought,"

<P>he added, presently.&nbsp; "Yeh've been grazed by a

<P>ball.&nbsp; It's raised a queer lump jest as if some

<P>feller had lammed yeh on th' head with a club.

<P>It stopped a-bleedin' long time ago.&nbsp; Th' most

<P>about it is that in th' mornin' yeh'll feel that a

<P>number ten hat wouldn't fit yeh.&nbsp; An' your

<P>head'll be all het up an' feel as dry as burnt pork.

<P>An' yeh may git a lot 'a other sicknesses, too, by

<P>mornin'.&nbsp; Yeh can't never tell.&nbsp; Still, I don't

<P>much think so.&nbsp; It's jest a damn' good belt on th'

<P>head, an' nothin' more.&nbsp; Now, you jest sit here

<P>an' don't move, while I go rout out th' relief.

<P>Then I'll send Wilson t' take keer 'a yeh."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The corporal went away.&nbsp; The youth re-

<P>mained on the ground like a parcel.&nbsp; He stared

<P>with a vacant look into the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time he aroused, for some part, and

<P>the things about him began to take form.&nbsp; He

<P>saw that the ground in the deep shadows was

<P>cluttered with men, sprawling in every con-

<P>ceivable posture.&nbsp; Glancing narrowly into the

<P>more distant darkness, he caught occasional

<P>glimpses of visages that loomed pallid and

<P>ghostly, lit with a phosphorescent glow.&nbsp; These

<P>faces expressed in their lines the deep stupor of

<P>the tired soldiers.&nbsp; They made them appear like

<P>men drunk with wine.&nbsp; This bit of forest might

<P>have appeared to an ethereal wanderer as a scene

<P>of the result of some frightful debauch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the other side of the fire the youth

<P>observed an officer asleep, seated bolt upright,

<P>with his back against a tree.&nbsp; There was some-

<P>thing perilous in his position.&nbsp; Badgered by

<P>dreams, perhaps, he swayed with little bounces

<P>and starts, like an old toddy-stricken grandfather

<P>in a chimney corner.&nbsp; Dust and stains were upon

<P>his face.&nbsp; His lower jaw hung down as if lacking

<P>strength to assume its normal position.&nbsp; He was

<P>the picture of an exhausted soldier after a feast of

<P>war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had evidently gone to sleep with his

<P>sword in his arms.&nbsp; These two had slumbered in

<P>an embrace, but the weapon had been allowed

<P>in time to fall unheeded to the ground.&nbsp; The

<P>brass-mounted hilt lay in contact with some parts

<P>of the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Within the gleam of rose and orange light

<P>from the burning sticks were other soldiers,

<P>snoring and heaving, or lying deathlike in

<P>slumber.&nbsp; A few pairs of legs were stuck forth,

<P>rigid and straight.&nbsp; The shoes displayed the mud

<P>or dust of marches and bits of rounded trousers,

<P>protruding from the blankets, showed rents and

<P>tears from hurried pitchings through the dense

<P>brambles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fire crackled musically.&nbsp; From it swelled

<P>light smoke.&nbsp; Overhead the foliage moved

<P>softly.&nbsp; The leaves, with their faces turned

<P>toward the blaze, were colored shifting hues of

<P>silver, often edged with red.&nbsp; Far off to the right,

<P>through a window in the forest could be seen a

<P>handful of stars lying, like glittering pebbles, on

<P>the black level of the night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Occasionally, in this low-arched hall, a soldier

<P>would arouse and turn his body to a new posi-

<P>tion, the experience of his sleep having taught

<P>him of uneven and objectionable places upon the

<P>ground under him.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, he would lift

<P>himself to a sitting posture, blink at the fire for

<P>an unintelligent moment, throw a swift glance at

<P>his prostrate companion, and then cuddle down

<P>again with a grunt of sleepy content.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth sat in a forlorn heap until his

<P>friend the loud young soldier came, swinging two

<P>canteens by their light strings.&nbsp; "Well, now,

<P>Henry, ol' boy," said the latter, "we'll have yeh

<P>fixed up in jest about a minnit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had the bustling ways of an amateur

<P>nurse.&nbsp; He fussed around the fire and stirred the

<P>sticks to brilliant exertions.&nbsp; He made his patient

<P>drink largely from the canteen that contained the

<P>coffee.&nbsp; It was to the youth a delicious draught.

<P>He tilted his head afar back and held the canteen

<P>long to his lips.&nbsp; The cool mixture went caress-

<P>ingly down his blistered throat.&nbsp; Having finished,

<P>he sighed with comfortable delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loud young soldier watched his comrade

<P>with an air of satisfaction.&nbsp; He later produced

<P>an extensive handkerchief from his pocket.&nbsp; He

<P>folded it into a manner of bandage and soused

<P>water from the other canteen upon the middle of

<P>it.&nbsp; This crude arrangement he bound over the

<P>youth's head, tying the ends in a queer knot at

<P>the back of the neck.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There," he said, moving off and surveying

<P>his deed, "yeh look like th' devil, but I bet yeh

<P>feel better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth contemplated his friend with grate-

<P>ful eyes.&nbsp; Upon his aching and swelling head the

<P>cold cloth was like a tender woman's hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh don't holler ner say nothin'," remarked

<P>his friend approvingly.&nbsp; "I know I'm a black-

<P>smith at takin' keer 'a sick folks, an' yeh never

<P>squeaked.&nbsp; Yer a good un, Henry.&nbsp; Most 'a men

<P>would a' been in th' hospital long ago.&nbsp; A shot in

<P>th' head ain't foolin' business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth made no reply, but began to fumble

<P>with the buttons of his jacket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, come, now," continued his friend,

<P>"come on.&nbsp; I must put yeh t' bed an' see that yeh

<P>git a good night's rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The other got carefully erect, and the loud

<P>young soldier led him among the sleeping forms

<P>lying in groups and rows.&nbsp; Presently he stooped

<P>and picked up his blankets.&nbsp; He spread the rubber

<P>one upon the ground and placed the woolen one

<P>about the youth's shoulders.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There now," he said, "lie down an' git some

<P>sleep."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, with his manner of doglike obe-

<P>dience, got carefully down like a crone stoop-

<P>ing.&nbsp; He stretched out with a murmur of relief

<P>and comfort.&nbsp; The ground felt like the softest

<P>couch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But of a sudden he ejaculated: "Hol' on a

<P>minnit!&nbsp; Where you goin' t' sleep?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend waved his hand impatiently.

<P>"Right down there by yeh."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, but hol' on a minnit," continued the

<P>youth.&nbsp; "What yeh goin' t' sleep in?&nbsp; I've got

<P>your--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loud young soldier snarled: "Shet up

<P>an' go on t' sleep.&nbsp; Don't be makin' a damn' fool

<P>'a yerself," he said severely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After the reproof the youth said no more.

<P>An exquisite drowsiness had spread through him.

<P>The warm comfort of the blanket enveloped him

<P>and made a gentle languor.&nbsp; His head fell for-

<P>ward on his crooked arm and his weighted lids

<P>went softly down over his eyes.&nbsp; Hearing a

<P>splatter of musketry from the distance, he

<P>wondered indifferently if those men sometimes

<P>slept.&nbsp; He gave a long sigh, snuggled down into

<P>his blanket, and in a moment was like his com-

<P>rades.
