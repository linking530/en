<BR>&nbsp;

<P>PRESENTLY they knew that no firing threat-

<P>ened them.&nbsp; All ways seemed once more opened

<P>to them.&nbsp; The dusty blue lines of their friends

<P>were disclosed a short distance away.&nbsp; In the

<P>distance there were many colossal noises, but in

<P>all this part of the field there was a sudden

<P>stillness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They perceived that they were free.&nbsp; The

<P>depleted band drew a long breath of relief

<P>and gathered itself into a bunch to complete

<P>its trip.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this last length of journey the men began

<P>to show strange emotions.&nbsp; They hurried with

<P>nervous fear.&nbsp; Some who had been dark and un-

<P>faltering in the grimmest moments now could not

<P>conceal an anxiety that made them frantic.&nbsp; It

<P>was perhaps that they dreaded to be killed in

<P>insignificant ways after the times for proper

<P>military deaths had passed.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, they

<P>thought it would be too ironical to get killed at
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>199

<P>the portals of safety.&nbsp; With backward looks of

<P>perturbation, they hastened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they approached their own lines there was

<P>some sarcasm exhibited on the part of a gaunt

<P>and bronzed regiment that lay resting in the

<P>shade of trees.&nbsp; Questions were wafted to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where th' hell yeh been?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What yeh comin' back fer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why didn't yeh stay there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Was it warm out there, sonny?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Goin' home now, boys?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One shouted in taunting mimicry: "Oh,

<P>mother, come quick an' look at th' sojers!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no reply from the bruised and bat-

<P>tered regiment, save that one man made broad-

<P>cast challenges to fist fights and the red-bearded

<P>officer walked rather near and glared in great

<P>swashbuckler style at a tall captain in the other

<P>regiment.&nbsp; But the lieutenant suppressed the

<P>man who wished to fist fight, and the tall cap-

<P>tain, flushing at the little fanfare of the red-

<P>bearded one, was obliged to look intently at some

<P>trees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's tender flesh was deeply stung by

<P>these remarks.&nbsp; From under his creased brows

<P>he glowered with hate at the mockers.&nbsp; He

<P>meditated upon a few revenges.&nbsp; Still, many in

<P>the regiment hung their heads in criminal fashion,

<P>so that it came to pass that the men trudged with

<P>sudden heaviness, as if they bore upon their

<P>bended shoulders the coffin of their honor.&nbsp; And

<P>the youthful lieutenant, recollecting himself, be-

<P>gan to mutter softly in black curses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They turned when they arrived at their old

<P>position to regard the ground over which they

<P>had charged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth in this contemplation was smitten

<P>with a large astonishment.&nbsp; He discovered that

<P>the distances, as compared with the brilliant

<P>measurings of his mind, were trivial and ridicu-

<P>lous.&nbsp; The stolid trees, where much had taken

<P>place, seemed incredibly near.&nbsp; The time, too,

<P>now that he reflected, he saw to have been short.

<P>He wondered at the number of emotions and

<P>events that had been crowded into such little

<P>spaces.&nbsp; Elfin thoughts must have exaggerated

<P>and enlarged everything, he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It seemed, then, that there was bitter justice

<P>in the speeches of the gaunt and bronzed vet-

<P>erans.&nbsp; He veiled a glance of disdain at his fel-

<P>lows who strewed the ground, choking with dust,

<P>red from perspiration, misty-eyed, disheveled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were gulping at their canteens, fierce to

<P>wring every mite of water from them, and they

<P>polished at their swollen and watery features

<P>with coat sleeves and bunches of grass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However, to the youth there was a consider-

<P>able joy in musing upon his performances during

<P>the charge.&nbsp; He had had very little time pre-

<P>viously in which to appreciate himself, so that

<P>there was now much satisfaction in quietly think-

<P>ing of his actions.&nbsp; He recalled bits of color that

<P>in the flurry had stamped themselves unawares

<P>upon his engaged senses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the regiment lay heaving from its hot exer-

<P>tions the officer who had named them as mule

<P>drivers came galloping along the line.&nbsp; He had

<P>lost his cap.&nbsp; His tousled hair streamed wildly,

<P>and his face was dark with vexation and wrath.

<P>His temper was displayed with more clearness

<P>by the way in which he managed his horse.&nbsp; He

<P>jerked and wrenched savagely at his bridle, stop-

<P>ping the hard-breathing animal with a furious

<P>pull near the colonel of the regiment.&nbsp; He im-

<P>mediately exploded in reproaches which came

<P>unbidden to the ears of the men.&nbsp; They were

<P>suddenly alert, being always curious about black

<P>words between officers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, thunder, MacChesnay, what an awful

<P>bull you made of this thing!" began the officer.

<P>He attempted low tones, but his indignation

<P>caused certain of the men to learn the sense of

<P>his words.&nbsp; "What an awful mess you made!

<P>Good Lord, man, you stopped about a hun-

<P>dred feet this side of a very pretty success!&nbsp; If

<P>your men had gone a hundred feet farther you

<P>would have made a great charge, but as it is

<P>--what a lot of mud diggers you've got any-

<P>way!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men, listening with bated breath, now

<P>turned their curious eyes upon the colonel.

<P>They had a ragamuffin interest in this affair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The colonel was seen to straighten his form

<P>and put one hand forth in oratorical fashion.

<P>He wore an injured air; it was as if a deacon

<P>had been accused of stealing.&nbsp; The men were

<P>wiggling in an ecstasy of excitement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But of a sudden the colonel's manner changed

<P>from that of a deacon to that of a Frenchman.

<P>He shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "Oh, well, general,

<P>we went as far as we could," he said calmly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As far as you could?&nbsp; Did you, b'Gawd?"

<P>snorted the other.&nbsp; "Well, that wasn't very far,

<P>was it?" he added, with a glance of cold con-

<P>tempt into the other's eyes.&nbsp; "Not very far, I

<P>think.&nbsp; You were intended to make a diversion

<P>in favor of Whiterside.&nbsp; How well you succeeded

<P>your own ears can now tell you."&nbsp; He wheeled

<P>his horse and rode stiffly away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The colonel, bidden to hear the jarring noises

<P>of an engagement in the woods to the left, broke

<P>out in vague damnations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant, who had listened with an air

<P>of impotent rage to the interview, spoke suddenly

<P>in firm and undaunted tones.&nbsp; "I don't care what

<P>a man is--whether he is a general or what--if

<P>he says th' boys didn't put up a good fight out

<P>there he's a damned fool."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lieutenant," began the colonel, severely,

<P>"this is my own affair, and I'll trouble you--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant made an obedient gesture.

<P>"All right, colonel, all right," he said.&nbsp; He sat

<P>down with an air of being content with him-

<P>self.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The news that the regiment had been re-

<P>proached went along the line.&nbsp; For a time the

<P>men were bewildered by it.&nbsp; "Good thunder!"

<P>they ejaculated, staring at the vanishing form of

<P>the general.&nbsp; They conceived it to be a huge

<P>mistake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently, however, they began to believe that

<P>in truth their efforts had been called light.&nbsp; The

<P>youth could see this conviction weigh upon the

<P>entire regiment until the men were like cuffed

<P>and cursed animals, but withal rebellious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend, with a grievance in his eye,

<P>went to the youth.&nbsp; "I wonder what he does

<P>want," he said.&nbsp; "He must think we went out

<P>there an' played marbles!&nbsp; I never see sech a

<P>man!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth developed a tranquil philosophy

<P>for these moments of irritation.&nbsp; "Oh, well," he

<P>rejoined, "he probably didn't see nothing of it at

<P>all and got mad as blazes, and concluded we were

<P>a lot of sheep, just because we didn't do what he

<P>wanted done.&nbsp; It's a pity old Grandpa Hender-

<P>son got killed yestirday--he'd have known that

<P>we did our best and fought good.&nbsp; It's just our

<P>awful luck, that's what."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should say so," replied the friend.&nbsp; He

<P>seemed to be deeply wounded at an injustice.

<P>"I should say we did have awful luck!&nbsp; There's

<P>no fun in fightin' fer people when everything

<P>yeh do--no matter what--ain't done right.&nbsp; I

<P>have a notion t' stay behind next time an' let

<P>'em take their ol' charge an' go t' th' devil

<P>with it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth spoke soothingly to his comrade.

<P>"Well, we both did good.&nbsp; I'd like to see the

<P>fool what'd say we both didn't do as good as we

<P>could!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course we did," declared the friend

<P>stoutly.&nbsp; "An' I'd break th' feller's neck if he was

<P>as big as a church.&nbsp; But we're all right, anyhow,

<P>for I heard one feller say that we two fit th' best

<P>in th' reg'ment, an' they had a great argument

<P>'bout it.&nbsp; Another feller, 'a course, he had t' up

<P>an' say it was a lie--he seen all what was goin'

<P>on an' he never seen us from th' beginnin' t' th'

<P>end.&nbsp; An' a lot more struck in an' ses it wasn't

<P>a lie--we did fight like thunder, an' they give

<P>us quite a send-off.&nbsp; But this is what I can't

<P>stand--these everlastin' ol' soldiers, titterin' an'

<P>laughin', an' then that general, he's crazy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth exclaimed with sudden exaspera-

<P>tion: "He's a lunkhead!&nbsp; He makes me mad.

<P>I wish he'd come along next time.&nbsp; We'd show

<P>'im what--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ceased because several men had come

<P>hurrying up.&nbsp; Their faces expressed a bringing

<P>of great news.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"O Flem, yeh jest oughta heard!" cried one,

<P>eagerly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Heard what?" said the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh jest oughta heard!" repeated the other,

<P>and he arranged himself to tell his tidings.&nbsp; The

<P>others made an excited circle.&nbsp; "Well, sir, th'

<P>colonel met your lieutenant right by us--it was

<P>damnedest thing I ever heard--an' he ses: 'Ahem!

<P>ahem!' he ses.&nbsp; 'Mr. Hasbrouck!' he ses, 'by

<P>th' way, who was that lad what carried th' flag?'

<P>he ses.&nbsp; There, Flemin', what d' yeh think 'a

<P>that?&nbsp; 'Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?'

<P>he ses, an' th' lieutenant, he speaks up right

<P>away: 'That's Flemin', an' he's a jimhickey,' he

<P>ses, right away.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I say he did.&nbsp; 'A jim-

<P>hickey,' he ses--those 'r his words.&nbsp; He did, too.

<P>I say he did.&nbsp; If you kin tell this story better

<P>than I kin, go ahead an' tell it.&nbsp; Well, then, keep

<P>yer mouth shet.&nbsp; Th' lieutenant, he ses: 'He's a

<P>jimhickey,' an' th' colonel, he ses: 'Ahem! ahem!

<P>he is, indeed, a very good man t' have, ahem!&nbsp; He

<P>kep' th' flag 'way t' th' front.&nbsp; I saw 'im.&nbsp; He's a

<P>good un,' ses th' colonel.&nbsp; 'You bet,' ses th' lieu-

<P>tenant, 'he an' a feller named Wilson was at th'

<P>head 'a th' charge, an' howlin' like Indians all th'

<P>time,' he ses.&nbsp; 'Head 'a th' charge all th' time,'

<P>he ses.&nbsp; 'A feller named Wilson,' he ses.&nbsp; There,

<P>Wilson, m'boy, put that in a letter an' send it

<P>hum t' yer mother, hay?&nbsp; 'A feller named Wil-

<P>son,' he ses.&nbsp; An' th' colonel, he ses: 'Were they,

<P>indeed?&nbsp; Ahem! ahem!&nbsp; My sakes!' he ses.&nbsp; 'At

<P>th' head 'a th' reg'ment?' he ses.&nbsp; 'They were,'

<P>ses th' lieutenant.&nbsp; 'My sakes!' ses th' colonel.

<P>He ses: 'Well, well, well,' he ses, 'those two

<P>babies?'&nbsp; 'They were,' ses th' lieutenant.

<P>'Well, well,' ses th' colonel, 'they deserve t' be

<P>major generals,' he ses.&nbsp; 'They deserve t' be

<P>major-generals.'
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth and his friend had said: "Huh!"

<P>"Yer lyin', Thompson."&nbsp; "Oh, go t' blazes!"

<P>"He never sed it."&nbsp; "Oh, what a lie!"&nbsp; "Huh!"

<P>But despite these youthful scoffings and embar-

<P>rassments, they knew that their faces were deeply

<P>flushing from thrills of pleasure.&nbsp; They ex-

<P>changed a secret glance of joy and congratula-

<P>tion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They speedily forgot many things.&nbsp; The past

<P>held no pictures of error and disappointment.

<P>They were very happy, and their hearts swelled

<P>with grateful affection for the colonel and the

<P>youthful lieutenant.
