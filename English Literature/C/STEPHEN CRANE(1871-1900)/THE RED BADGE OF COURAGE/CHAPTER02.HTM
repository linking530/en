<P>THE next morning the youth discovered that

<P>his tall comrade had been the fast-flying messen-

<P>ger of a mistake.&nbsp; There was much scoffing at

<P>the latter by those who had yesterday been firm

<P>adherents of his views, and there was even a lit-

<P>tle sneering by men who had never believed the

<P>rumor.&nbsp; The tall one fought with a man from

<P>Chatfield Corners and beat him severely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth felt, however, that his problem was

<P>in no wise lifted from him.&nbsp; There was, on the

<P>contrary, an irritating prolongation.&nbsp; The tale

<P>had created in him a great concern for himself.

<P>Now, with the newborn question in his mind, he

<P>was compelled to sink back into his old place as

<P>part of a blue demonstration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For days he made ceaseless calculations, but

<P>they were all wondrously unsatisfactory.&nbsp; He

<P>found that he could establish nothing.&nbsp; He final-

<P>ly concluded that the only way to prove himself

<P>was to go into the blaze, and then figuratively to
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>18

<P>watch his legs to discover their merits and faults.

<P>He reluctantly admitted that he could not sit

<P>still and with a mental slate and pencil derive an

<P>answer.&nbsp; To gain it, he must have blaze, blood,

<P>and danger, even as a chemist requires this, that,

<P>and the other.&nbsp; So he fretted for an opportunity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Meanwhile he continually tried to measure

<P>himself by his comrades.&nbsp; The tall soldier, for

<P>one, gave him some assurance.&nbsp; This man's se-

<P>rene unconcern dealt him a measure of con-

<P>fidence, for he had known him since childhood,

<P>and from his intimate knowledge he did not see

<P>how he could be capable of anything that was

<P>beyond him, the youth.&nbsp; Still, he thought that

<P>his comrade might be mistaken about himself.

<P>Or, on the other hand, he might be a man here-

<P>tofore doomed to peace and obscurity, but, in

<P>reality, made to shine in war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth would have liked to have discov-

<P>ered another who suspected himself.&nbsp; A sympa-

<P>thetic comparison of mental notes would have

<P>been a joy to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He occasionally tried to fathom a comrade

<P>with seductive sentences.&nbsp; He looked about to

<P>find men in the proper mood.&nbsp; All attempts

<P>failed to bring forth any statement which looked

<P>in any way like a confession to those doubts

<P>which he privately acknowledged in himself.

<P>He was afraid to make an open declaration of

<P>his concern, because he dreaded to place some

<P>unscrupulous confidant upon the high plane of

<P>the unconfessed from which elevation he could

<P>be derided.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In regard to his companions his mind wa-

<P>vered between two opinions, according to his

<P>mood.&nbsp; Sometimes he inclined to believing them

<P>all heroes.&nbsp; In fact, he usually admitted in secret

<P>the superior development of the higher qualities

<P>in others.&nbsp; He could conceive of men going very

<P>insignificantly about the world bearing a load of

<P>courage unseen, and although he had known

<P>many of his comrades through boyhood, he be-

<P>gan to fear that his judgment of them had been

<P>blind.&nbsp; Then, in other moments, he flouted these

<P>theories, and assured himself that his fellows

<P>were all privately wondering and quaking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His emotions made him feel strange in the

<P>presence of men who talked excitedly of a pro-

<P>spective battle as of a drama they were about to

<P>witness, with nothing but eagerness and curiosity

<P>apparent in their faces.&nbsp; It was often that he sus-

<P>pected them to be liars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not pass such thoughts without severe

<P>condemnation of himself.&nbsp; He dinned reproaches

<P>at times.&nbsp; He was convicted by himself of many

<P>shameful crimes against the gods of traditions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In his great anxiety his heart was continually

<P>clamoring at what he considered the intolerable

<P>slowness of the generals.&nbsp; They seemed content

<P>to perch tranquilly on the river bank, and leave

<P>him bowed down by the weight of a great prob-

<P>lem.&nbsp; He wanted it settled forthwith.&nbsp; He could

<P>not long bear such a load, he said.&nbsp; Sometimes

<P>his anger at the commanders reached an acute

<P>stage, and he grumbled about the camp like a

<P>veteran.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One morning, however, he found himself in

<P>the ranks of his prepared regiment.&nbsp; The men

<P>were whispering speculations and recounting the

<P>old rumors.&nbsp; In the gloom before the break of

<P>the day their uniforms glowed a deep purple

<P>hue.&nbsp; From across the river the red eyes were

<P>still peering.&nbsp; In the eastern sky there was a yel-

<P>low patch like a rug laid for the feet of the com-

<P>ing sun; and against it, black and patternlike,

<P>loomed the gigantic figure of the colonel on a

<P>gigantic horse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From off in the darkness came the trampling

<P>of feet.&nbsp; The youth could occasionally see dark

<P>shadows that moved like monsters.&nbsp; The regi-

<P>ment stood at rest for what seemed a long time.

<P>The youth grew impatient.&nbsp; It was unendurable

<P>the way these affairs were managed.&nbsp; He won-

<P>dered how long they were to be kept waiting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he looked all about him and pondered

<P>upon the mystic gloom, he began to believe that

<P>at any moment the ominous distance might be

<P>aflare, and the rolling crashes of an engagement

<P>come to his ears.&nbsp; Staring once at the red eyes

<P>across the river, he conceived them to be grow-

<P>ing larger, as the orbs of a row of dragons ad-

<P>vancing.&nbsp; He turned toward the colonel and saw

<P>him lift his gigantic arm and calmly stroke his

<P>mustache.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last he heard from along the road at the

<P>foot of the hill the clatter of a horse's galloping

<P>hoofs.&nbsp; It must be the coming of orders.&nbsp; He

<P>bent forward, scarce breathing.&nbsp; The exciting

<P>clickety-click, as it grew louder and louder,

<P>seemed to be beating upon his soul.&nbsp; Presently a

<P>horseman with jangling equipment drew rein be-

<P>fore the colonel of the regiment.&nbsp; The two held

<P>a short, sharp-worded conversation.&nbsp; The men in

<P>the foremost ranks craned their necks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the horseman wheeled his animal and gal-

<P>loped away he turned to shout over his shoulder,

<P>"Don't forget that box of cigars!"&nbsp; The colonel

<P>mumbled in reply.&nbsp; The youth wondered what a

<P>box of cigars had to do with war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A moment later the regiment went swinging

<P>off into the darkness.&nbsp; It was now like one of

<P>those moving monsters wending with many feet.

<P>The air was heavy, and cold with dew.&nbsp; A mass

<P>of wet grass, marched upon, rustled like silk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was an occasional flash and glimmer

<P>of steel from the backs of all these huge crawl-

<P>ing reptiles.&nbsp; From the road came creakings and

<P>grumblings as some surly guns were dragged

<P>away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men stumbled along still muttering specu-

<P>lations.&nbsp; There was a subdued debate.&nbsp; Once a

<P>man fell down, and as he reached for his rifle a

<P>comrade, unseeing, trod upon his hand.&nbsp; He of

<P>the injured fingers swore bitterly and aloud.&nbsp; A

<P>low, tittering laugh went among his fellows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently they passed into a roadway and

<P>marched forward with easy strides.&nbsp; A dark

<P>regiment moved before them, and from behind

<P>also came the tinkle of equipments on the bodies

<P>of marching men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The rushing yellow of the developing day

<P>went on behind their backs.&nbsp; When the sunrays

<P>at last struck full and mellowingly upon the

<P>earth, the youth saw that the landscape was

<P>streaked with two long, thin, black columns

<P>which disappeared on the brow of a hill in front

<P>and rearward vanished in a wood.&nbsp; They were

<P>like two serpents crawling from the cavern of the

<P>night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The river was not in view.&nbsp; The tall soldier

<P>burst into praises of what he thought to be his

<P>powers of perception.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some of the tall one's companions cried with

<P>emphasis that they, too, had evolved the same

<P>thing, and they congratulated themselves upon

<P>it.&nbsp; But there were others who said that the tall

<P>one's plan was not the true one at all.&nbsp; They per-

<P>sisted with other theories.&nbsp; There was a vigorous

<P>discussion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth took no part in them.&nbsp; As he

<P>walked along in careless line he was engaged

<P>with his own eternal debate.&nbsp; He could not hin-

<P>der himself from dwelling upon it.&nbsp; He was de-

<P>spondent and sullen, and threw shifting glances

<P>about him.&nbsp; He looked ahead, often expecting to

<P>hear from the advance the rattle of firing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the long serpents crawled slowly from

<P>hill to hill without bluster of smoke.&nbsp; A dun-col-

<P>ored cloud of dust floated away to the right.

<P>The sky overhead was of a fairy blue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth studied the faces of his compan-

<P>ions, ever on the watch to detect kindred emo-

<P>tions.&nbsp; He suffered disappointment.&nbsp; Some ardor

<P>of the air which was causing the veteran com-

<P>mands to move with glee--almost with song--

<P>had infected the new regiment.&nbsp; The men began

<P>to speak of victory as of a thing they knew.

<P>Also, the tall soldier received his vindication.

<P>They were certainly going to come around in

<P>behind the enemy.&nbsp; They expressed commisera-

<P>tion for that part of the army which had been

<P>left upon the river bank, felicitating themselves

<P>upon being a part of a blasting host.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, considering himself as separated

<P>from the others, was saddened by the blithe and

<P>merry speeches that went from rank to rank.

<P>The company wags all made their best endeav-

<P>ors.&nbsp; The regiment tramped to the tune of

<P>laughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blatant soldier often convulsed whole

<P>files by his biting sarcasms aimed at the tall one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And it was not long before all the men seemed

<P>to forget their mission.&nbsp; Whole brigades grinned

<P>in unison, and regiments laughed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse

<P>from a dooryard.&nbsp; He planned to load his knap-

<P>sack upon it.&nbsp; He was escaping with his prize

<P>when a young girl rushed from the house and

<P>grabbed the animal's mane.&nbsp; There followed a

<P>wrangle.&nbsp; The young girl, with pink cheeks and

<P>shining eyes, stood like a dauntless statue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The observant regiment, standing at rest in

<P>the roadway, whooped at once, and entered

<P>whole-souled upon the side of the maiden.&nbsp; The

<P>men became so engrossed in this affair that they

<P>entirely ceased to remember their own large war.

<P>They jeered the piratical private, and called

<P>attention to various defects in his personal ap-

<P>pearance; and they were wildly enthusiastic in

<P>support of the young girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To her, from some distance, came bold advice.

<P>"Hit him with a stick."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were crows and catcalls showered

<P>upon him when he retreated without the horse.

<P>The regiment rejoiced at his downfall.&nbsp; Loud

<P>and vociferous congratulations were showered

<P>upon the maiden, who stood panting and regard-

<P>ing the troops with defiance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At nightfall the column broke into regimental

<P>pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to

<P>camp.&nbsp; Tents sprang up like strange plants.

<P>Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted

<P>the night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth kept from intercourse with his

<P>companions as much as circumstances would

<P>allow him.&nbsp; In the evening he wandered a few

<P>paces into the gloom.&nbsp; From this little distance

<P>the many fires, with the black forms of men pass-

<P>ing to and fro before the crimson rays, made

<P>weird and satanic effects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He lay down in the grass.&nbsp; The blades

<P>pressed tenderly against his cheek.&nbsp; The moon

<P>had been lighted and was hung in a treetop.

<P>The liquid stillness of the night enveloping him

<P>made him feel vast pity for himself.&nbsp; There was

<P>a caress in the soft winds; and the whole mood

<P>of the darkness, he thought, was one of sympathy

<P>for himself in his distress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He wished, without reserve, that he was at

<P>home again making the endless rounds from the

<P>house to the barn, from the barn to the fields,

<P>from the fields to the barn, from the barn to the

<P>house.&nbsp; He remembered he had often cursed the

<P>brindle cow and her mates, and had sometimes

<P>flung milking stools.&nbsp; But, from his present point

<P>of view, there was a halo of happiness about each

<P>of their heads, and he would have sacrificed all

<P>the brass buttons on the continent to have been

<P>enabled to return to them.&nbsp; He told himself that

<P>he was not formed for a soldier.&nbsp; And he mused

<P>seriously upon the radical differences between

<P>himself and those men who were dodging imp-

<P>like around the fires.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass,

<P>and, upon turning his head, discovered the loud

<P>soldier.&nbsp; He called out, "Oh, Wilson!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The latter approached and looked down.

<P>"Why, hello, Henry; is it you?&nbsp; What you do-

<P>ing here?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, thinking," said the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The other sat down and carefully lighted his

<P>pipe.&nbsp; "You're getting blue, my boy.&nbsp; You're

<P>looking thundering peeked.&nbsp; What the dickens

<P>is wrong with you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, nothing," said the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loud soldier launched then into the sub-

<P>ject of the anticipated fight.&nbsp; "Oh, we've got

<P>'em now!"&nbsp; As he spoke his boyish face was

<P>wreathed in a gleeful smile, and his voice had

<P>an exultant ring.&nbsp; "We've got 'em now.&nbsp; At

<P>last, by the eternal thunders, we'll lick 'em

<P>good!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If the truth was known," he added, more

<P>soberly, "THEY'VE licked US about every clip up to

<P>now; but this time--this time--we'll lick 'em

<P>good!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you was objecting to this march

<P>a little while ago," said the youth coldly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, it wasn't that," explained the other.&nbsp; "I

<P>don't mind marching, if there's going to be fight-

<P>ing at the end of it.&nbsp; What I hate is this getting

<P>moved here and moved there, with no good com-

<P>ing of it, as far as I can see, excepting sore feet

<P>and damned short rations."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Jim Conklin says we'll get a plenty of

<P>fighting this time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's right for once, I guess, though I can't

<P>see how it come.&nbsp; This time we're in for a big

<P>battle, and we've got the best end of it, certain

<P>sure.&nbsp; Gee rod! how we will thump 'em!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He arose and began to pace to and fro excit-

<P>edly.&nbsp; The thrill of his enthusiasm made him

<P>walk with an elastic step.&nbsp; He was sprightly,

<P>vigorous, fiery in his belief in success.&nbsp; He

<P>looked into the future with clear, proud eye, and

<P>he swore with the air of an old soldier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth watched him for a moment in

<P>silence.&nbsp; When he finally spoke his voice was as

<P>bitter as dregs.&nbsp; "Oh, you're going to do great

<P>things, I s'pose!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of

<P>smoke from his pipe.&nbsp; "Oh, I don't know," he

<P>remarked with dignity; "I don't know.&nbsp; I s'pose

<P>I'll do as well as the rest.&nbsp; I'm going to try like

<P>thunder."&nbsp; He evidently complimented himself

<P>upon the modesty of this statement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you know you won't run when the

<P>time comes?" asked the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Run?" said the loud one; "run?--of course

<P>not!"&nbsp; He laughed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," continued the youth, "lots of good-

<P>a-'nough men have thought they was going to do

<P>great things before the fight, but when the time

<P>come they skedaddled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, that's all true, I s'pose," replied the

<P>other; "but I'm not going to skedaddle.&nbsp; The

<P>man that bets on my running will lose his money,

<P>that's all."&nbsp; He nodded confidently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, shucks!" said the youth.&nbsp; "You ain't

<P>the bravest man in the world, are you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I ain't," exclaimed the loud soldier in-

<P>dignantly; "and I didn't say I was the bravest

<P>man in the world, neither.&nbsp; I said I was going to

<P>do my share of fighting--that's what I said.&nbsp; And

<P>I am, too.&nbsp; Who are you, anyhow.&nbsp; You talk as

<P>if you thought you was Napoleon Bonaparte."

<P>He glared at the youth for a moment, and then

<P>strode away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth called in a savage voice after his

<P>comrade: "Well, you needn't git mad about it!"

<P>But the other continued on his way and made no

<P>reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He felt alone in space when his injured com-

<P>rade had disappeared.&nbsp; His failure to discover

<P>any mite of resemblance in their view points

<P>made him more miserable than before.&nbsp; No one

<P>seemed to be wrestling with such a terrific per-

<P>sonal problem.&nbsp; He was a mental outcast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went slowly to his tent and stretched him-

<P>self on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall

<P>soldier.&nbsp; In the darkness he saw visions of a thou-

<P>sand-tongued fear that would babble at his back

<P>and cause him to flee, while others were going

<P>coolly about their country's business.&nbsp; He admit-

<P>ted that he would not be able to cope with this

<P>monster.&nbsp; He felt that every nerve in his body

<P>would be an ear to hear the voices, while other

<P>men would remain stolid and deaf.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And as he sweated with the pain of these

<P>thoughts, he could hear low, serene sentences.

<P>"I'll bid five."&nbsp; "Make it six."&nbsp; "Seven."

<P>"Seven goes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stared at the red, shivering reflection of

<P>a fire on the white wall of his tent until, ex-

<P>hausted and ill from the monotony of his suf-

<P>fering, he fell asleep.
