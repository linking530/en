<P>THERE were moments of waiting.&nbsp; The youth

<P>thought of the village street at home before the

<P>arrival of the circus parade on a day in the

<P>spring.&nbsp; He remembered how he had stood, a

<P>small, thrillful boy, prepared to follow the dingy

<P>lady upon the white horse, or the band in its

<P>faded chariot.&nbsp; He saw the yellow road, the

<P>lines of expectant people, and the sober houses.

<P>He particularly remembered an old fellow who

<P>used to sit upon a cracker box in front of the

<P>store and feign to despise such exhibitions.&nbsp; A

<P>thousand details of color and form surged in his

<P>mind.&nbsp; The old fellow upon the cracker box ap-

<P>peared in middle prominence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some one cried, "Here they come!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was rustling and muttering among the

<P>men.&nbsp; They displayed a feverish desire to have

<P>every possible cartridge ready to their hands.

<P>The boxes were pulled around into various posi-

<P>tions, and adjusted with great care.&nbsp; It was as if

<P>seven hundred new bonnets were being tried on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier, having prepared his rifle, pro-

<P>duced a red handkerchief of some kind.&nbsp; He was

<P>engaged in knitting it about his throat with ex-

<P>quisite attention to its position, when the cry was

<P>repeated up and down the line in a muffled roar

<P>of sound.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here they come!&nbsp; Here they come!"&nbsp; Gun

<P>locks clicked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown

<P>swarm of running men who were giving shrill

<P>yells.&nbsp; They came on, stooping and swinging

<P>their rifles at all angles.&nbsp; A flag, tilted forward,

<P>sped near the front.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he caught sight of them the youth was

<P>momentarily startled by a thought that perhaps

<P>his gun was not loaded.&nbsp; He stood trying to

<P>rally his faltering intellect so that he might rec-

<P>ollect the moment when he had loaded, but he

<P>could not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A hatless general pulled his dripping horse to

<P>a stand near the colonel of the 304th.&nbsp; He shook

<P>his fist in the other's face.&nbsp; "You 've got to hold

<P>'em back!" he shouted, savagely; "you 've got

<P>to hold 'em back!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In his agitation the colonel began to stammer.

<P>"A-all r-right, General, all right, by Gawd!&nbsp; We-

<P>we'll do our--we-we'll d-d-do--do our best, Gen-

<P>eral."&nbsp; The general made a passionate gesture

<P>and galloped away.&nbsp; The colonel, perchance to

<P>relieve his feelings, began to scold like a wet

<P>parrot.&nbsp; The youth, turning swiftly to make

<P>sure that the rear was unmolested, saw the com-

<P>mander regarding his men in a highly regretful

<P>manner, as if he regretted above everything his

<P>association with them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man at the youth's elbow was mumbling,

<P>as if to himself: "Oh, we 're in for it now! oh,

<P>we 're in for it now!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The captain of the company had been pacing

<P>excitedly to and fro in the rear.&nbsp; He coaxed in

<P>schoolmistress fashion, as to a congregation of

<P>boys with primers.&nbsp; His talk was an endless

<P>repetition.&nbsp; "Reserve your fire, boys--don't

<P>shoot till I tell you--save your fire--wait till

<P>they get close up--don't be damned fools--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Perspiration streamed down the youth's face,

<P>which was soiled like that of a weeping urchin.

<P>He frequently, with a nervous movement, wiped

<P>his eyes with his coat sleeve.&nbsp; His mouth was

<P>still a little ways open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He got the one glance at the foe-swarming

<P>field in front of him, and instantly ceased to de-

<P>bate the question of his piece being loaded.&nbsp; Be-

<P>fore he was ready to begin--before he had an-

<P>nounced to himself that he was about to fight--

<P>he threw the obedient, well-balanced rifle into

<P>position and fired a first wild shot.&nbsp; Directly he

<P>was working at his weapon like an automatic

<P>affair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He suddenly lost concern for himself, and for-

<P>got to look at a menacing fate.&nbsp; He became not a

<P>man but a member.&nbsp; He felt that something of

<P>which he was a part--a regiment, an army, a

<P>cause, or a country--was in a crisis.&nbsp; He was

<P>welded into a common personality which was

<P>dominated by a single desire.&nbsp; For some mo-

<P>ments he could not flee no more than a little

<P>finger can commit a revolution from a hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If he had thought the regiment was about to

<P>be annihilated perhaps he could have amputated

<P>himself from it.&nbsp; But its noise gave him assur-

<P>ance.&nbsp; The regiment was like a firework that,

<P>once ignited, proceeds superior to circumstances

<P>until its blazing vitality fades.&nbsp; It wheezed and

<P>banged with a mighty power.&nbsp; He pictured the

<P>ground before it as strewn with the discom-

<P>fited.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a consciousness always of the pres-

<P>ence of his comrades about him.&nbsp; He felt the

<P>subtle battle brotherhood more potent even than

<P>the cause for which they were fighting.&nbsp; It was a

<P>mysterious fraternity born of the smoke and dan-

<P>ger of death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was at a task.&nbsp; He was like a carpenter

<P>who has made many boxes, making still another

<P>box, only there was furious haste in his move-

<P>ments.&nbsp; He, in his thought, was careering off in

<P>other places, even as the carpenter who as he

<P>works whistles and thinks of his friend or his

<P>enemy, his home or a saloon.&nbsp; And these jolted

<P>dreams were never perfect to him afterward, but

<P>remained a mass of blurred shapes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently he began to feel the effects of the

<P>war atmosphere--a blistering sweat, a sensation

<P>that his eyeballs were about to crack like hot

<P>stones.&nbsp; A burning roar filled his ears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Following this came a red rage.&nbsp; He devel-

<P>oped the acute exasperation of a pestered animal,

<P>a well-meaning cow worried by dogs.&nbsp; He had a

<P>mad feeling against his rifle, which could only be

<P>used against one life at a time.&nbsp; He wished to

<P>rush forward and strangle with his fingers.&nbsp; He

<P>craved a power that would enable him to make a

<P>world-sweeping gesture and brush all back.&nbsp; His

<P>impotency appeared to him, and made his rage

<P>into that of a driven beast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Buried in the smoke of many rifles his anger

<P>was directed not so much against the men whom

<P>he knew were rushing toward him as against the

<P>swirling battle phantoms which were choking

<P>him, stuffing their smoke robes down his parched

<P>throat.&nbsp; He fought frantically for respite for his

<P>senses, for air, as a babe being smothered attacks

<P>the deadly blankets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a blare of heated rage mingled with

<P>a certain expression of intentness on all faces.

<P>Many of the men were making low-toned noises

<P>with their mouths, and these subdued cheers,

<P>snarls, imprecations, prayers, made a wild, bar-

<P>baric song that went as an undercurrent of sound,

<P>strange and chantlike with the resounding chords

<P>of the war march.&nbsp; The man at the youth's elbow

<P>was babbling.&nbsp; In it there was something soft and

<P>tender like the monologue of a babe.&nbsp; The tall

<P>soldier was swearing in a loud voice.&nbsp; From his

<P>lips came a black procession of curious oaths.&nbsp; Of

<P>a sudden another broke out in a querulous way

<P>like a man who has mislaid his hat.&nbsp; "Well, why

<P>don't they support us?&nbsp; Why don't they send

<P>supports?&nbsp; Do they think--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth in his battle sleep heard this as one

<P>who dozes hears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a singular absence of heroic poses.

<P>The men bending and surging in their haste and

<P>rage were in every impossible attitude.&nbsp; The steel

<P>ramrods clanked and clanged with incessant din

<P>as the men pounded them furiously into the hot

<P>rifle barrels.&nbsp; The flaps of the cartridge boxes were

<P>all unfastened, and bobbed idiotically with each

<P>movement.&nbsp; The rifles, once loaded, were jerked

<P>to the shoulder and fired without apparent aim

<P>into the smoke or at one of the blurred and shift-

<P>ing forms which upon the field before the regi-

<P>ment had been growing larger and larger like

<P>puppets under a magician's hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The officers, at their intervals, rearward, neg-

<P>lected to stand in picturesque attitudes.&nbsp; They

<P>were bobbing to and fro roaring directions and

<P>encouragements.&nbsp; The dimensions of their howls

<P>were extraordinary.&nbsp; They expended their lungs

<P>with prodigal wills.&nbsp; And often they nearly stood

<P>upon their heads in their anxiety to observe the

<P>enemy on the other side of the tumbling smoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant of the youth's company had en-

<P>countered a soldier who had fled screaming at

<P>the first volley of his comrades.&nbsp; Behind the lines

<P>these two were acting a little isolated scene.&nbsp; The

<P>man was blubbering and staring with sheeplike

<P>eyes at the lieutenant, who had seized him by the

<P>collar and was pommeling him.&nbsp; He drove him

<P>back into the ranks with many blows.&nbsp; The sol-

<P>dier went mechanically, dully, with his animal-

<P>like eyes upon the officer.&nbsp; Perhaps there was to

<P>him a divinity expressed in the voice of the other

<P>--stern, hard, with no reflection of fear in it.&nbsp; He

<P>tried to reload his gun, but his shaking hands pre-

<P>vented.&nbsp; The lieutenant was obliged to assist him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men dropped here and there like bundles.

<P>The captain of the youth's company had been

<P>killed in an early part of the action.&nbsp; His body

<P>lay stretched out in the position of a tired man

<P>resting, but upon his face there was an astonished

<P>and sorrowful look, as if he thought some friend

<P>had done him an ill turn.&nbsp; The babbling man was

<P>grazed by a shot that made the blood stream

<P>widely down his face.&nbsp; He clapped both hands

<P>to his head.&nbsp; "Oh!" he said, and ran.&nbsp; Another

<P>grunted suddenly as if he had been struck by a

<P>club in the stomach.&nbsp; He sat down and gazed

<P>ruefully.&nbsp; In his eyes there was mute, indefinite

<P>reproach.&nbsp; Farther up the line a man, standing

<P>behind a tree, had had his knee joint splintered

<P>by a ball.&nbsp; Immediately he had dropped his rifle

<P>and gripped the tree with both arms.&nbsp; And there

<P>he remained, clinging desperately and crying for

<P>assistance that he might withdraw his hold upon

<P>the tree.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last an exultant yell went along the quiver-

<P>ing line.&nbsp; The firing dwindled from an uproar to

<P>a last vindictive popping.&nbsp; As the smoke slowly

<P>eddied away, the youth saw that the charge had

<P>been repulsed.&nbsp; The enemy were scattered into

<P>reluctant groups.&nbsp; He saw a man climb to the

<P>top of the fence, straddle the rail, and fire a part-

<P>ing shot.&nbsp; The waves had receded, leaving bits of

<P>dark debris upon the ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some in the regiment began to whoop fren-

<P>ziedly.&nbsp; Many were silent.&nbsp; Apparently they were

<P>trying to contemplate themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After the fever had left his veins, the youth

<P>thought that at last he was going to suffocate.

<P>He became aware of the foul atmosphere in

<P>which he had been struggling.&nbsp; He was grimy

<P>and dripping like a laborer in a foundry.&nbsp; He

<P>grasped his canteen and took a long swallow of

<P>the warmed water.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A sentence with variations went up and down

<P>the line.&nbsp; "Well, we 've helt 'em back.&nbsp; We 've

<P>helt 'em back; derned if we haven't."&nbsp; The men

<P>said it blissfully, leering at each other with dirty

<P>smiles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth turned to look behind him and off

<P>to the right and off to the left.&nbsp; He experienced

<P>the joy of a man who at last finds leisure in which

<P>to look about him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Under foot there were a few ghastly forms

<P>motionless.&nbsp; They lay twisted in fantastic contor-

<P>tions.&nbsp; Arms were bent and heads were turned

<P>in incredible ways.&nbsp; It seemed that the dead men

<P>must have fallen from some great height to get

<P>into such positions.&nbsp; They looked to be dumped

<P>out upon the ground from the sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From a position in the rear of the grove a bat-

<P>tery was throwing shells over it.&nbsp; The flash of

<P>the guns startled the youth at first.&nbsp; He thought

<P>they were aimed directly at him.&nbsp; Through the

<P>trees he watched the black figures of the gunners

<P>as they worked swiftly and intently.&nbsp; Their labor

<P>seemed a complicated thing.&nbsp; He wondered how

<P>they could remember its formula in the midst of

<P>confusion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs.

<P>They argued with abrupt violence.&nbsp; It was a

<P>grim pow-wow.&nbsp; Their busy servants ran hither

<P>and thither.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A small procession of wounded men were go-

<P>ing drearily toward the rear.&nbsp; It was a flow of

<P>blood from the torn body of the brigade.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the right and to the left were the dark

<P>lines of other troops.&nbsp; Far in front he thought he

<P>could see lighter masses protruding in points

<P>from the forest.&nbsp; They were suggestive of un-

<P>numbered thousands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along

<P>the line of the horizon.&nbsp; The tiny riders were

<P>beating the tiny horses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From a sloping hill came the sound of cheer-

<P>ings and clashes.&nbsp; Smoke welled slowly through

<P>the leaves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Batteries were speaking with thunderous ora-

<P>torical effort.&nbsp; Here and there were flags, the

<P>red in the stripes dominating.&nbsp; They splashed

<P>bits of warm color upon the dark lines of

<P>troops.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth felt the old thrill at the sight of

<P>the emblem.&nbsp; They were like beautiful birds

<P>strangely undaunted in a storm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he listened to the din from the hillside, to

<P>a deep pulsating thunder that came from afar to

<P>the left, and to the lesser clamors which came

<P>from many directions, it occurred to him that

<P>they were fighting, too, over there, and over

<P>there, and over there.&nbsp; Heretofore he had sup-

<P>posed that all the battle was directly under his

<P>nose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he gazed around him the youth felt a flash

<P>of astonishment at the blue, pure sky and the

<P>sun gleamings on the trees and fields.&nbsp; It was

<P>surprising that Nature had gone tranquilly on

<P>with her golden process in the midst of so much

<P>devilment.
