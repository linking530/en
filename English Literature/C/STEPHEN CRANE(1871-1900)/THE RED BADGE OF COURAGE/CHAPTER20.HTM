<P>WHEN the two youths turned with the flag

<P>they saw that much of the regiment had crum-

<P>bled away, and the dejected remnant was coming

<P>slowly back.&nbsp; The men, having hurled themselves

<P>in projectile fashion, had presently expended their

<P>forces.&nbsp; They slowly retreated, with their faces

<P>still toward the spluttering woods, and their hot

<P>rifles still replying to the din.&nbsp; Several officers

<P>were giving orders, their voices keyed to screams.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where in hell yeh goin'?" the lieutenant was

<P>asking in a sarcastic howl.&nbsp; And a red-bearded

<P>officer, whose voice of triple brass could plainly

<P>be heard, was commanding: "Shoot into 'em!

<P>Shoot into 'em, Gawd damn their souls!"&nbsp; There

<P>was a melee of screeches, in which the men were

<P>ordered to do conflicting and impossible things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth and his friend had a small scuffle

<P>over the flag.&nbsp; "Give it t' me!"&nbsp; "No, let me

<P>keep it!"&nbsp; Each felt satisfied with the other's pos-

<P>session of it, but each felt bound to declare, by
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>189

<P>an offer to carry the emblem, his willingness to

<P>further risk himself.&nbsp; The youth roughly pushed

<P>his friend away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The regiment fell back to the stolid trees.

<P>There it halted for a moment to blaze at some

<P>dark forms that had begun to steal upon its track.

<P>Presently it resumed its march again, curving

<P>among the tree trunks.&nbsp; By the time the depleted

<P>regiment had again reached the first open space

<P>they were receiving a fast and merciless fire.

<P>There seemed to be mobs all about them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The greater part of the men, discouraged,

<P>their spirits worn by the turmoil, acted as if

<P>stunned.&nbsp; They accepted the pelting of the bul-

<P>lets with bowed and weary heads.&nbsp; It was of no

<P>purpose to strive against walls.&nbsp; It was of no use

<P>to batter themselves against granite.&nbsp; And from

<P>this consciousness that they had attempted to

<P>conquer an unconquerable thing there seemed

<P>to arise a feeling that they had been betrayed.

<P>They glowered with bent brows, but danger-

<P>ously, upon some of the officers, more particu-

<P>larly upon the red-bearded one with the voice of

<P>triple brass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However, the rear of the regiment was fringed

<P>with men, who continued to shoot irritably at the

<P>advancing foes.&nbsp; They seemed resolved to make

<P>every trouble.&nbsp; The youthful lieutenant was per-

<P>haps the last man in the disordered mass.&nbsp; His

<P>forgotten back was toward the enemy.&nbsp; He had

<P>been shot in the arm.&nbsp; It hung straight and rigid.

<P>Occasionally he would cease to remember it, and

<P>be about to emphasize an oath with a sweeping

<P>gesture.&nbsp; The multiplied pain caused him to

<P>swear with incredible power.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth went along with slipping, uncertain

<P>feet.&nbsp; He kept watchful eyes rearward.&nbsp; A scowl

<P>of mortification and rage was upon his face.&nbsp; He

<P>had thought of a fine revenge upon the officer

<P>who had referred to him and his fellows as mule

<P>drivers.&nbsp; But he saw that it could not come to

<P>pass.&nbsp; His dreams had collapsed when the mule

<P>drivers, dwindling rapidly, had wavered and hes-

<P>itated on the little clearing, and then had recoiled.

<P>And now the retreat of the mule drivers was a

<P>march of shame to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A dagger-pointed gaze from without his black-

<P>ened face was held toward the enemy, but his

<P>greater hatred was riveted upon the man, who,

<P>not knowing him, had called him a mule driver.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he knew that he and his comrades had

<P>failed to do anything in successful ways that might

<P>bring the little pangs of a kind of remorse upon

<P>the officer, the youth allowed the rage of the baf-

<P>fled to possess him.&nbsp; This cold officer upon a

<P>monument, who dropped epithets unconcernedly

<P>down, would be finer as a dead man, he thought.

<P>So grievous did he think it that he could

<P>never possess the secret right to taunt truly in

<P>answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had pictured red letters of curious revenge.

<P>"We ARE mule drivers, are we?"&nbsp; And now he

<P>was compelled to throw them away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He presently wrapped his heart in the cloak

<P>of his pride and kept the flag erect.&nbsp; He ha-

<P>rangued his fellows, pushing against their chests

<P>with his free hand.&nbsp; To those he knew well he

<P>made frantic appeals, beseeching them by name.

<P>Between him and the lieutenant, scolding and

<P>near to losing his mind with rage, there was felt a

<P>subtle fellowship and equality.&nbsp; They supported

<P>each other in all manner of hoarse, howling pro-

<P>tests.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the regiment was a machine run down.

<P>The two men babbled at a forceless thing.&nbsp; The

<P>soldiers who had heart to go slowly were con-

<P>tinually shaken in their resolves by a knowledge

<P>that comrades were slipping with speed back to

<P>the lines.&nbsp; It was difficult to think of reputation

<P>when others were thinking of skins.&nbsp; Wounded

<P>men were left crying on this black journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The smoke fringes and flames blustered al-

<P>ways.&nbsp; The youth, peering once through a sud-

<P>den rift in a cloud, saw a brown mass of troops,

<P>interwoven and magnified until they appeared to

<P>be thousands.&nbsp; A fierce-hued flag flashed before

<P>his vision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Immediately, as if the uplifting of the smoke

<P>had been prearranged, the discovered troops

<P>burst into a rasping yell, and a hundred flames

<P>jetted toward the retreating band.&nbsp; A rolling

<P>gray cloud again interposed as the regiment dog-

<P>gedly replied.&nbsp; The youth had to depend again

<P>upon his misused ears, which were trembling

<P>and buzzing from the melee of musketry and yells.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The way seemed eternal.&nbsp; In the clouded haze

<P>men became panicstricken with the thought that

<P>the regiment had lost its path, and was proceed-

<P>ing in a perilous direction.&nbsp; Once the men who

<P>headed the wild procession turned and came push-

<P>ing back against their comrades, screaming that

<P>they were being fired upon from points which

<P>they had considered to be toward their own lines.

<P>At this cry a hysterical fear and dismay beset the

<P>troops.&nbsp; A soldier, who heretofore had been am-

<P>bitious to make the regiment into a wise little

<P>band that would proceed calmly amid the huge-

<P>appearing difficulties, suddenly sank down and

<P>buried his face in his arms with an air of bowing

<P>to a doom.&nbsp; From another a shrill lamentation

<P>rang out filled with profane allusions to a general.

<P>Men ran hither and thither, seeking with their

<P>eyes roads of escape.&nbsp; With serene regularity, as

<P>if controlled by a schedule, bullets buffed into

<P>men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth walked stolidly into the midst of

<P>the mob, and with his flag in his hands took a

<P>stand as if he expected an attempt to push him to

<P>the ground.&nbsp; He unconsciously assumed the atti-

<P>tude of the color bearer in the fight of the pre-

<P>ceding day.&nbsp; He passed over his brow a hand

<P>that trembled.&nbsp; His breath did not come freely.

<P>He was choking during this small wait for the

<P>crisis.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend came to him.&nbsp; "Well, Henry, I

<P>guess this is good-by--John."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, shut up, you damned fool!" replied the

<P>youth, and he would not look at the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The officers labored like politicians to beat

<P>the mass into a proper circle to face the men-

<P>aces.&nbsp; The ground was uneven and torn.&nbsp; The

<P>men curled into depressions and fitted them-

<P>selves snugly behind whatever would frustrate

<P>a bullet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth noted with vague surprise that the

<P>lieutenant was standing mutely with his legs far

<P>apart and his sword held in the manner of a cane.

<P>The youth wondered what had happened to his

<P>vocal organs that he no more cursed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was something curious in this little in-

<P>tent pause of the lieutenant.&nbsp; He was like a babe

<P>which, having wept its fill, raises its eyes and

<P>fixes upon a distant toy.&nbsp; He was engrossed in

<P>this contemplation, and the soft under lip quivered

<P>from self-whispered words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some lazy and ignorant smoke curled slowly.

<P>The men, hiding from the bullets, waited anx-

<P>iously for it to lift and disclose the plight of the

<P>regiment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The silent ranks were suddenly thrilled by the

<P>eager voice of the youthful lieutenant bawling

<P>out: "Here they come!&nbsp; Right onto us,

<P>b'Gawd!"&nbsp; His further words were lost in a roar

<P>of wicked thunder from the men's rifles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's eyes had instantly turned in the

<P>direction indicated by the awakened and agitated

<P>lieutenant, and he had seen the haze of treachery

<P>disclosing a body of soldiers of the enemy.&nbsp; They

<P>were so near that he could see their features.

<P>There was a recognition as he looked at the types

<P>of faces.&nbsp; Also he perceived with dim amazement

<P>that their uniforms were rather gay in effect,

<P>being light gray, accented with a brilliant-hued

<P>facing.&nbsp; Too, the clothes seemed new.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These troops had apparently been going for-

<P>ward with caution, their rifles held in readiness,

<P>when the youthful lieutenant had discovered

<P>them and their movement had been interrupted

<P>by the volley from the blue regiment.&nbsp; From the

<P>moment's glimpse, it was derived that they had

<P>been unaware of the proximity of their dark-

<P>suited foes or had mistaken the direction.&nbsp; Al-

<P>most instantly they were shut utterly from the

<P>youth's sight by the smoke from the energetic

<P>rifles of his companions.&nbsp; He strained his vision

<P>to learn the accomplishment of the volley, but the

<P>smoke hung before him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two bodies of troops exchanged blows in

<P>the manner of a pair of boxers.&nbsp; The fast angry

<P>firings went back and forth.&nbsp; The men in blue

<P>were intent with the despair of their circum-

<P>stances and they seized upon the revenge to be

<P>had at close range.&nbsp; Their thunder swelled loud

<P>and valiant.&nbsp; Their curving front bristled with

<P>flashes and the place resounded with the clangor

<P>of their ramrods.&nbsp; The youth ducked and dodged

<P>for a time and achieved a few unsatisfactory

<P>views of the enemy.&nbsp; There appeared to be many

<P>of them and they were replying swiftly.&nbsp; They

<P>seemed moving toward the blue regiment, step

<P>by step.&nbsp; He seated himself gloomily on the

<P>ground with his flag between his knees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he noted the vicious, wolflike temper of

<P>his comrades he had a sweet thought that if the

<P>enemy was about to swallow the regimental

<P>broom as a large prisoner, it could at least have

<P>the consolation of going down with bristles for-

<P>ward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the blows of the antagonist began to

<P>grow more weak.&nbsp; Fewer bullets ripped the air,

<P>and finally, when the men slackened to learn of

<P>the fight, they could see only dark, floating

<P>smoke.&nbsp; The regiment lay still and gazed.&nbsp; Pres-

<P>ently some chance whim came to the pestering

<P>blur, and it began to coil heavily away.&nbsp; The men

<P>saw a ground vacant of fighters.&nbsp; It would have

<P>been an empty stage if it were not for a few

<P>corpses that lay thrown and twisted into fantastic

<P>shapes upon the sward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At sight of this tableau, many of the men in

<P>blue sprang from behind their covers and made

<P>an ungainly dance of joy.&nbsp; Their eyes burned

<P>and a hoarse cheer of elation broke from their

<P>dry lips.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It had begun to seem to them that events were

<P>trying to prove that they were impotent.&nbsp; These

<P>little battles had evidently endeavored to demon-

<P>strate that the men could not fight well.&nbsp; When

<P>on the verge of submission to these opinions, the

<P>small duel had showed them that the propor-

<P>tions were not impossible, and by it they had

<P>revenged themselves upon their misgivings and

<P>upon the foe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The impetus of enthusiasm was theirs again.

<P>They gazed about them with looks of uplifted

<P>pride, feeling new trust in the grim, always

<P>confident weapons in their hands.&nbsp; And they

<P>were men.
