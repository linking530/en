<P>THE colonel came running along back of the

<P>line.&nbsp; There were other officers following him.

<P>"We must charge'm!" they shouted.&nbsp; "We must

<P>charge'm!" they cried with resentful voices, as

<P>if anticipating a rebellion against this plan by the

<P>men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, upon hearing the shouts, began to

<P>study the distance between him and the enemy.

<P>He made vague calculations.&nbsp; He saw that to be

<P>firm soldiers they must go forward.&nbsp; It would be

<P>death to stay in the present place, and with all

<P>the circumstances to go backward would exalt

<P>too many others.&nbsp; Their hope was to push the

<P>galling foes away from the fence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He expected that his companions, weary and

<P>stiffened, would have to be driven to this assault,

<P>but as he turned toward them he perceived with

<P>a certain surprise that they were giving quick

<P>and unqualified expressions of assent.&nbsp; There was

<P>an ominous, clanging overture to the charge
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>217

<P>when the shafts of the bayonets rattled upon the

<P>rifle barrels.&nbsp; At the yelled words of command

<P>the soldiers sprang forward in eager leaps.

<P>There was new and unexpected force in the

<P>movement of the regiment.&nbsp; A knowledge of its

<P>faded and jaded condition made the charge ap-

<P>pear like a paroxysm, a display of the strength

<P>that comes before a final feebleness.&nbsp; The men

<P>scampered in insane fever of haste, racing as if to

<P>achieve a sudden success before an exhilarating

<P>fluid should leave them.&nbsp; It was a blind and de-

<P>spairing rush by the collection of men in dusty

<P>and tattered blue, over a green sward and under

<P>a sapphire sky, toward a fence, dimly outlined in

<P>smoke, from behind which spluttered the fierce

<P>rifles of enemies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth kept the bright colors to the front.

<P>He was waving his free arm in furious circles,

<P>the while shrieking mad calls and appeals, urging

<P>on those that did not need to be urged, for it

<P>seemed that the mob of blue men hurling them-

<P>selves on the dangerous group of rifles were

<P>again grown suddenly wild with an enthusiasm of

<P>unselfishness.&nbsp; From the many firings starting

<P>toward them, it looked as if they would merely

<P>succeed in making a great sprinkling of corpses

<P>on the grass between their former position and

<P>the fence.&nbsp; But they were in a state of frenzy,

<P>perhaps because of forgotten vanities, and it made

<P>an exhibition of sublime recklessness.&nbsp; There was

<P>no obvious questioning, nor figurings, nor dia-

<P>grams.&nbsp; There was, apparently, no considered

<P>loopholes.&nbsp; It appeared that the swift wings of

<P>their desires would have shattered against the

<P>iron gates of the impossible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He himself felt the daring spirit of a savage

<P>religion mad.&nbsp; He was capable of profound sacri-

<P>fices, a tremendous death.&nbsp; He had no time for

<P>dissections, but he knew that he thought of the

<P>bullets only as things that could prevent him

<P>from reaching the place of his endeavor.&nbsp; There

<P>were subtle flashings of joy within him that thus

<P>should be his mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He strained all his strength.&nbsp; His eyesight

<P>was shaken and dazzled by the tension of thought

<P>and muscle.&nbsp; He did not see anything excepting

<P>the mist of smoke gashed by the little knives of

<P>fire, but he knew that in it lay the aged fence of a

<P>vanished farmer protecting the snuggled bodies

<P>of the gray men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he ran a thought of the shock of contact

<P>gleamed in his mind.&nbsp; He expected a great con-

<P>cussion when the two bodies of troops crashed

<P>together.&nbsp; This became a part of his wild battle

<P>madness.&nbsp; He could feel the onward swing of the

<P>regiment about him and he conceived of a thun-

<P>derous, crushing blow that would prostrate the

<P>resistance and spread consternation and amaze-

<P>ment for miles.&nbsp; The flying regiment was going

<P>to have a catapultian effect.&nbsp; This dream made

<P>him run faster among his comrades, who were

<P>giving vent to hoarse and frantic cheers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But presently he could see that many of the

<P>men in gray did not intend to abide the blow.

<P>The smoke, rolling, disclosed men who ran, their

<P>faces still turned.&nbsp; These grew to a crowd, who

<P>retired stubbornly.&nbsp; Individuals wheeled fre-

<P>quently to send a bullet at the blue wave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But at one part of the line there was a grim

<P>and obdurate group that made no movement.

<P>They were settled firmly down behind posts and

<P>rails.&nbsp; A flag, ruffled and fierce, waved over them

<P>and their rifles dinned fiercely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blue whirl of men got very near, until

<P>it seemed that in truth there would be a close

<P>and frightful scuffle.&nbsp; There was an expressed

<P>disdain in the opposition of the little group,

<P>that changed the meaning of the cheers of the

<P>men in blue.&nbsp; They became yells of wrath,

<P>directed, personal.&nbsp; The cries of the two parties

<P>were now in sound an interchange of scathing

<P>insults.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They in blue showed their teeth; their eyes

<P>shone all white.&nbsp; They launched themselves as at

<P>the throats of those who stood resisting.&nbsp; The

<P>space between dwindled to an insignificant dis-

<P>tance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had centered the gaze of his soul

<P>upon that other flag.&nbsp; Its possession would be

<P>high pride.&nbsp; It would express bloody minglings,

<P>near blows.&nbsp; He had a gigantic hatred for those

<P>who made great difficulties and complications.

<P>They caused it to be as a craved treasure of my-

<P>thology, hung amid tasks and contrivances of

<P>danger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He plunged like a mad horse at it.&nbsp; He was

<P>resolved it should not escape if wild blows and

<P>darings of blows could seize it.&nbsp; His own em-

<P>blem, quivering and aflare, was winging toward

<P>the other.&nbsp; It seemed there would shortly be

<P>an encounter of strange beaks and claws, as of

<P>eagles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The swirling body of blue men came to a

<P>sudden halt at close and disastrous range and

<P>roared a swift volley.&nbsp; The group in gray was

<P>split and broken by this fire, but its riddled body

<P>still fought.&nbsp; The men in blue yelled again and

<P>rushed in upon it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, in his leapings, saw, as through a

<P>mist, a picture of four or five men stretched upon

<P>the ground or writhing upon their knees with

<P>bowed heads as if they had been stricken by bolts

<P>from the sky.&nbsp; Tottering among them was the

<P>rival color bearer, whom the youth saw had been

<P>bitten vitally by the bullets of the last formidable

<P>volley.&nbsp; He perceived this man fighting a last

<P>struggle, the struggle of one whose legs are

<P>grasped by demons.&nbsp; It was a ghastly battle.

<P>Over his face was the bleach of death, but set

<P>upon it was the dark and hard lines of desperate

<P>purpose.&nbsp; With this terrible grin of resolution he

<P>hugged his precious flag to him and was stum-

<P>bling and staggering in his design to go the way

<P>that led to safety for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his wounds always made it seem that his

<P>feet were retarded, held, and he fought a grim

<P>fight, as with invisible ghouls fastened greedily

<P>upon his limbs.&nbsp; Those in advance of the scam-

<P>pering blue men, howling cheers, leaped at the

<P>fence.&nbsp; The despair of the lost was in his eyes as

<P>he glanced back at them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's friend went over the obstruction

<P>in a tumbling heap and sprang at the flag as a

<P>panther at prey.&nbsp; He pulled at it and, wrench-

<P>ing it free, swung up its red brilliancy with a

<P>mad cry of exultation even as the color bearer,

<P>gasping, lurched over in a final throe and, stiff-

<P>ening convulsively, turned his dead face to the

<P>ground.&nbsp; There was much blood upon the grass

<P>blades.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At the place of success there began more wild

<P>clamorings of cheers.&nbsp; The men gesticulated and

<P>bellowed in an ecstasy.&nbsp; When they spoke it was

<P>as if they considered their listener to be a mile

<P>away.&nbsp; What hats and caps were left to them

<P>they often slung high in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At one part of the line four men had been

<P>swooped upon, and they now sat as prisoners.

<P>Some blue men were about them in an eager and

<P>curious circle.&nbsp; The soldiers had trapped strange

<P>birds, and there was an examination.&nbsp; A flurry of

<P>fast questions was in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of the prisoners was nursing a superficial

<P>wound in the foot.&nbsp; He cuddled it, baby-wise,

<P>but he looked up from it often to curse with an

<P>astonishing utter abandon straight at the noses of

<P>his captors.&nbsp; He consigned them to red regions;

<P>he called upon the pestilential wrath of strange

<P>gods.&nbsp; And with it all he was singularly free

<P>from recognition of the finer points of the con-

<P>duct of prisoners of war.&nbsp; It was as if a clumsy

<P>clod had trod upon his toe and he conceived it to

<P>be his privilege, his duty, to use deep, resentful

<P>oaths.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another, who was a boy in years, took his

<P>plight with great calmness and apparent good

<P>nature.&nbsp; He conversed with the men in blue,

<P>studying their faces with his bright and keen

<P>eyes.&nbsp; They spoke of battles and conditions.

<P>There was an acute interest in all their faces dur-

<P>ing this exchange of view points.&nbsp; It seemed a

<P>great satisfaction to hear voices from where all

<P>had been darkness and speculation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The third captive sat with a morose counte-

<P>nance.&nbsp; He preserved a stoical and cold attitude.

<P>To all advances he made one reply without varia-

<P>tion, "Ah, go t' hell!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last of the four was always silent and,

<P>for the most part, kept his face turned in un-

<P>molested directions.&nbsp; From the views the youth

<P>received he seemed to be in a state of absolute

<P>dejection.&nbsp; Shame was upon him, and with it

<P>profound regret that he was, perhaps, no more

<P>to be counted in the ranks of his fellows.&nbsp; The

<P>youth could detect no expression that would

<P>allow him to believe that the other was giving

<P>a thought to his narrowed future, the pictured

<P>dungeons, perhaps, and starvations and brutali-

<P>ties, liable to the imagination.&nbsp; All to be seen

<P>was shame for captivity and regret for the right

<P>to antagonize.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After the men had celebrated sufficiently they

<P>settled down behind the old rail fence, on the

<P>opposite side to the one from which their foes

<P>had been driven.&nbsp; A few shot perfunctorily at

<P>distant marks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was some long grass.&nbsp; The youth

<P>nestled in it and rested, making a convenient rail

<P>support the flag.&nbsp; His friend, jubilant and glori-

<P>fied, holding his treasure with vanity, came to

<P>him there.&nbsp; They sat side by side and congratu-

<P>lated each other.
