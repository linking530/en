<P>THE youth cringed as if discovered in a crime.

<P>By heavens, they had won after all!&nbsp; The im-

<P>becile line had remained and become victors.

<P>He could hear cheering.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He lifted himself upon his toes and looked in

<P>the direction of the fight.&nbsp; A yellow fog lay wal-

<P>lowing on the treetops.&nbsp; From beneath it came

<P>the clatter of musketry.&nbsp; Hoarse cries told of an

<P>advance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned away amazed and angry.&nbsp; He felt

<P>that he had been wronged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had fled, he told himself, because annihila-

<P>tion approached.&nbsp; He had done a good part in

<P>saving himself, who was a little piece of the army.

<P>He had considered the time, he said, to be one in

<P>which it was the duty of every little piece to res-

<P>cue itself if possible.&nbsp; Later the officers could fit

<P>the little pieces together again, and make a battle

<P>front.&nbsp; If none of the little pieces were wise enough

<P>to save themselves from the flurry of death at such

<P>a time, why, then, where would be the army?&nbsp; It

<P>was all plain that he had proceeded according to

<P>very correct and commendable rules.&nbsp; His ac-

<P>tions had been sagacious things.&nbsp; They had been

<P>full of strategy.&nbsp; They were the work of a mas-

<P>ter's legs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thoughts of his comrades came to him.&nbsp; The

<P>brittle blue line had withstood the blows and won.

<P>He grew bitter over it.&nbsp; It seemed that the blind

<P>ignorance and stupidity of those little pieces had

<P>betrayed him.&nbsp; He had been overturned and

<P>crushed by their lack of sense in holding the po-

<P>sition, when intelligent deliberation would have

<P>convinced them that it was impossible.&nbsp; He, the

<P>enlightened man who looks afar in the dark, had

<P>fled because of his superior perceptions and

<P>knowledge.&nbsp; He felt a great anger against his

<P>comrades.&nbsp; He knew it could be proved that

<P>they had been fools.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He wondered what they would remark when

<P>later he appeared in camp.&nbsp; His mind heard

<P>howls of derision.&nbsp; Their density would not en-

<P>able them to understand his sharper point of

<P>view.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He began to pity himself acutely.&nbsp; He was

<P>ill used.&nbsp; He was trodden beneath the feet of an

<P>iron injustice.&nbsp; He had proceeded with wisdom

<P>and from the most righteous motives under

<P>heaven's blue only to be frustrated by hateful

<P>circumstances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A dull, animal-like rebellion against his fel-

<P>lows, war in the abstract, and fate grew within

<P>him.&nbsp; He shambled along with bowed head, his

<P>brain in a tumult of agony and despair.&nbsp; When

<P>he looked loweringly up, quivering at each

<P>sound, his eyes had the expression of those of

<P>a criminal who thinks his guilt and his pun-

<P>ishment great, and knows that he can find no

<P>words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went from the fields into a thick woods, as

<P>if resolved to bury himself.&nbsp; He wished to get

<P>out of hearing of the crackling shots which were

<P>to him like voices.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ground was cluttered with vines and

<P>bushes, and the trees grew close and spread out

<P>like bouquets.&nbsp; He was obliged to force his way

<P>with much noise.&nbsp; The creepers, catching against

<P>his legs, cried out harshly as their sprays were

<P>torn from the barks of trees.&nbsp; The swishing sap-

<P>lings tried to make known his presence to the

<P>world.&nbsp; He could not conciliate the forest.&nbsp; As

<P>he made his way, it was always calling out prot-

<P>estations.&nbsp; When he separated embraces of trees

<P>and vines the disturbed foliages waved their arms

<P>and turned their face leaves toward him.&nbsp; He

<P>dreaded lest these noisy motions and cries should

<P>bring men to look at him.&nbsp; So he went far, seek-

<P>ing dark and intricate places.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time the sound of musketry grew faint

<P>and the cannon boomed in the distance.&nbsp; The sun,

<P>suddenly apparent, blazed among the trees.&nbsp; The

<P>insects were making rhythmical noises.&nbsp; They

<P>seemed to be grinding their teeth in unison.&nbsp; A

<P>woodpecker stuck his impudent head around the

<P>side of a tree.&nbsp; A bird flew on lighthearted wing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Off was the rumble of death.&nbsp; It seemed now

<P>that Nature had no ears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This landscape gave him assurance.&nbsp; A fair

<P>field holding life.&nbsp; It was the religion of peace.

<P>It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to

<P>see blood.&nbsp; He conceived Nature to be a woman

<P>with a deep aversion to tragedy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and

<P>he ran with chattering fear.&nbsp; High in a treetop

<P>he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from

<P>behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepi-

<P>dation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition.

<P>There was the law, he said.&nbsp; Nature had given

<P>him a sign.&nbsp; The squirrel, immediately upon rec-

<P>ognizing danger, had taken to his legs without

<P>ado.&nbsp; He did not stand stolidly baring his furry

<P>belly to the missile, and die with an upward

<P>glance at the sympathetic heavens.&nbsp; On the con-

<P>trary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry

<P>him; and he was but an ordinary squirrel, too--

<P>doubtless no philosopher of his race.&nbsp; The youth

<P>wended, feeling that Nature was of his mind.

<P>She re-enforced his argument with proofs that

<P>lived where the sun shone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he found himself almost into a swamp.

<P>He was obliged to walk upon bog tufts and

<P>watch his feet to keep from the oily mire.&nbsp; Paus-

<P>ing at one time to look about him he saw, out at

<P>some black water, a small animal pounce in and

<P>emerge directly with a gleaming fish.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth went again into the deep thickets.

<P>The brushed branches made a noise that drowned

<P>the sounds of cannon.&nbsp; He walked on, going from

<P>obscurity into promises of a greater obscurity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At length he reached a place where the high,

<P>arching boughs made a chapel.&nbsp; He softly pushed

<P>the green doors aside and entered.&nbsp; Pine needles

<P>were a gentle brown carpet.&nbsp; There was a reli-

<P>gious half light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Near the threshold he stopped, horror-stricken

<P>at the sight of a thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was being looked at by a dead man who

<P>was seated with his back against a columnlike

<P>tree.&nbsp; The corpse was dressed in a uniform that

<P>once had been blue, but was now faded to a mel-

<P>ancholy shade of green.&nbsp; The eyes, staring at the

<P>youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen on

<P>the side of a dead fish.&nbsp; The mouth was open.

<P>Its red had changed to an appalling yellow.

<P>Over the gray skin of the face ran little ants.

<P>One was trundling some sort of a bundle along

<P>the upper lip.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth gave a shriek as he confronted the

<P>thing.&nbsp; He was for moments turned to stone be-

<P>fore it.&nbsp; He remained staring into the liquid-look-

<P>ing eyes.&nbsp; The dead man and the living man ex-

<P>changed a long look.&nbsp; Then the youth cautiously

<P>put one hand behind him and brought it against

<P>a tree.&nbsp; Leaning upon this he retreated, step by

<P>step, with his face still toward the thing.&nbsp; He

<P>feared that if he turned his back the body might

<P>spring up and stealthily pursue him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The branches, pushing against him, threat-

<P>ened to throw him over upon it.&nbsp; His unguided

<P>feet, too, caught aggravatingly in brambles; and

<P>with it all he received a subtle suggestion to

<P>touch the corpse.&nbsp; As he thought of his hand

<P>upon it he shuddered profoundly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last he burst the bonds which had fastened

<P>him to the spot and fled, unheeding the under-

<P>brush.&nbsp; He was pursued by a sight of the black

<P>ants swarming greedily upon the gray face and

<P>venturing horribly near to the eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time he paused, and, breathless and

<P>panting, listened.&nbsp; He imagined some strange

<P>voice would come from the dead throat and

<P>squawk after him in horrible menaces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The trees about the portal of the chapel

<P>moved soughingly in a soft wind.&nbsp; A sad silence

<P>was upon the little guarding edifice.
