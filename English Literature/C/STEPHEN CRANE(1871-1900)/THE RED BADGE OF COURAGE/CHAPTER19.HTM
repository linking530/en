<P>THE youth stared at the land in front of him.

<P>Its foliages now seemed to veil powers and hor-

<P>rors.&nbsp; He was unaware of the machinery of orders

<P>that started the charge, although from the cor-

<P>ners of his eyes he saw an officer, who looked

<P>like a boy a-horseback, come galloping, waving

<P>his hat.&nbsp; Suddenly he felt a straining and heaving

<P>among the men.&nbsp; The line fell slowly forward

<P>like a toppling wall, and, with a convulsive gasp

<P>that was intended for a cheer, the regiment began

<P>its journey.&nbsp; The youth was pushed and jostled

<P>for a moment before he understood the move-

<P>ment at all, but directly he lunged ahead and

<P>began to run.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He fixed his eye upon a distant and promi-

<P>nent clump of trees where he had concluded the

<P>enemy were to be met, and he ran toward it as

<P>toward a goal.&nbsp; He had believed throughout that

<P>it was a mere question of getting over an unpleas-

<P>ant matter as quickly as possible, and he ran
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>179

<P>desperately, as if pursued for a murder.&nbsp; His

<P>face was drawn hard and tight with the stress of

<P>his endeavor.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed in a lurid

<P>glare.&nbsp; And with his soiled and disordered dress,

<P>his red and inflamed features surmounted by the

<P>dingy rag with its spot of blood, his wildly

<P>swinging rifle and banging accouterments, he

<P>looked to be an insane soldier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the regiment swung from its position out

<P>into a cleared space the woods and thickets be-

<P>fore it awakened.&nbsp; Yellow flames leaped toward

<P>it from many directions.&nbsp; The forest made a tre-

<P>mendous objection.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The line lurched straight for a moment.&nbsp; Then

<P>the right wing swung forward; it in turn was

<P>surpassed by the left.&nbsp; Afterward the center

<P>careered to the front until the regiment was a

<P>wedge-shaped mass, but an instant later the

<P>opposition of the bushes, trees, and uneven places

<P>on the ground split the command and scattered

<P>it into detached clusters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, light-footed, was unconsciously in

<P>advance.&nbsp; His eyes still kept note of the clump of

<P>trees.&nbsp; From all places near it the clannish yell

<P>of the enemy could be heard.&nbsp; The little flames

<P>of rifles leaped from it.&nbsp; The song of the bullets

<P>was in the air and shells snarled among the tree-

<P>tops.&nbsp; One tumbled directly into the middle of a

<P>hurrying group and exploded in crimson fury.

<P>There was an instant's spectacle of a man, almost

<P>over it, throwing up his hands to shield his eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Other men, punched by bullets, fell in gro-

<P>tesque agonies.&nbsp; The regiment left a coherent

<P>trail of bodies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had passed into a clearer atmosphere.

<P>There was an effect like a revelation in the new

<P>appearance of the landscape.&nbsp; Some men work-

<P>ing madly at a battery were plain to them, and

<P>the opposing infantry's lines were defined by the

<P>gray walls and fringes of smoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It seemed to the youth that he saw every-

<P>thing.&nbsp; Each blade of the green grass was bold

<P>and clear.&nbsp; He thought that he was aware of

<P>every change in the thin, transparent vapor that

<P>floated idly in sheets.&nbsp; The brown or gray trunks

<P>of the trees showed each roughness of their sur-

<P>faces.&nbsp; And the men of the regiment, with their

<P>starting eyes and sweating faces, running madly,

<P>or falling, as if thrown headlong, to queer,

<P>heaped-up corpses--all were comprehended.&nbsp; His

<P>mind took a mechanical but firm impression, so

<P>that afterward everything was pictured and ex-

<P>plained to him, save why he himself was there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But there was a frenzy made from this furious

<P>rush.&nbsp; The men, pitching forward insanely, had

<P>burst into cheerings, moblike and barbaric, but

<P>tuned in strange keys that can arouse the dullard

<P>and the stoic.&nbsp; It made a mad enthusiasm that, it

<P>seemed, would be incapable of checking itself

<P>before granite and brass.&nbsp; There was the deli-

<P>rium that encounters despair and death, and is

<P>heedless and blind to the odds.&nbsp; It is a temporary

<P>but sublime absence of selfishness.&nbsp; And because

<P>it was of this order was the reason, perhaps, why

<P>the youth wondered, afterward, what reasons he

<P>could have had for being there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently the straining pace ate up the ener-

<P>gies of the men.&nbsp; As if by agreement, the leaders

<P>began to slacken their speed.&nbsp; The volleys di-

<P>rected against them had had a seeming windlike

<P>effect.&nbsp; The regiment snorted and blew.&nbsp; Among

<P>some stolid trees it began to falter and hesitate.

<P>The men, staring intently, began to wait for some

<P>of the distant walls of smoke to move and dis-

<P>close to them the scene.&nbsp; Since much of their

<P>strength and their breath had vanished, they re-

<P>turned to caution.&nbsp; They were become men

<P>again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had a vague belief that he had run

<P>miles, and he thought, in a way, that he was now

<P>in some new and unknown land.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The moment the regiment ceased its advance

<P>the protesting splutter of musketry became a

<P>steadied roar.&nbsp; Long and accurate fringes of

<P>smoke spread out.&nbsp; From the top of a small hill

<P>came level belchings of yellow flame that caused

<P>an inhuman whistling in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men, halted, had opportunity to see some

<P>of their comrades dropping with moans and

<P>shrieks.&nbsp; A few lay under foot, still or wailing.

<P>And now for an instant the men stood, their rifles

<P>slack in their hands, and watched the regiment

<P>dwindle.&nbsp; They appeared dazed and stupid.&nbsp; This

<P>spectacle seemed to paralyze them, overcome

<P>them with a fatal fascination.&nbsp; They stared wood-

<P>enly at the sights, and, lowering their eyes, looked

<P>from face to face.&nbsp; It was a strange pause, and a

<P>strange silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, above the sounds of the outside commo-

<P>tion, arose the roar of the lieutenant.&nbsp; He strode

<P>suddenly forth, his infantile features black with

<P>rage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come on, yeh fools!" he bellowed.&nbsp; "Come

<P>on!&nbsp; Yeh can't stay here.&nbsp; Yeh must come on."

<P>He said more, but much of it could not be under-

<P>stood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He started rapidly forward, with his head

<P>turned toward the men.&nbsp; "Come on," he was

<P>shouting.&nbsp; The men stared with blank and yokel-

<P>like eyes at him.&nbsp; He was obliged to halt and

<P>retrace his steps.&nbsp; He stood then with his back

<P>to the enemy and delivered gigantic curses into

<P>the faces of the men.&nbsp; His body vibrated from

<P>the weight and force of his imprecations.&nbsp; And

<P>he could string oaths with the facility of a maiden

<P>who strings beads.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend of the youth aroused.&nbsp; Lurching

<P>suddenly forward and dropping to his knees, he

<P>fired an angry shot at the persistent woods.&nbsp; This

<P>action awakened the men.&nbsp; They huddled no

<P>more like sheep.&nbsp; They seemed suddenly to be-

<P>think them of their weapons, and at once com-

<P>menced firing.&nbsp; Belabored by their officers, they

<P>began to move forward.&nbsp; The regiment, involved

<P>like a cart involved in mud and muddle, started

<P>unevenly with many jolts and jerks.&nbsp; The men

<P>stopped now every few paces to fire and load,

<P>and in this manner moved slowly on from trees

<P>to trees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The flaming opposition in their front grew

<P>with their advance until it seemed that all for-

<P>ward ways were barred by the thin leaping

<P>tongues, and off to the right an ominous demon-

<P>stration could sometimes be dimly discerned.

<P>The smoke lately generated was in confusing

<P>clouds that made it difficult for the regiment to

<P>proceed with intelligence.&nbsp; As he passed through

<P>each curling mass the youth wondered what

<P>would confront him on the farther side.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The command went painfully forward until an

<P>open space interposed between them and the

<P>lurid lines.&nbsp; Here, crouching and cowering be-

<P>hind some trees, the men clung with desperation,

<P>as if threatened by a wave.&nbsp; They looked wild-

<P>eyed, and as if amazed at this furious disturbance

<P>they had stirred.&nbsp; In the storm there was an

<P>ironical expression of their importance.&nbsp; The

<P>faces of the men, too, showed a lack of a certain

<P>feeling of responsibility for being there.&nbsp; It was

<P>as if they had been driven.&nbsp; It was the dominant

<P>animal failing to remember in the supreme mo-

<P>ments the forceful causes of various superficial

<P>qualities.&nbsp; The whole affair seemed incompre-

<P>hensible to many of them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they halted thus the lieutenant again be-

<P>gan to bellow profanely.&nbsp; Regardless of the vin-

<P>dictive threats of the bullets, he went about

<P>coaxing, berating, and bedamning.&nbsp; His lips,

<P>that were habitually in a soft and childlike curve,

<P>were now writhed into unholy contortions.&nbsp; He

<P>swore by all possible deities.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he grabbed the youth by the arm.

<P>"Come on, yeh lunkhead!" he roared.&nbsp; "Come

<P>on!&nbsp; We'll all git killed if we stay here.&nbsp; We've

<P>on'y got t' go across that lot.&nbsp; An' then"--the

<P>remainder of his idea disappeared in a blue haze

<P>of curses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth stretched forth his arm.&nbsp; "Cross

<P>there?"&nbsp; His mouth was puckered in doubt and

<P>awe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; Jest 'cross th' lot!&nbsp; We can't

<P>stay here," screamed the lieutenant.&nbsp; He poked

<P>his face close to the youth and waved his ban-

<P>daged hand.&nbsp; "Come on!"&nbsp; Presently he grap-

<P>pled with him as if for a wrestling bout.&nbsp; It was

<P>as if he planned to drag the youth by the ear on

<P>to the assault.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The private felt a sudden unspeakable indig-

<P>nation against his officer.&nbsp; He wrenched fiercely

<P>and shook him off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come on herself, then," he yelled.&nbsp; There

<P>was a bitter challenge in his voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They galloped together down the regimental

<P>front.&nbsp; The friend scrambled after them.&nbsp; In front

<P>of the colors the three men began to bawl:

<P>"Come on! come on!"&nbsp; They danced and gy-

<P>rated like tortured savages.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The flag, obedient to these appeals, bended its

<P>glittering form and swept toward them.&nbsp; The

<P>men wavered in indecision for a moment, and then

<P>with a long, wailful cry the dilapidated regiment

<P>surged forward and began its new journey.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Over the field went the scurrying mass.&nbsp; It

<P>was a handful of men splattered into the faces of

<P>the enemy.&nbsp; Toward it instantly sprang the yel-

<P>low tongues.&nbsp; A vast quantity of blue smoke

<P>hung before them.&nbsp; A mighty banging made ears

<P>valueless.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth ran like a madman to reach the

<P>woods before a bullet could discover him.&nbsp; He

<P>ducked his head low, like a football player.&nbsp; In

<P>his haste his eyes almost closed, and the scene was

<P>a wild blur.&nbsp; Pulsating saliva stood at the corners

<P>of his mouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Within him, as he hurled himself forward, was

<P>born a love, a despairing fondness for this flag

<P>which was near him.&nbsp; It was a creation of beauty

<P>and invulnerability.&nbsp; It was a goddess, radiant,

<P>that bended its form with an imperious gesture to

<P>him.&nbsp; It was a woman, red and white, hating and

<P>loving, that called him with the voice of his

<P>hopes.&nbsp; Because no harm could come to it he en-

<P>dowed it with power.&nbsp; He kept near, as if it

<P>could be a saver of lives, and an imploring cry

<P>went from his mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the mad scramble he was aware that the

<P>color sergeant flinched suddenly, as if struck by a

<P>bludgeon.&nbsp; He faltered, and then became motion-

<P>less, save for his quivering knees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He made a spring and a clutch at the pole.

<P>At the same instant his friend grabbed it from the

<P>other side.&nbsp; They jerked at it, stout and furious,

<P>but the color sergeant was dead, and the corpse

<P>would not relinquish its trust.&nbsp; For a moment

<P>there was a grim encounter.&nbsp; The dead man,

<P>swinging with bended back, seemed to be obsti-

<P>nately tugging, in ludicrous and awful ways, for

<P>the possession of the flag.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was past in an instant of time.&nbsp; They

<P>wrenched the flag furiously from the dead man,

<P>and, as they turned again, the corpse swayed for-

<P>ward with bowed head.&nbsp; One arm swung high,

<P>and the curved hand fell with heavy protest on

<P>the friend's unheeding shoulder.
