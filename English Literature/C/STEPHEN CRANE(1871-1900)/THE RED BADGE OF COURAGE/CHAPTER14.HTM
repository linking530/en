<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WHEN the youth awoke it seemed to him that

<P>he had been asleep for a thousand years, and he

<P>felt sure that he opened his eyes upon an unex-

<P>pected world.&nbsp; Gray mists were slowly shifting

<P>before the first efforts of the sun rays.&nbsp; An im-

<P>pending splendor could be seen in the eastern

<P>sky.&nbsp; An icy dew had chilled his face, and im-

<P>mediately upon arousing he curled farther down

<P>into his blanket.&nbsp; He stared for a while at the

<P>leaves overhead, moving in a heraldic wind of

<P>the day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The distance was splintering and blaring with

<P>the noise of fighting.&nbsp; There was in the sound

<P>an expression of a deadly persistency, as if it had

<P>not begun and was not to cease.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>About him were the rows and groups of men

<P>that he had dimly seen the previous night.&nbsp; They

<P>were getting a last draught of sleep before the

<P>awakening.&nbsp; The gaunt, careworn features and

<P>dusty figures were made plain by this quaint
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>139

<P>light at the dawning, but it dressed the skin of

<P>the men in corpselike hues and made the tangled

<P>limbs appear pulseless and dead.&nbsp; The youth

<P>started up with a little cry when his eyes first

<P>swept over this motionless mass of men, thick-

<P>spread upon the ground, pallid, and in strange

<P>postures.&nbsp; His disordered mind interpreted the

<P>hall of the forest as a charnel place.&nbsp; He believed

<P>for an instant that he was in the house of the

<P>dead, and he did not dare to move lest these

<P>corpses start up, squalling and squawking.&nbsp; In a

<P>second, however, he achieved his proper mind.

<P>He swore a complicated oath at himself.&nbsp; He

<P>saw that this somber picture was not a fact of

<P>the present, but a mere prophecy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He heard then the noise of a fire crackling

<P>briskly in the cold air, and, turning his head, he

<P>saw his friend pottering busily about a small

<P>blaze.&nbsp; A few other figures moved in the fog, and

<P>he heard the hard cracking of axe blows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly there was a hollow rumble of

<P>drums.&nbsp; A distant bugle sang faintly.&nbsp; Similar

<P>sounds, varying in strength, came from near and

<P>far over the forest.&nbsp; The bugles called to each

<P>other like brazen gamecocks.&nbsp; The near thunder

<P>of the regimental drums rolled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The body of men in the woods rustled.&nbsp; There

<P>was a general uplifting of heads.&nbsp; A murmuring

<P>of voices broke upon the air.&nbsp; In it there was

<P>much bass of grumbling oaths.&nbsp; Strange gods

<P>were addressed in condemnation of the early

<P>hours necessary to correct war.&nbsp; An officer's

<P>peremptory tenor rang out and quickened the

<P>stiffened movement of the men.&nbsp; The tangled

<P>limbs unraveled.&nbsp; The corpse-hued faces were

<P>hidden behind fists that twisted slowly in the eye

<P>sockets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth sat up and gave vent to an enormous

<P>yawn.&nbsp; "Thunder!" he remarked petulantly.

<P>He rubbed his eyes, and then putting up his hand

<P>felt carefully of the bandage over his wound.

<P>His friend, perceiving him to be awake, came

<P>from the fire.&nbsp; "Well, Henry, ol' man, how do

<P>yeh feel this mornin'?" he demanded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth yawned again.&nbsp; Then he puckered

<P>his mouth to a little pucker.&nbsp; His head, in truth,

<P>felt precisely like a melon, and there was an un-

<P>pleasant sensation at his stomach.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Lord, I feel pretty bad," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thunder!" exclaimed the other.&nbsp; "I hoped

<P>ye'd feel all right this mornin'.&nbsp; Let's see th'

<P>bandage--I guess it's slipped."&nbsp; He began to

<P>tinker at the wound in rather a clumsy way until

<P>the youth exploded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gosh-dern it!" he said in sharp irritation;

<P>"you're the hangdest man I ever saw!&nbsp; You

<P>wear muffs on your hands.&nbsp; Why in good

<P>thunderation can't you be more easy?&nbsp; I'd rather

<P>you'd stand off an' throw guns at it.&nbsp; Now, go

<P>slow, an' don't act as if you was nailing down

<P>carpet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He glared with insolent command at his

<P>friend, but the latter answered soothingly.

<P>"Well, well, come now, an' git some grub," he

<P>said.&nbsp; "Then, maybe, yeh'll feel better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At the fireside the loud young soldier

<P>watched over his comrade's wants with tender-

<P>ness and care.&nbsp; He was very busy marshaling

<P>the little black vagabonds of tin cups and pour-

<P>ing into them the streaming, iron colored mixture

<P>from a small and sooty tin pail.&nbsp; He had some

<P>fresh meat, which he roasted hurriedly upon a

<P>stick.&nbsp; He sat down then and contemplated the

<P>youth's appetite with glee.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth took note of a remarkable change

<P>in his comrade since those days of camp life upon

<P>the river bank.&nbsp; He seemed no more to be con-

<P>tinually regarding the proportions of his personal

<P>prowess.&nbsp; He was not furious at small words that

<P>pricked his conceits.&nbsp; He was no more a loud

<P>young soldier.&nbsp; There was about him now a

<P>fine reliance.&nbsp; He showed a quiet belief in

<P>his purposes and his abilities.&nbsp; And this in-

<P>ward confidence evidently enabled him to be

<P>indifferent to little words of other men aimed

<P>at him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth reflected.&nbsp; He had been used to

<P>regarding his comrade as a blatant child with an

<P>audacity grown from his inexperience, thought-

<P>less, headstrong, jealous, and filled with a tinsel

<P>courage.&nbsp; A swaggering babe accustomed to strut

<P>in his own dooryard.&nbsp; The youth wondered

<P>where had been born these new eyes; when his

<P>comrade had made the great discovery that

<P>there were many men who would refuse to be

<P>subjected by him.&nbsp; Apparently, the other had

<P>now climbed a peak of wisdom from which he

<P>could perceive himself as a very wee thing.&nbsp; And

<P>the youth saw that ever after it would be easier

<P>to live in his friend's neighborhood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His comrade balanced his ebony coffee-cup on

<P>his knee.&nbsp; "Well, Henry," he said, "what d'yeh

<P>think th' chances are?&nbsp; D'yeh think we'll wal-

<P>lop 'em?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth considered for a moment.&nbsp; "Day-

<P>b'fore-yesterday," he finally replied, with boldness,

<P>"you would 'a' bet you'd lick the hull kit-an'-

<P>boodle all by yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend looked a trifle amazed.&nbsp; "Would

<P>I?" he asked.&nbsp; He pondered.&nbsp; "Well, perhaps I

<P>would," he decided at last.&nbsp; He stared humbly at

<P>the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth was quite disconcerted at this sur-

<P>prising reception of his remarks.&nbsp; "Oh, no, you

<P>wouldn't either," he said, hastily trying to re-

<P>trace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the other made a deprecating gesture.

<P>"Oh, yeh needn't mind, Henry," he said.&nbsp; "I be-

<P>lieve I was a pretty big fool in those days."&nbsp; He

<P>spoke as after a lapse of years.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a little pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All th' officers say we've got th' rebs in

<P>a pretty tight box," said the friend, clearing

<P>his throat in a commonplace way.&nbsp; "They all

<P>seem t' think we've got 'em jest where we

<P>want 'em."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't know about that," the youth replied.

<P>"What I seen over on th' right makes me think

<P>it was th' other way about.&nbsp; From where I was,

<P>it looked as if we was gettin' a good poundin'

<P>yestirday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"D'yeh think so?" inquired the friend.&nbsp; "I

<P>thought we handled 'em pretty rough yestir-

<P>day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a bit," said the youth.&nbsp; "Why, lord,

<P>man, you didn't see nothing of the fight.&nbsp; Why!"

<P>Then a sudden thought came to him.&nbsp; "Oh!

<P>Jim Conklin's dead."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend started.&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; Is he?&nbsp; Jim

<P>Conklin?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth spoke slowly.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; He's dead.

<P>Shot in th' side."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh don't say so.&nbsp; Jim Conklin. . . . poor

<P>cuss!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All about them were other small fires sur-

<P>rounded by men with their little black utensils.

<P>From one of these near came sudden sharp

<P>voices in a row.&nbsp; It appeared that two light-

<P>footed soldiers had been teasing a huge, bearded

<P>man, causing him to spill coffee upon his blue

<P>knees.&nbsp; The man had gone into a rage and had

<P>sworn comprehensively.&nbsp; Stung by his language,

<P>his tormentors had immediately bristled at him

<P>with a great show of resenting unjust oaths.

<P>Possibly there was going to be a fight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend arose and went over to them, mak-

<P>ing pacific motions with his arms.&nbsp; "Oh, here,

<P>now, boys, what's th' use?" he said.&nbsp; "We'll

<P>be at th' rebs in less'n an hour.&nbsp; What's th'

<P>good fightin' 'mong ourselves?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of the light-footed soldiers turned upon

<P>him red-faced and violent.&nbsp; "Yeh needn't come

<P>around here with yer preachin'.&nbsp; I s'pose yeh

<P>don't approve 'a fightin' since Charley Morgan

<P>licked yeh; but I don't see what business this

<P>here is 'a yours or anybody else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, it ain't," said the friend mildly.&nbsp; "Still

<P>I hate t' see--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a tangled argument.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, he--," said the two, indicating their

<P>opponent with accusative forefingers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The huge soldier was quite purple with rage.

<P>He pointed at the two soldiers with his great

<P>hand, extended clawlike.&nbsp; "Well, they--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But during this argumentative time the de-

<P>sire to deal blows seemed to pass, although they

<P>said much to each other.&nbsp; Finally the friend re-

<P>turned to his old seat.&nbsp; In a short while the

<P>three antagonists could be seen together in an

<P>amiable bunch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jimmie Rogers ses I'll have t' fight him

<P>after th' battle t'-day," announced the friend as

<P>he again seated himself.&nbsp; "He ses he don't

<P>allow no interferin' in his business.&nbsp; I hate t' see

<P>th' boys fightin' 'mong themselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth laughed.&nbsp; "Yer changed a good

<P>bit.&nbsp; Yeh ain't at all like yeh was.&nbsp; I remember

<P>when you an' that Irish feller--"&nbsp; He stopped

<P>and laughed again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I didn't use t' be that way," said his

<P>friend thoughtfully.&nbsp; "That's true 'nough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I didn't mean--" began the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend made another deprecatory gesture.

<P>"Oh, yeh needn't mind, Henry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was another little pause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Th' reg'ment lost over half th' men yestir-

<P>day," remarked the friend eventually.&nbsp; "I thought

<P>a course they was all dead, but, laws, they kep'

<P>a-comin' back last night until it seems, after all,

<P>we didn't lose but a few.&nbsp; They'd been scattered

<P>all over, wanderin' around in th' woods, fightin'

<P>with other reg'ments, an' everything.&nbsp; Jest like

<P>you done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So?" said the youth.
