<P>WHEN another night came the columns,

<P>changed to purple streaks, filed across two pon-

<P>toon bridges.&nbsp; A glaring fire wine-tinted the

<P>waters of the river.&nbsp; Its rays, shining upon the

<P>moving masses of troops, brought forth here and

<P>there sudden gleams of silver or gold.&nbsp; Upon

<P>the other shore a dark and mysterious range of

<P>hills was curved against the sky.&nbsp; The insect

<P>voices of the night sang solemnly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this crossing the youth assured himself

<P>that at any moment they might be suddenly and

<P>fearfully assaulted from the caves of the lowering

<P>woods.&nbsp; He kept his eyes watchfully upon the

<P>darkness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his regiment went unmolested to a camp-

<P>ing place, and its soldiers slept the brave sleep

<P>of wearied men.&nbsp; In the morning they were

<P>routed out with early energy, and hustled along

<P>a narrow road that led deep into the forest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was during this rapid march that the regiment
<BR>lost many of the marks of a new com-

<P>mand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men had begun to count the miles upon

<P>their fingers, and they grew tired.&nbsp; "Sore feet

<P>an' damned short rations, that's all," said the

<P>loud soldier.&nbsp; There was perspiration and grum-

<P>blings.&nbsp; After a time they began to shed their

<P>knapsacks.&nbsp; Some tossed them unconcernedly

<P>down; others hid them carefully, asserting their

<P>plans to return for them at some convenient

<P>time.&nbsp; Men extricated themselves from thick

<P>shirts.&nbsp; Presently few carried anything but their

<P>necessary clothing, blankets, haversacks, canteens,

<P>and arms and ammunition.&nbsp; "You can now eat

<P>and shoot," said the tall soldier to the youth.

<P>"That's all you want to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was sudden change from the ponderous

<P>infantry of theory to the light and speedy infantry

<P>of practice.&nbsp; The regiment, relieved of a burden,

<P>received a new impetus.&nbsp; But there was much

<P>loss of valuable knapsacks, and, on the whole,

<P>very good shirts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the regiment was not yet veteranlike in

<P>appearance.&nbsp; Veteran regiments in the army

<P>were likely to be very small aggregations of men.

<P>Once, when the command had first come to the

<P>field, some perambulating veterans, noting the

<P>length of their column, had accosted them thus:

<P>"Hey, fellers, what brigade is that?"&nbsp; And when

<P>the men had replied that they formed a regiment

<P>and not a brigade, the older soldiers had laughed,

<P>and said, "O Gawd!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Also, there was too great a similarity in the

<P>hats.&nbsp; The hats of a regiment should properly

<P>represent the history of headgear for a period of

<P>years.&nbsp; And, moreover, there were no letters of

<P>faded gold speaking from the colors.&nbsp; They were

<P>new and beautiful, and the color bearer habitu-

<P>ally oiled the pole.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently the army again sat down to think.

<P>The odor of the peaceful pines was in the men's

<P>nostrils.&nbsp; The sound of monotonous axe blows

<P>rang through the forest, and the insects, nodding

<P>upon their perches, crooned like old women.

<P>The youth returned to his theory of a blue dem-

<P>onstration.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One gray dawn, however, he was kicked in

<P>the leg by the tall soldier, and then, before he

<P>was entirely awake, he found himself running

<P>down a wood road in the midst of men who were

<P>panting from the first effects of speed.&nbsp; His can-

<P>teen banged rhythmically upon his thigh, and his

<P>haversack bobbed softly.&nbsp; His musket bounced

<P>a trifle from his shoulder at each stride and made

<P>his cap feel uncertain upon his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He could hear the men whisper jerky sen-

<P>tences: "Say--what's all this--about?"&nbsp; "What

<P>th' thunder--we--skedaddlin' this way fer?"

<P>"Billie--keep off m' feet.&nbsp; Yeh run--like a cow."

<P>And the loud soldier's shrill voice could be

<P>heard: "What th' devil they in sich a hurry for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth thought the damp fog of early

<P>morning moved from the rush of a great body

<P>of troops.&nbsp; From the distance came a sudden

<P>spatter of firing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was bewildered.&nbsp; As he ran with his com-

<P>rades he strenuously tried to think, but all he knew

<P>was that if he fell down those coming behind

<P>would tread upon him.&nbsp; All his faculties seemed

<P>to be needed to guide him over and past obstruc-

<P>tions.&nbsp; He felt carried along by a mob.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sun spread disclosing rays, and, one by

<P>one, regiments burst into view like armed men

<P>just born of the earth.&nbsp; The youth perceived

<P>that the time had come.&nbsp; He was about to be

<P>measured.&nbsp; For a moment he felt in the face of

<P>his great trial like a babe, and the flesh over

<P>his heart seemed very thin.&nbsp; He seized time to

<P>look about him calculatingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he instantly saw that it would be impossi-

<P>ble for him to escape from the regiment.&nbsp; It in-

<P>closed him.&nbsp; And there were iron laws of tradi-

<P>tion and law on four sides.&nbsp; He was in a moving

<P>box.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he perceived this fact it occurred to him

<P>that he had never wished to come to the war.

<P>He had not enlisted of his free will.&nbsp; He had

<P>been dragged by the merciless government.&nbsp; And

<P>now they were taking him out to be slaughtered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The regiment slid down a bank and wallowed

<P>across a little stream.&nbsp; The mournful current

<P>moved slowly on, and from the water, shaded

<P>black, some white bubble eyes looked at the men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they climbed the hill on the farther side

<P>artillery began to boom.&nbsp; Here the youth forgot

<P>many things as he felt a sudden impulse of curi-

<P>osity.&nbsp; He scrambled up the bank with a speed

<P>that could not be exceeded by a bloodthirsty

<P>man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He expected a battle scene.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were some little fields girted and

<P>squeezed by a forest.&nbsp; Spread over the grass and

<P>in among the tree trunks, he could see knots and

<P>waving lines of skirmishers who were running

<P>hither and thither and firing at the landscape.

<P>A dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck clearing

<P>that gleamed orange color.&nbsp; A flag fluttered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Other regiments floundered up the bank.&nbsp; The

<P>brigade was formed in line of battle, and after a

<P>pause started slowly through the woods in the

<P>rear of the receding skirmishers, who were con-

<P>tinually melting into the scene to appear again

<P>farther on.&nbsp; They were always busy as bees,

<P>deeply absorbed in their little combats.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth tried to observe everything.&nbsp; He

<P>did not use care to avoid trees and branches,

<P>and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking

<P>against stones or getting entangled in briers.

<P>He was aware that these battalions with their

<P>commotions were woven red and startling into

<P>the gentle fabric of softened greens and browns.

<P>It looked to be a wrong place for a battle field.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The skirmishers in advance fascinated him.

<P>Their shots into thickets and at distant and

<P>prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies--hid-

<P>den, mysterious, solemn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once the line encountered the body of a dead

<P>soldier.&nbsp; He lay upon his back staring at the sky.

<P>He was dressed in an awkward suit of yellowish

<P>brown.&nbsp; The youth could see that the soles of his

<P>shoes had been worn to the thinness of writing

<P>paper, and from a great rent in one the dead foot

<P>projected piteously.&nbsp; And it was as if fate had

<P>betrayed the soldier.&nbsp; In death it exposed to his

<P>enemies that poverty which in life he had perhaps

<P>concealed from his friends.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse.

<P>The invulnerable dead man forced a way for him-

<P>self.&nbsp; The youth looked keenly at the ashen face.

<P>The wind raised the tawny beard.&nbsp; It moved as

<P>if a hand were stroking it.&nbsp; He vaguely desired

<P>to walk around and around the body and stare;

<P>the impulse of the living to try to read in dead

<P>eyes the answer to the Question.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During the march the ardor which the youth

<P>had acquired when out of view of the field rapidly

<P>faded to nothing.&nbsp; His curiosity was quite easily

<P>satisfied.&nbsp; If an intense scene had caught him with

<P>its wild swing as he came to the top of the bank,

<P>he might have gone roaring on.&nbsp; This advance

<P>upon Nature was too calm.&nbsp; He had opportunity

<P>to reflect.&nbsp; He had time in which to wonder

<P>about himself and to attempt to probe his sensa-

<P>tions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Absurd ideas took hold upon him.&nbsp; He

<P>thought that he did not relish the landscape.

<P>It threatened him.&nbsp; A coldness swept over his

<P>back, and it is true that his trousers felt to him

<P>that they were no fit for his legs at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A house standing placidly in distant fields

<P>had to him an ominous look.&nbsp; The shadows of

<P>the woods were formidable.&nbsp; He was certain that

<P>in this vista there lurked fierce-eyed hosts.&nbsp; The

<P>swift thought came to him that the generals did

<P>not know what they were about.&nbsp; It was all a

<P>trap.&nbsp; Suddenly those close forests would bristle

<P>with rifle barrels.&nbsp; Ironlike brigades would ap-

<P>pear in the rear.&nbsp; They were all going to be

<P>sacrificed.&nbsp; The generals were stupids.&nbsp; The

<P>enemy would presently swallow the whole com-

<P>mand.&nbsp; He glared about him, expecting to see

<P>the stealthy approach of his death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He thought that he must break from the ranks

<P>and harangue his comrades.&nbsp; They must not all

<P>be killed like pigs; and he was sure it would

<P>come to pass unless they were informed of these

<P>dangers.&nbsp; The generals were idiots to send them

<P>marching into a regular pen.&nbsp; There was but one

<P>pair of eyes in the corps.&nbsp; He would step forth

<P>and make a speech.&nbsp; Shrill and passionate words

<P>came to his lips.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The line, broken into moving fragments by the

<P>ground, went calmly on through fields and woods.

<P>The youth looked at the men nearest him, and

<P>saw, for the most part, expressions of deep inter-

<P>est, as if they were investigating something that

<P>had fascinated them.&nbsp; One or two stepped with

<P>overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged

<P>into war.&nbsp; Others walked as upon thin ice.&nbsp; The

<P>greater part of the untested men appeared quiet

<P>and absorbed.&nbsp; They were going to look at war,

<P>the red animal--war, the blood-swollen god.&nbsp; And

<P>they were deeply engrossed in this march.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he looked the youth gripped his outcry at

<P>his throat.&nbsp; He saw that even if the men were

<P>tottering with fear they would laugh at his warn-

<P>ing.&nbsp; They would jeer him, and, if practicable,

<P>pelt him with missiles.&nbsp; Admitting that he might

<P>be wrong, a frenzied declamation of the kind

<P>would turn him into a worm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He assumed, then, the demeanor of one who

<P>knows that he is doomed alone to unwritten re-

<P>sponsibilities.&nbsp; He lagged, with tragic glances at

<P>the sky.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was surprised presently by the young lieu-

<P>tenant of his company, who began heartily to

<P>beat him with a sword, calling out in a loud and

<P>insolent voice: "Come, young man, get up into

<P>ranks there.&nbsp; No skulking'll do here."&nbsp; He mend-

<P>ed his pace with suitable haste.&nbsp; And he hated

<P>the lieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine

<P>minds.&nbsp; He was a mere brute.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time the brigade was halted in the

<P>cathedral light of a forest.&nbsp; The busy skirmish-

<P>ers were still popping.&nbsp; Through the aisles of

<P>the wood could be seen the floating smoke from

<P>their rifles.&nbsp; Sometimes it went up in little balls,

<P>white and compact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During this halt many men in the regiment

<P>began erecting tiny hills in front of them.&nbsp; They

<P>used stones, sticks, earth, and anything they

<P>thought might turn a bullet.&nbsp; Some built com-

<P>paratively large ones, while others seemed con-

<P>tent with little ones.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This procedure caused a discussion among the

<P>men.&nbsp; Some wished to fight like duelists, believ-

<P>ing it to be correct to stand erect and be, from

<P>their feet to their foreheads, a mark.&nbsp; They said

<P>they scorned the devices of the cautious.&nbsp; But

<P>the others scoffed in reply, and pointed to the

<P>veterans on the flanks who were digging at the

<P>ground like terriers.&nbsp; In a short time there was

<P>quite a barricade along the regimental fronts.

<P>Directly, however, they were ordered to with-

<P>draw from that place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This astounded the youth.&nbsp; He forgot his

<P>stewing over the advance movement.&nbsp; "Well,

<P>then, what did they march us out here for?" he

<P>demanded of the tall soldier.&nbsp; The latter with

<P>calm faith began a heavy explanation, although

<P>he had been compelled to leave a little protection

<P>of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much

<P>care and skill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the regiment was aligned in another

<P>position each man's regard for his safety caused

<P>another line of small intrenchments.&nbsp; They ate

<P>their noon meal behind a third one.&nbsp; They were

<P>moved from this one also.&nbsp; They were marched

<P>from place to place with apparent aimlessness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had been taught that a man be-

<P>came another thing in a battle.&nbsp; He saw his sal-

<P>vation in such a change.&nbsp; Hence this waiting

<P>was an ordeal to him.&nbsp; He was in a fever of im-

<P>patience.&nbsp; He considered that there was denoted

<P>a lack of purpose on the part of the generals.

<P>He began to complain to the tall soldier.&nbsp; "I

<P>can't stand this much longer," he cried.&nbsp; "I

<P>don't see what good it does to make us wear

<P>out our legs for nothin'."&nbsp; He wished to return

<P>to camp, knowing that this affair was a blue

<P>demonstration; or else to go into a battle and

<P>discover that he had been a fool in his doubts,

<P>and was, in truth, a man of traditional courage.

<P>The strain of present circumstances he felt to be

<P>intolerable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The philosophical tall soldier measured a sand-

<P>wich of cracker and pork and swallowed it in a

<P>nonchalant manner.&nbsp; "Oh, I suppose we must go

<P>reconnoitering around the country jest to keep

<P>'em from getting too close, or to develop 'em, or

<P>something."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Huh!" said the loud soldier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," cried the youth, still fidgeting, "I'd

<P>rather do anything 'most than go tramping 'round

<P>the country all day doing no good to nobody and

<P>jest tiring ourselves out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So would I," said the loud soldier.&nbsp; "It ain't

<P>right.&nbsp; I tell you if anybody with any sense was

<P>a-runnin' this army it--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, shut up!" roared the tall private.&nbsp; "You

<P>little fool.&nbsp; You little damn' cuss.&nbsp; You ain't had

<P>that there coat and them pants on for six months,

<P>and yet you talk as if--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I wanta do some fighting anyway,"

<P>interrupted the other.&nbsp; "I didn't come here to

<P>walk.&nbsp; I could 'ave walked to home--'round an'

<P>'round the barn, if I jest wanted to walk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall one, red-faced, swallowed another

<P>sandwich as if taking poison in despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But gradually, as he chewed, his face became

<P>again quiet and contented.&nbsp; He could not rage

<P>in fierce argument in the presence of such sand-

<P>wiches.&nbsp; During his meals he always wore an air

<P>of blissful contemplation of the food he had swal-

<P>lowed.&nbsp; His spirit seemed then to be communing

<P>with the viands.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He accepted new environment and circum-

<P>stance with great coolness, eating from his haver-

<P>sack at every opportunity.&nbsp; On the march he

<P>went along with the stride of a hunter, object-

<P>ing to neither gait nor distance.&nbsp; And he had

<P>not raised his voice when he had been ordered

<P>away from three little protective piles of earth

<P>and stone, each of which had been an engineer-

<P>ing feat worthy of being made sacred to the name

<P>of his grandmother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the afternoon the regiment went out over

<P>the same ground it had taken in the morn-

<P>ing.&nbsp; The landscape then ceased to threaten the

<P>youth.&nbsp; He had been close to it and become

<P>familiar with it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When, however, they began to pass into a

<P>new region, his old fears of stupidity and in-

<P>competence reassailed him, but this time he dog-

<P>gedly let them babble.&nbsp; He was occupied with

<P>his problem, and in his desperation he concluded

<P>that the stupidity did not greatly matter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he thought he had concluded that it

<P>would be better to get killed directly and end

<P>his troubles.&nbsp; Regarding death thus out of the

<P>corner of his eye, he conceived it to be noth-

<P>ing but rest, and he was filled with a momen-

<P>tary astonishment that he should have made an

<P>extraordinary commotion over the mere matter

<P>of getting killed.&nbsp; He would die; he would go

<P>to some place where he would be understood.

<P>It was useless to expect appreciation of his pro-

<P>found and fine senses from such men as the lieu-

<P>tenant.&nbsp; He must look to the grave for compre-

<P>hension.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The skirmish fire increased to a long chatter-

<P>ing sound.&nbsp; With it was mingled far-away cheer-

<P>ing.&nbsp; A battery spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Directly the youth would see the skirmishers

<P>running.&nbsp; They were pursued by the sound of

<P>musketry fire.&nbsp; After a time the hot, dangerous

<P>flashes of the rifles were visible.&nbsp; Smoke clouds

<P>went slowly and insolently across the fields like

<P>observant phantoms.&nbsp; The din became crescendo,

<P>like the roar of an oncoming train.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A brigade ahead of them and on the right

<P>went into action with a rending roar.&nbsp; It was

<P>as if it had exploded.&nbsp; And thereafter it lay

<P>stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall,

<P>that one was obliged to look twice at to make

<P>sure that it was smoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, forgetting his neat plan of getting

<P>killed, gazed spell bound.&nbsp; His eyes grew wide

<P>and busy with the action of the scene.&nbsp; His

<P>mouth was a little ways open.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid

<P>upon his shoulder.&nbsp; Awakening from his trance

<P>of observation he turned and beheld the loud

<P>soldier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's my first and last battle, old boy," said

<P>the latter, with intense gloom.&nbsp; He was quite

<P>pale and his girlish lip was trembling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh?" murmured the youth in great aston-

<P>ishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's my first and last battle, old boy,"

<P>continued the loud soldier.&nbsp; "Something tells

<P>me--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm a gone coon this first time and--and I

<P>w-want you to take these here things--to--my--

<P>folks."&nbsp; He ended in a quavering sob of pity for

<P>himself.&nbsp; He handed the youth a little packet

<P>done up in a yellow envelope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, what the devil--" began the youth

<P>again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
