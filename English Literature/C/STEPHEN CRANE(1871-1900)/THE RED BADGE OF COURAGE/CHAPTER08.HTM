<P>THE trees began softly to sing a hymn of twi-

<P>light.&nbsp; The sun sank until slanted bronze rays

<P>struck the forest.&nbsp; There was a lull in the noises

<P>of insects as if they had bowed their beaks and

<P>were making a devotional pause.&nbsp; There was

<P>silence save for the chanted chorus of the trees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, upon this stillness, there suddenly broke

<P>a tremendous clangor of sounds.&nbsp; A crimson roar

<P>came from the distance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth stopped.&nbsp; He was transfixed by

<P>this terrific medley of all noises.&nbsp; It was as if

<P>worlds were being rended.&nbsp; There was the rip-

<P>ping sound of musketry and the breaking crash

<P>of the artillery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His mind flew in all directions.&nbsp; He conceived

<P>the two armies to be at each other panther

<P>fashion.&nbsp; He listened for a time.&nbsp; Then he began

<P>to run in the direction of the battle.&nbsp; He saw

<P>that it was an ironical thing for him to be run-

<P>ning thus toward that which he had been at such

<P>pains to avoid.&nbsp; But he said, in substance, to him-

<P>self that if the earth and the moon were about to

<P>clash, many persons would doubtless plan to get

<P>upon the roofs to witness the collision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he ran, he became aware that the forest

<P>had stopped its music, as if at last becoming

<P>capable of hearing the foreign sounds.&nbsp; The trees

<P>hushed and stood motionless.&nbsp; Everything seemed

<P>to be listening to the crackle and clatter and ear-

<P>shaking thunder.&nbsp; The chorus pealed over the

<P>still earth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It suddenly occurred to the youth that the

<P>fight in which he had been was, after all, but

<P>perfunctory popping.&nbsp; In the hearing of this

<P>present din he was doubtful if he had seen real

<P>battle scenes.&nbsp; This uproar explained a celes-

<P>tial battle; it was tumbling hordes a-struggle in

<P>the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Reflecting, he saw a sort of a humor in the

<P>point of view of himself and his fellows during

<P>the late encounter.&nbsp; They had taken themselves

<P>and the enemy very seriously and had imagined

<P>that they were deciding the war.&nbsp; Individuals

<P>must have supposed that they were cutting the

<P>letters of their names deep into everlasting tablets

<P>of brass, or enshrining their reputations forever in

<P>the hearts of their countrymen, while, as to fact,

<P>the affair would appear in printed reports under a

<P>meek and immaterial title.&nbsp; But he saw that it was

<P>good, else, he said, in battle every one would

<P>surely run save forlorn hopes and their ilk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went rapidly on.&nbsp; He wished to come to

<P>the edge of the forest that he might peer out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he hastened, there passed through his mind

<P>pictures of stupendous conflicts.&nbsp; His accumulated

<P>thought upon such subjects was used to form

<P>scenes.&nbsp; The noise was as the voice of an eloquent

<P>being, describing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sometimes the brambles formed chains and

<P>tried to hold him back.&nbsp; Trees, confronting him,

<P>stretched out their arms and forbade him to pass.

<P>After its previous hostility this new resistance of

<P>the forest filled him with a fine bitterness.&nbsp; It

<P>seemed that Nature could not be quite ready to

<P>kill him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he obstinately took roundabout ways, and

<P>presently he was where he could see long gray

<P>walls of vapor where lay battle lines.&nbsp; The voices

<P>of cannon shook him.&nbsp; The musketry sounded in

<P>long irregular surges that played havoc with his

<P>ears.&nbsp; He stood regardant for a moment.&nbsp; His

<P>eyes had an awestruck expression.&nbsp; He gawked

<P>in the direction of the fight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently he proceeded again on his forward

<P>way.&nbsp; The battle was like the grinding of an

<P>immense and terrible machine to him.&nbsp; Its com-

<P>plexities and powers, its grim processes, fascinated

<P>him.&nbsp; He must go close and see it produce

<P>corpses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He came to a fence and clambered over it.

<P>On the far side, the ground was littered with

<P>clothes and guns.&nbsp; A newspaper, folded up, lay

<P>in the dirt.&nbsp; A dead soldier was stretched with

<P>his face hidden in his arm.&nbsp; Farther off there

<P>was a group of four or five corpses keeping

<P>mournful company.&nbsp; A hot sun had blazed upon

<P>the spot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this place the youth felt that he was an

<P>invader.&nbsp; This forgotten part of the battle ground

<P>was owned by the dead men, and he hurried, in

<P>the vague apprehension that one of the swollen

<P>forms would rise and tell him to begone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He came finally to a road from which he

<P>could see in the distance dark and agitated

<P>bodies of troops, smoke-fringed.&nbsp; In the lane

<P>was a blood-stained crowd streaming to the rear.

<P>The wounded men were cursing, groaning, and

<P>wailing.&nbsp; In the air, always, was a mighty swell

<P>of sound that it seemed could sway the earth.

<P>With the courageous words of the artillery and

<P>the spiteful sentences of the musketry mingled

<P>red cheers.&nbsp; And from this region of noises came

<P>the steady current of the maimed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One of the wounded men had a shoeful of

<P>blood.&nbsp; He hopped like a schoolboy in a game.

<P>He was laughing hysterically.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One was swearing that he had been shot in the

<P>arm through the commanding general's misman-

<P>agement of the army.&nbsp; One was marching with

<P>an air imitative of some sublime drum major.

<P>Upon his features was an unholy mixture of

<P>merriment and agony.&nbsp; As he marched he sang

<P>a bit of doggerel in a high and quavering voice:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sing a song 'a vic'try,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pocketful 'a bullets,

<P>Five an' twenty dead men

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Baked in a--pie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Parts of the procession limped and staggered to

<P>this tune.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another had the gray seal of death already

<P>upon his face.&nbsp; His lips were curled in hard lines

<P>and his teeth were clinched.&nbsp; His hands were

<P>bloody from where he had pressed them upon his

<P>wound.&nbsp; He seemed to be awaiting the moment

<P>when he should pitch headlong.&nbsp; He stalked like

<P>the specter of a soldier, his eyes burning with the

<P>power of a stare into the unknown.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were some who proceeded sullenly, full

<P>of anger at their wounds, and ready to turn upon

<P>anything as an obscure cause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An officer was carried along by two privates.

<P>He was peevish.&nbsp; "Don't joggle so, Johnson, yeh

<P>fool," he cried.&nbsp; "Think m' leg is made of iron?

<P>If yeh can't carry me decent, put me down an'

<P>let some one else do it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He bellowed at the tottering crowd who

<P>blocked the quick march of his bearers.&nbsp; "Say,

<P>make way there, can't yeh?&nbsp; Make way, dickens

<P>take it all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They sulkily parted and went to the road-

<P>sides.&nbsp; As he was carried past they made pert

<P>remarks to him.&nbsp; When he raged in reply and

<P>threatened them, they told him to be damned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The shoulder of one of the tramping bearers

<P>knocked heavily against the spectral soldier who

<P>was staring into the unknown.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth joined this crowd and marched

<P>along with it.&nbsp; The torn bodies expressed the

<P>awful machinery in which the men had been

<P>entangled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Orderlies and couriers occasionally broke

<P>through the throng in the roadway, scattering

<P>wounded men right and left, galloping on fol-

<P>lowed by howls.&nbsp; The melancholy march was

<P>continually disturbed by the messengers, and

<P>sometimes by bustling batteries that came swing-

<P>ing and thumping down upon them, the officers

<P>shouting orders to clear the way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a tattered man, fouled with dust,

<P>blood and powder stain from hair to shoes, who

<P>trudged quietly at the youth's side.&nbsp; He was lis-

<P>tening with eagerness and much humility to the

<P>lurid descriptions of a bearded sergeant.&nbsp; His

<P>lean features wore an expression of awe and ad-

<P>miration.&nbsp; He was like a listener in a country

<P>store to wondrous tales told among the sugar

<P>barrels.&nbsp; He eyed the story-teller with unspeak-

<P>able wonder.&nbsp; His mouth was agape in yokel

<P>fashion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sergeant, taking note of this, gave pause

<P>to his elaborate history while he administered a

<P>sardonic comment.&nbsp; "Be keerful, honey, you 'll

<P>be a-ketchin' flies," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tattered man shrank back abashed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time he began to sidle near to the

<P>youth, and in a different way try to make him a

<P>friend.&nbsp; His voice was gentle as a girl's voice

<P>and his eyes were pleading.&nbsp; The youth saw

<P>with surprise that the soldier had two wounds,

<P>one in the head, bound with a blood-soaked rag,

<P>and the other in the arm, making that member

<P>dangle like a broken bough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After they had walked together for some time

<P>the tattered man mustered sufficient courage to

<P>speak.&nbsp; "Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?"

<P>he timidly said.&nbsp; The youth, deep in thought,

<P>glanced up at the bloody and grim figure with

<P>its lamblike eyes.&nbsp; "What?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said the youth shortly.&nbsp; He quick-

<P>ened his pace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the other hobbled industriously after him.

<P>There was an air of apology in his manner, but

<P>he evidently thought that he needed only to talk

<P>for a time, and the youth would perceive that he

<P>was a good fellow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?" he began

<P>in a small voice, and then he achieved the forti-

<P>tude to continue.&nbsp; "Dern me if I ever see fellers

<P>fight so.&nbsp; Laws, how they did fight!&nbsp; I knowed

<P>th' boys 'd like when they onct got square at it.

<P>Th' boys ain't had no fair chanct up t' now, but

<P>this time they showed what they was.&nbsp; I knowed

<P>it 'd turn out this way.&nbsp; Yeh can't lick them boys.

<P>No, sir!&nbsp; They're fighters, they be."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He breathed a deep breath of humble ad-

<P>miration.&nbsp; He had looked at the youth for en-

<P>couragement several times.&nbsp; He received none,

<P>but gradually he seemed to get absorbed in his

<P>subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was talkin' 'cross pickets with a boy from

<P>Georgie, onct, an' that boy, he ses, 'Your fellers

<P>'ll all run like hell when they onct hearn a gun,'

<P>he ses.&nbsp; 'Mebbe they will,' I ses, 'but I don't

<P>b'lieve none of it,' I ses; 'an' b'jiminey,' I ses back

<P>t' 'um, 'mebbe your fellers 'll all run like hell

<P>when they onct hearn a gun,' I ses.&nbsp; He larfed.

<P>Well, they didn't run t' day, did they, hey?&nbsp; No,

<P>sir!&nbsp; They fit, an' fit, an' fit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His homely face was suffused with a light of

<P>love for the army which was to him all things

<P>beautiful and powerful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time he turned to the youth.&nbsp; "Where

<P>yeh hit, ol' boy?" he asked in a brotherly tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth felt instant panic at this question,

<P>although at first its full import was not borne in

<P>upon him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Where yeh hit?" repeated the tattered man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why," began the youth, "I--I--that is--

<P>why--I--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned away suddenly and slid through

<P>the crowd.&nbsp; His brow was heavily flushed, and

<P>his fingers were picking nervously at one of his

<P>buttons.&nbsp; He bent his head and fastened his eyes

<P>studiously upon the button as if it were a little

<P>problem.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tattered man looked after him in astonishment.
