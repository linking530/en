<P>THE column that had butted stoutly at the

<P>obstacles in the roadway was barely out of the

<P>youth's sight before he saw dark waves of men

<P>come sweeping out of the woods and down

<P>through the fields.&nbsp; He knew at once that the

<P>steel fibers had been washed from their hearts.

<P>They were bursting from their coats and

<P>their equipments as from entanglements.&nbsp; They

<P>charged down upon him like terrified buffaloes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Behind them blue smoke curled and clouded

<P>above the treetops, and through the thickets he

<P>could sometimes see a distant pink glare.&nbsp; The

<P>voices of the cannon were clamoring in intermi-

<P>nable chorus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth was horrorstricken.&nbsp; He stared

<P>in agony and amazement.&nbsp; He forgot that he

<P>was engaged in combating the universe.&nbsp; He

<P>threw aside his mental pamphlets on the philoso-

<P>phy of the retreated and rules for the guidance

<P>of the damned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>118
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fight was lost.&nbsp; The dragons were com-

<P>ing with invincible strides.&nbsp; The army, helpless

<P>in the matted thickets and blinded by the over-

<P>hanging night, was going to be swallowed.&nbsp; War,

<P>the red animal, war, the blood-swollen god, would

<P>have bloated fill.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Within him something bade to cry out.&nbsp; He

<P>had the impulse to make a rallying speech, to sing

<P>a battle hymn, but he could only get his tongue to

<P>call into the air: "Why--why--what--what 's

<P>th' matter?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon he was in the midst of them.&nbsp; They

<P>were leaping and scampering all about him.

<P>Their blanched faces shone in the dusk.&nbsp; They

<P>seemed, for the most part, to be very burly men.

<P>The youth turned from one to another of them as

<P>they galloped along.&nbsp; His incoherent questions

<P>were lost.&nbsp; They were heedless of his appeals.

<P>They did not seem to see him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They sometimes gabbled insanely.&nbsp; One huge

<P>man was asking of the sky: "Say, where de

<P>plank road?&nbsp; Where de plank road!"&nbsp; It was as if

<P>he had lost a child.&nbsp; He wept in his pain and

<P>dismay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently, men were running hither and

<P>thither in all ways.&nbsp; The artillery booming,

<P>forward, rearward, and on the flanks made

<P>jumble of ideas of direction.&nbsp; Landmarks had

<P>vanished into the gathered gloom.&nbsp; The youth

<P>began to imagine that he had got into the

<P>center of the tremendous quarrel, and he could

<P>perceive no way out of it.&nbsp; From the mouths of

<P>the fleeing men came a thousand wild questions,

<P>but no one made answers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, after rushing about and throwing

<P>interrogations at the heedless bands of retreating

<P>infantry, finally clutched a man by the arm.&nbsp; They

<P>swung around face to face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why--why--" stammered the youth strug-

<P>gling with his balking tongue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man screamed: "Let go me!&nbsp; Let go

<P>me!"&nbsp; His face was livid and his eyes were roll-

<P>ing uncontrolled.&nbsp; He was heaving and panting.

<P>He still grasped his rifle, perhaps having for-

<P>gotten to release his hold upon it.&nbsp; He tugged

<P>frantically, and the youth being compelled to lean

<P>forward was dragged several paces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let go me!&nbsp; Let go me!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why--why--" stuttered the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then!" bawled the man in a lurid

<P>rage.&nbsp; He adroitly and fiercely swung his rifle.

<P>It crushed upon the youth's head.&nbsp; The man

<P>ran on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth's fingers had turned to paste upon

<P>the other's arm.&nbsp; The energy was smitten from

<P>his muscles.&nbsp; He saw the flaming wings of light-

<P>ning flash before his vision.&nbsp; There was a deaf-

<P>ening rumble of thunder within his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly his legs seemed to die.&nbsp; He sank

<P>writhing to the ground.&nbsp; He tried to arise.&nbsp; In

<P>his efforts against the numbing pain he was like a

<P>man wrestling with a creature of the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a sinister struggle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sometimes he would achieve a position half

<P>erect, battle with the air for a moment, and

<P>then fall again, grabbing at the grass.&nbsp; His face

<P>was of a clammy pallor.&nbsp; Deep groans were

<P>wrenched from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last, with a twisting movement, he got

<P>upon his hands and knees, and from thence, like a

<P>babe trying to walk, to his feet.&nbsp; Pressing his

<P>hands to his temples he went lurching over the

<P>grass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He fought an intense battle with his body.

<P>His dulled senses wished him to swoon and he

<P>opposed them stubbornly, his mind portraying

<P>unknown dangers and mutilations if he should

<P>fall upon the field.&nbsp; He went tall soldier fashion.

<P>He imagined secluded spots where he could fall

<P>and be unmolested.&nbsp; To search for one he strove

<P>against the tide of his pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once he put his hand to the top of his head

<P>and timidly touched the wound.&nbsp; The scratching

<P>pain of the contact made him draw a long breath

<P>through his clinched teeth.&nbsp; His fingers were

<P>dabbled with blood.&nbsp; He regarded them with a

<P>fixed stare.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Around him he could hear the grumble of

<P>jolted cannon as the scurrying horses were lashed

<P>toward the front.&nbsp; Once, a young officer on a

<P>besplashed charger nearly ran him down.&nbsp; He

<P>turned and watched the mass of guns, men, and

<P>horses sweeping in a wide curve toward a gap in

<P>a fence.&nbsp; The officer was making excited motions

<P>with a gauntleted hand.&nbsp; The guns followed the

<P>teams with an air of unwillingness, of being

<P>dragged by the heels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some officers of the scattered infantry were

<P>cursing and railing like fishwives.&nbsp; Their scold-

<P>ing voices could be heard above the din.&nbsp; Into

<P>the unspeakable jumble in the roadway rode a

<P>squadron of cavalry.&nbsp; The faded yellow of their

<P>facings shone bravely.&nbsp; There was a mighty

<P>altercation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The artillery were assembling as if for a con-

<P>ference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The blue haze of evening was upon the field.

<P>The lines of forest were long purple shadows.

<P>One cloud lay along the western sky partly

<P>smothering the red.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the youth left the scene behind him, he

<P>heard the guns suddenly roar out.&nbsp; He imagined

<P>them shaking in black rage.&nbsp; They belched and

<P>howled like brass devils guarding a gate.&nbsp; The

<P>soft air was filled with the tremendous remon-

<P>strance.&nbsp; With it came the shattering peal of

<P>opposing infantry.&nbsp; Turning to look behind him,

<P>he could see sheets of orange light illumine the

<P>shadowy distance.&nbsp; There were subtle and sudden

<P>lightnings in the far air.&nbsp; At times he thought he

<P>could see heaving masses of men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He hurried on in the dusk.&nbsp; The day had

<P>faded until he could barely distinguish place for

<P>his feet.&nbsp; The purple darkness was filled with

<P>men who lectured and jabbered.&nbsp; Sometimes he

<P>could see them gesticulating against the blue and

<P>somber sky.&nbsp; There seemed to be a great ruck of

<P>men and munitions spread about in the forest and

<P>in the fields.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little narrow roadway now lay lifeless.

<P>There were overturned wagons like sun-dried

<P>bowlders.&nbsp; The bed of the former torrent was

<P>choked with the bodies of horses and splintered

<P>parts of war machines.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It had come to pass that his wound pained him

<P>but little.&nbsp; He was afraid to move rapidly, how-

<P>ever, for a dread of disturbing it.&nbsp; He held his

<P>head very still and took many precautions against

<P>stumbling.&nbsp; He was filled with anxiety, and his

<P>face was pinched and drawn in anticipation of the

<P>pain of any sudden mistake of his feet in the

<P>gloom.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His thoughts, as he walked, fixed intently

<P>upon his hurt.&nbsp; There was a cool, liquid feeling

<P>about it and he imagined blood moving slowly

<P>down under his hair.&nbsp; His head seemed swollen

<P>to a size that made him think his neck to be

<P>inadequate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The new silence of his wound made much

<P>worriment.&nbsp; The little blistering voices of pain

<P>that had called out from his scalp were, he

<P>thought, definite in their expression of danger.

<P>By them he believed that he could measure his

<P>plight.&nbsp; But when they remained ominously

<P>silent he became frightened and imagined ter-

<P>rible fingers that clutched into his brain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amid it he began to reflect upon various

<P>incidents and conditions of the past.&nbsp; He be-

<P>thought him of certain meals his mother had

<P>cooked at home, in which those dishes of which

<P>he was particularly fond had occupied prominent

<P>positions.&nbsp; He saw the spread table.&nbsp; The pine

<P>walls of the kitchen were glowing in the warm

<P>light from the stove.&nbsp; Too, he remembered how

<P>he and his companions used to go from the school-

<P>house to the bank of a shaded pool.&nbsp; He saw his

<P>clothes in disorderly array upon the grass of the

<P>bank.&nbsp; He felt the swash of the fragrant water

<P>upon his body.&nbsp; The leaves of the overhanging

<P>maple rustled with melody in the wind of youth-

<P>ful summer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was overcome presently by a dragging

<P>weariness.&nbsp; His head hung forward and his

<P>shoulders were stooped as if he were bearing a

<P>great bundle.&nbsp; His feet shuffled along the

<P>ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He held continuous arguments as to whether

<P>he should lie down and sleep at some near spot,

<P>or force himself on until he reached a certain

<P>haven.&nbsp; He often tried to dismiss the question,

<P>but his body persisted in rebellion and his senses

<P>nagged at him like pampered babies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last he heard a cheery voice near his

<P>shoulder: "Yeh seem t' be in a pretty bad way,

<P>boy?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth did not look up, but he assented

<P>with thick tongue.&nbsp; "Uh!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The owner of the cheery voice took him firmly

<P>by the arm.&nbsp; "Well," he said, with a round

<P>laugh, "I'm goin' your way.&nbsp; Th' hull gang is

<P>goin' your way.&nbsp; An' I guess I kin give yeh a

<P>lift."&nbsp; They began to walk like a drunken man

<P>and his friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they went along, the man questioned the

<P>youth and assisted him with the replies like one

<P>manipulating the mind of a child.&nbsp; Sometimes he

<P>interjected anecdotes.&nbsp; "What reg'ment do yeh

<P>b'long teh?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp; Th' 304th N'

<P>York?&nbsp; Why, what corps is that in?&nbsp; Oh, it is?

<P>Why, I thought they wasn't engaged t'-day--

<P>they 're 'way over in th' center.&nbsp; Oh, they was,

<P>eh?&nbsp; Well, pretty nearly everybody got their

<P>share 'a fightin' t'-day.&nbsp; By dad, I give myself up

<P>fer dead any number 'a times.&nbsp; There was shootin'

<P>here an' shootin' there, an' hollerin' here an'

<P>hollerin' there, in th' damn' darkness, until I

<P>couldn't tell t' save m' soul which side I was on.

<P>Sometimes I thought I was sure 'nough from

<P>Ohier, an' other times I could 'a swore I was

<P>from th' bitter end of Florida.&nbsp; It was th' most

<P>mixed up dern thing I ever see.&nbsp; An' these here

<P>hull woods is a reg'lar mess.&nbsp; It'll be a miracle

<P>if we find our reg'ments t'-night.&nbsp; Pretty soon,

<P>though, we 'll meet a-plenty of guards an' provost-

<P>guards, an' one thing an' another.&nbsp; Ho! there they

<P>go with an off'cer, I guess.&nbsp; Look at his hand

<P>a-draggin'.&nbsp; He 's got all th' war he wants, I bet.

<P>He won't be talkin' so big about his reputation

<P>an' all when they go t' sawin' off his leg.&nbsp; Poor

<P>feller!&nbsp; My brother 's got whiskers jest like that.

<P>How did yeh git 'way over here, anyhow?&nbsp; Your

<P>reg'ment is a long way from here, ain't it?&nbsp; Well,

<P>I guess we can find it.&nbsp; Yeh know there was a

<P>boy killed in my comp'ny t'-day that I thought

<P>th' world an' all of.&nbsp; Jack was a nice feller.&nbsp; By

<P>ginger, it hurt like thunder t' see ol' Jack jest git

<P>knocked flat.&nbsp; We was a-standin' purty peaceable

<P>fer a spell, 'though there was men runnin' ev'ry

<P>way all 'round us, an' while we was a-standin'

<P>like that, 'long come a big fat feller.&nbsp; He began

<P>t' peck at Jack's elbow, an' he ses: 'Say, where 's

<P>th' road t' th' river?'&nbsp; An' Jack, he never paid no

<P>attention, an' th' feller kept on a-peckin' at his

<P>elbow an' sayin': 'Say, where 's th' road t' th'

<P>river?'&nbsp; Jack was a-lookin' ahead all th' time

<P>tryin' t' see th' Johnnies comin' through th'

<P>woods, an' he never paid no attention t' this big

<P>fat feller fer a long time, but at last he turned

<P>'round an' he ses: 'Ah, go t' hell an' find th'

<P>road t' th' river!'&nbsp; An' jest then a shot slapped

<P>him bang on th' side th' head.&nbsp; He was a sergeant,

<P>too.&nbsp; Them was his last words.&nbsp; Thunder, I wish

<P>we was sure 'a findin' our reg'ments t'-night.&nbsp; It 's

<P>goin' t' be long huntin'.&nbsp; But I guess we kin

<P>do it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the search which followed, the man of the

<P>cheery voice seemed to the youth to possess a

<P>wand of a magic kind.&nbsp; He threaded the mazes

<P>of the tangled forest with a strange fortune.&nbsp; In

<P>encounters with guards and patrols he displayed

<P>the keenness of a detective and the valor of a

<P>gamin.&nbsp; Obstacles fell before him and became of

<P>assistance.&nbsp; The youth, with his chin still on his

<P>breast, stood woodenly by while his companion

<P>beat ways and means out of sullen things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The forest seemed a vast hive of men buzzing

<P>about in frantic circles, but the cheery man con-

<P>ducted the youth without mistakes, until at last

<P>he began to chuckle with glee and self-satisfaction.

<P>"Ah, there yeh are!&nbsp; See that fire?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth nodded stupidly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, there 's where your reg'ment is.&nbsp; An'

<P>now, good-by, ol' boy, good luck t' yeh."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A warm and strong hand clasped the youth's

<P>languid fingers for an instant, and then he heard

<P>a cheerful and audacious whistling as the man

<P>strode away.&nbsp; As he who had so befriended him

<P>was thus passing out of his life, it suddenly oc-

<P>curred to the youth that he had not once seen his

<P>face.
