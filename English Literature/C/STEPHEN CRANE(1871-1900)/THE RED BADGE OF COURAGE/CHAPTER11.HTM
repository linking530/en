<P>HE became aware that the furnace roar of the

<P>battle was growing louder.&nbsp; Great brown clouds

<P>had floated to the still heights of air before him.

<P>The noise, too, was approaching.&nbsp; The woods

<P>filtered men and the fields became dotted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he rounded a hillock, he perceived that the

<P>roadway was now a crying mass of wagons,

<P>teams, and men.&nbsp; From the heaving tangle issued

<P>exhortations, commands, imprecations.&nbsp; Fear was

<P>sweeping it all along.&nbsp; The cracking whips bit

<P>and horses plunged and tugged.&nbsp; The white-

<P>topped wagons strained and stumbled in their

<P>exertions like fat sheep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth felt comforted in a measure by this

<P>sight.&nbsp; They were all retreating.&nbsp; Perhaps, then,

<P>he was not so bad after all.&nbsp; He seated himself

<P>and watched the terror-stricken wagons.&nbsp; They

<P>fled like soft, ungainly animals.&nbsp; All the roarers

<P>and lashers served to help him to magnify the

<P>dangers and horrors of the engagement that he

<P>might try to prove to himself that the thing with

<P>which men could charge him was in truth a

<P>symmetrical act.&nbsp; There was an amount of pleas-

<P>ure to him in watching the wild march of this

<P>vindication.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently the calm head of a forward-going

<P>column of infantry appeared in the road.&nbsp; It

<P>came swiftly on.&nbsp; Avoiding the obstructions gave

<P>it the sinuous movement of a serpent.&nbsp; The men

<P>at the head butted mules with their musket

<P>stocks.&nbsp; They prodded teamsters indifferent to

<P>all howls.&nbsp; The men forced their way through

<P>parts of the dense mass by strength.&nbsp; The blunt

<P>head of the column pushed.&nbsp; The raving team-

<P>sters swore many strange oaths.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The commands to make way had the ring of a

<P>great importance in them.&nbsp; The men were going

<P>forward to the heart of the din.&nbsp; They were to

<P>confront the eager rush of the enemy.&nbsp; They felt

<P>the pride of their onward movement when the

<P>remainder of the army seemed trying to dribble

<P>down this road.&nbsp; They tumbled teams about

<P>with a fine feeling that it was no matter so long

<P>as their column got to the front in time.&nbsp; This

<P>importance made their faces grave and stern.

<P>And the backs of the officers were very rigid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the youth looked at them the black weight

<P>of his woe returned to him.&nbsp; He felt that he was

<P>regarding a procession of chosen beings.&nbsp; The

<P>separation was as great to him as if they had

<P>marched with weapons of flame and banners of

<P>sunlight.&nbsp; He could never be like them.&nbsp; He

<P>could have wept in his longings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He searched about in his mind for an ade-

<P>quate malediction for the indefinite cause, the

<P>thing upon which men turn the words of final

<P>blame.&nbsp; It--whatever it was--was responsible for

<P>him, he said.&nbsp; There lay the fault.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The haste of the column to reach the battle

<P>seemed to the forlorn young man to be some-

<P>thing much finer than stout fighting.&nbsp; Heroes, he

<P>thought, could find excuses in that long seething

<P>lane.&nbsp; They could retire with perfect self-respect

<P>and make excuses to the stars.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He wondered what those men had eaten that

<P>they could be in such haste to force their way to

<P>grim chances of death.&nbsp; As he watched his envy

<P>grew until he thought that he wished to change

<P>lives with one of them.&nbsp; He would have liked to

<P>have used a tremendous force, he said, throw off

<P>himself and become a better.&nbsp; Swift pictures of

<P>himself, apart, yet in himself, came to him--a

<P>blue desperate figure leading lurid charges with

<P>one knee forward and a broken blade high--a

<P>blue, determined figure standing before a crimson

<P>and steel assault, getting calmly killed on a high

<P>place before the eyes of all.&nbsp; He thought of the

<P>magnificent pathos of his dead body.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These thoughts uplifted him.&nbsp; He felt the

<P>quiver of war desire.&nbsp; In his ears, he heard the

<P>ring of victory.&nbsp; He knew the frenzy of a rapid

<P>successful charge.&nbsp; The music of the trampling

<P>feet, the sharp voices, the clanking arms of the

<P>column near him made him soar on the red wings

<P>of war.&nbsp; For a few moments he was sublime.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He thought that he was about to start for the

<P>front.&nbsp; Indeed, he saw a picture of himself, dust-

<P>stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front at

<P>the proper moment to seize and throttle the dark,

<P>leering witch of calamity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then the difficulties of the thing began to

<P>drag at him.&nbsp; He hesitated, balancing awkwardly

<P>on one foot.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had no rifle; he could not fight with his

<P>hands, said he resentfully to his plan.&nbsp; Well,

<P>rifles could be had for the picking.&nbsp; They were

<P>extraordinarily profuse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Also, he continued, it would be a miracle if he

<P>found his regiment.&nbsp; Well, he could fight with

<P>any regiment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He started forward slowly.&nbsp; He stepped as if

<P>he expected to tread upon some explosive thing.

<P>Doubts and he were struggling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He would truly be a worm if any of his com-

<P>rades should see him returning thus, the marks of

<P>his flight upon him.&nbsp; There was a reply that the

<P>intent fighters did not care for what happened

<P>rearward saving that no hostile bayonets ap-

<P>peared there.&nbsp; In the battle-blur his face would,

<P>in a way be hidden, like the face of a cowled

<P>man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But then he said that his tireless fate would

<P>bring forth, when the strife lulled for a moment,

<P>a man to ask of him an explanation.&nbsp; In imagina-

<P>tion he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he

<P>painfully labored through some lies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Eventually, his courage expended itself upon

<P>these objections.&nbsp; The debates drained him of his

<P>fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was not cast down by this defeat of his

<P>plan, for, upon studying the affair carefully, he

<P>could not but admit that the objections were very

<P>formidable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Furthermore, various ailments had begun to

<P>cry out.&nbsp; In their presence he could not persist

<P>in flying high with the wings of war; they

<P>rendered it almost impossible for him to see him-

<P>self in a heroic light.&nbsp; He tumbled headlong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He discovered that he had a scorching thirst.

<P>His face was so dry and grimy that he thought

<P>he could feel his skin crackle.&nbsp; Each bone of his

<P>body had an ache in it, and seemingly threatened

<P>to break with each movement.&nbsp; His feet were

<P>like two sores.&nbsp; Also, his body was calling for

<P>food.&nbsp; It was more powerful than a direct hunger.

<P>There was a dull, weight like feeling in his stom-

<P>ach, and, when he tried to walk, his head swayed

<P>and he tottered.&nbsp; He could not see with distinct-

<P>ness.&nbsp; Small patches of green mist floated before

<P>his vision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While he had been tossed by many emotions,

<P>he had not been aware of ailments.&nbsp; Now they

<P>beset him and made clamor.&nbsp; As he was at last

<P>compelled to pay attention to them, his capacity

<P>for self-hate was multiplied.&nbsp; In despair, he

<P>declared that he was not like those others.&nbsp; He

<P>now conceded it to be impossible that he should

<P>ever become a hero.&nbsp; He was a craven loon.

<P>Those pictures of glory were piteous things.&nbsp; He

<P>groaned from his heart and went staggering off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A certain mothlike quality within him kept

<P>him in the vicinity of the battle.&nbsp; He had a great

<P>desire to see, and to get news.&nbsp; He wished to

<P>know who was winning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He told himself that, despite his unprecedented

<P>suffering, he had never lost his greed for a victory,

<P>yet, he said, in a half-apologetic manner to his

<P>conscience, he could not but know that a defeat

<P>for the army this time might mean many favor-

<P>able things for him.&nbsp; The blows of the enemy

<P>would splinter regiments into fragments.&nbsp; Thus,

<P>many men of courage, he considered, would be

<P>obliged to desert the colors and scurry like

<P>chickens.&nbsp; He would appear as one of them.

<P>They would be sullen brothers in distress, and he

<P>could then easily believe he had not run any

<P>farther or faster than they.&nbsp; And if he himself

<P>could believe in his virtuous perfection, he con-

<P>ceived that there would be small trouble in con-

<P>vincing all others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He said, as if in excuse for this hope, that

<P>previously the army had encountered great

<P>defeats and in a few months had shaken off all

<P>blood and tradition of them, emerging as bright

<P>and valiant as a new one; thrusting out of sight

<P>the memory of disaster, and appearing with the

<P>valor and confidence of unconquered legions.

<P>The shrilling voices of the people at home would

<P>pipe dismally for a time, but various generals

<P>were usually compelled to listen to these ditties.

<P>He of course felt no compunctions for proposing

<P>a general as a sacrifice.&nbsp; He could not tell who

<P>the chosen for the barbs might be, so he could

<P>center no direct sympathy upon him.&nbsp; The

<P>people were afar and he did not conceive public

<P>opinion to be accurate at long range.&nbsp; It was

<P>quite probable they would hit the wrong man

<P>who, after he had recovered from his amazement

<P>would perhaps spend the rest of his days in writ-

<P>ing replies to the songs of his alleged failure.&nbsp; It

<P>would be very unfortunate, no doubt, but in this

<P>case a general was of no consequence to the

<P>youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a defeat there would be a roundabout

<P>vindication of himself.&nbsp; He thought it would

<P>prove, in a manner, that he had fled early because

<P>of his superior powers of perception.&nbsp; A serious

<P>prophet upon predicting a flood should be the

<P>first man to climb a tree.&nbsp; This would demon-

<P>strate that he was indeed a seer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A moral vindication was regarded by the

<P>youth as a very important thing.&nbsp; Without salve,

<P>he could not, he thought, wear the sore badge of

<P>his dishonor through life.&nbsp; With his heart con-

<P>tinually assuring him that he was despicable, he

<P>could not exist without making it, through his

<P>actions, apparent to all men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If the army had gone gloriously on he would

<P>be lost.&nbsp; If the din meant that now his army's

<P>flags were tilted forward he was a condemned

<P>wretch.&nbsp; He would be compelled to doom

<P>himself to isolation.&nbsp; If the men were advancing,

<P>their indifferent feet were trampling upon his

<P>chances for a successful life.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As these thoughts went rapidly through his

<P>mind, he turned upon them and tried to thrust

<P>them away.&nbsp; He denounced himself as a villain.

<P>He said that he was the most unutterably selfish

<P>man in existence.&nbsp; His mind pictured the soldiers

<P>who would place their defiant bodies before the

<P>spear of the yelling battle fiend, and as he saw

<P>their dripping corpses on an imagined field, he

<P>said that he was their murderer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again he thought that he wished he was dead.

<P>He believed that he envied a corpse.&nbsp; Thinking

<P>of the slain, he achieved a great contempt for

<P>some of them, as if they were guilty for thus

<P>becoming lifeless.&nbsp; They might have been killed

<P>by lucky chances, he said, before they had had

<P>opportunities to flee or before they had been

<P>really tested.&nbsp; Yet they would receive laurels

<P>from tradition.&nbsp; He cried out bitterly that their

<P>crowns were stolen and their robes of glori-

<P>ous memories were shams.&nbsp; However, he still

<P>said that it was a great pity he was not as

<P>they.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A defeat of the army had suggested itself to

<P>him as a means of escape from the consequences

<P>of his fall.&nbsp; He considered, now, however, that it

<P>was useless to think of such a possibility.&nbsp; His

<P>education had been that success for that mighty

<P>blue machine was certain; that it would make

<P>victories as a contrivance turns out buttons.&nbsp; He

<P>presently discarded all his speculations in the

<P>other direction.&nbsp; He returned to the creed of

<P>soldiers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he perceived again that it was not

<P>possible for the army to be defeated, he tried

<P>to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take

<P>back to his regiment, and with it turn the expected

<P>shafts of derision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But, as he mortally feared these shafts, it

<P>became impossible for him to invent a tale he felt

<P>he could trust.&nbsp; He experimented with many

<P>schemes, but threw them aside one by one as

<P>flimsy.&nbsp; He was quick to see vulnerable places in

<P>them all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Furthermore, he was much afraid that some

<P>arrow of scorn might lay him mentally low before

<P>he could raise his protecting tale.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He imagined the whole regiment saying:

<P>"Where's Henry Fleming?&nbsp; He run, didn't 'e?

<P>Oh, my!"&nbsp; He recalled various persons who

<P>would be quite sure to leave him no peace

<P>about it.&nbsp; They would doubtless question him

<P>with sneers, and laugh at his stammering hesi-

<P>tation.&nbsp; In the next engagement they would

<P>try to keep watch of him to discover when he

<P>would run.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wherever he went in camp, he would en-

<P>counter insolent and lingeringly cruel stares.&nbsp; As

<P>he imagined himself passing near a crowd of

<P>comrades, he could hear some one say, "There

<P>he goes!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then, as if the heads were moved by one

<P>muscle, all the faces were turned toward him

<P>with wide, derisive grins.&nbsp; He seemed to hear

<P>some one make a humorous remark in a low tone.

<P>At it the others all crowed and cackled.&nbsp; He was

<P>a slang phrase.
