<P>THE brigade was halted in the fringe of a

<P>grove.&nbsp; The men crouched among the trees and

<P>pointed their restless guns out at the fields.

<P>They tried to look beyond the smoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Out of this haze they could see running men.

<P>Some shouted information and gestured as they

<P>hurried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The men of the new regiment watched and

<P>listened eagerly, while their tongues ran on in

<P>gossip of the battle.&nbsp; They mouthed rumors that

<P>had flown like birds out of the unknown.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They say Perry has been driven in with big

<P>loss."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Carrott went t' th' hospital.&nbsp; He said he

<P>was sick.&nbsp; That smart lieutenant is commanding

<P>'G' Company.&nbsp; Th' boys say they won't be

<P>under Carrott no more if they all have t' desert.

<P>They allus knew he was a--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hannises' batt'ry is took."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It ain't either.&nbsp; I saw Hannises' batt'ry off on

<P>th' left not more'n fifteen minutes ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>47
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Th' general, he ses he is goin' t' take th' hull

<P>cammand of th' 304th when we go inteh action,

<P>an' then he ses we'll do sech fightin' as never

<P>another one reg'ment done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They say we're catchin' it over on th' left.

<P>They say th' enemy driv' our line inteh a devil of

<P>a swamp an' took Hannises' batt'ry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No sech thing.&nbsp; Hannises' batt'ry was 'long

<P>here 'bout a minute ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That young Hasbrouck, he makes a good

<P>off'cer.&nbsp; He ain't afraid 'a nothin'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I met one of th' 148th Maine boys an' he ses

<P>his brigade fit th' hull rebel army fer four hours

<P>over on th' turnpike road an' killed about five

<P>thousand of 'em.&nbsp; He ses one more sech fight as

<P>that an' th' war 'll be over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bill wasn't scared either.&nbsp; No, sir!&nbsp; It wasn't

<P>that.&nbsp; Bill ain't a-gittin' scared easy.&nbsp; He was

<P>jest mad, that's what he was.&nbsp; When that feller

<P>trod on his hand, he up an' sed that he was willin'

<P>t' give his hand t' his country, but he be dumbed

<P>if he was goin' t' have every dumb bushwhacker

<P>in th' kentry walkin' 'round on it.&nbsp; Se he went t'

<P>th' hospital disregardless of th' fight.&nbsp; Three

<P>fingers was crunched.&nbsp; Th' dern doctor wanted

<P>t' amputate 'm, an' Bill, he raised a heluva row, I

<P>hear.&nbsp; He's a funny feller."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The din in front swelled to a tremendous

<P>chorus.&nbsp; The youth and his fellows were frozen

<P>to silence.&nbsp; They could see a flag that tossed in

<P>the smoke angrily.&nbsp; Near it were the blurred and

<P>agitated forms of troops.&nbsp; There came a turbulent

<P>stream of men across the fields.&nbsp; A battery chang-

<P>ing position at a frantic gallop scattered the

<P>stragglers right and left.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A shell screaming like a storm banshee went

<P>over the huddled heads of the reserves.&nbsp; It landed

<P>in the grove, and exploding redly flung the brown

<P>earth.&nbsp; There was a little shower of pine needles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Bullets began to whistle among the branches

<P>and nip at the trees.&nbsp; Twigs and leaves came

<P>sailing down.&nbsp; It was as if a thousand axes, wee

<P>and invisible, were being wielded.&nbsp; Many of the

<P>men were constantly dodging and ducking their

<P>heads.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant of the youth's company was

<P>shot in the hand.&nbsp; He began to swear so won-

<P>drously that a nervous laugh went along the regi-

<P>mental line.&nbsp; The officer's profanity sounded

<P>conventional.&nbsp; It relieved the tightened senses of

<P>the new men.&nbsp; It was as if he had hit his fingers

<P>with a tack hammer at home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He held the wounded member carefully away

<P>from his side so that the blood would not drip

<P>upon his trousers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The captain of the company, tucking his sword

<P>under his arm, produced a handkerchief and

<P>began to bind with it the lieutenant's wound.

<P>And they disputed as to how the binding should

<P>be done.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The battle flag in the distance jerked about

<P>madly.&nbsp; It seemed to be struggling to free itself

<P>from an agony.&nbsp; The billowing smoke was filled

<P>with horizontal flashes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Men running swiftly emerged from it.&nbsp; They

<P>grew in numbers until it was seen that the whole

<P>command was fleeing.&nbsp; The flag suddenly sank

<P>down as if dying.&nbsp; Its motion as it fell was a

<P>gesture of despair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wild yells came from behind the walls of

<P>smoke.&nbsp; A sketch in gray and red dissolved into

<P>a moblike body of men who galloped like wild

<P>horses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The veteran regiments on the right and left of

<P>the 304th immediately began to jeer.&nbsp; With the

<P>passionate song of the bullets and the banshee

<P>shrieks of shells were mingled loud catcalls and

<P>bits of facetious advice concerning places of safety.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the new regiment was breathless with hor-

<P>ror.&nbsp; "Gawd!&nbsp; Saunders's got crushed!" whis-

<P>pered the man at the youth's elbow.&nbsp; They

<P>shrank back and crouched as if compelled to

<P>await a flood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth shot a swift glance along the blue

<P>ranks of the regiment.&nbsp; The profiles were motion-

<P>less, carven; and afterward he remembered that

<P>the color sergeant was standing with his legs

<P>apart, as if he expected to be pushed to the

<P>ground.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The following throng went whirling around

<P>the flank.&nbsp; Here and there were officers carried

<P>along on the stream like exasperated chips.&nbsp; They

<P>were striking about them with their swords

<P>and with their left fists, punching every head

<P>they could reach.&nbsp; They cursed like highway-

<P>men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A mounted officer displayed the furious anger

<P>of a spoiled child.&nbsp; He raged with his head, his

<P>arms, and his legs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another, the commander of the brigade, was

<P>galloping about bawling.&nbsp; His hat was gone and

<P>his clothes were awry.&nbsp; He resembled a man

<P>who has come from bed to go to a fire.&nbsp; The

<P>hoofs of his horse often threatened the heads of

<P>the running men, but they scampered with sin-

<P>gular fortune.&nbsp; In this rush they were apparently

<P>all deaf and blind.&nbsp; They heeded not the largest

<P>and longest of the oaths that were thrown at

<P>them from all directions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Frequently over this tumult could be heard

<P>the grim jokes of the critical veterans; but the

<P>retreating men apparently were not even con-

<P>scious of the presence of an audience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The battle reflection that shone for an instant

<P>in the faces on the mad current made the youth

<P>feel that forceful hands from heaven would not

<P>have been able to have held him in place if he

<P>could have got intelligent control of his legs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was an appalling imprint upon these

<P>faces.&nbsp; The struggle in the smoke had pictured

<P>an exaggeration of itself on the bleached cheeks

<P>and in the eyes wild with one desire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sight of this stampede exerted a floodlike

<P>force that seemed able to drag sticks and stones

<P>and men from the ground.&nbsp; They of the reserves

<P>had to hold on.&nbsp; They grew pale and firm, and

<P>red and quaking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth achieved one little thought in the

<P>midst of this chaos.&nbsp; The composite monster

<P>which had caused the other troops to flee had

<P>not then appeared.&nbsp; He resolved to get a view

<P>of it, and then, he thought he might very likely

<P>run better than the best of them.
