<P>THE roarings that had stretched in a long line

<P>of sound across the face of the forest began to

<P>grow intermittent and weaker.&nbsp; The stentorian

<P>speeches of the artillery continued in some dis-

<P>tant encounter, but the crashes of the musketry

<P>had almost ceased.&nbsp; The youth and his friend of

<P>a sudden looked up, feeling a deadened form of

<P>distress at the waning of these noises, which had

<P>become a part of life.&nbsp; They could see changes

<P>going on among the troops.&nbsp; There were march-

<P>ings this way and that way.&nbsp; A battery wheeled

<P>leisurely.&nbsp; On the crest of a small hill was the

<P>thick gleam of many departing muskets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth arose.&nbsp; "Well, what now, I won-

<P>der?" he said.&nbsp; By his tone he seemed to be

<P>preparing to resent some new monstrosity in

<P>the way of dins and smashes.&nbsp; He shaded his

<P>eyes with his grimy hand and gazed over the

<P>field.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend also arose and stared.&nbsp; "I bet
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>226

<P>we're goin' t' git along out of this an' back over

<P>th' river," said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I swan!" said the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They waited, watching.&nbsp; Within a little while

<P>the regiment received orders to retrace its way.

<P>The men got up grunting from the grass, regret-

<P>ting the soft repose.&nbsp; They jerked their stiffened

<P>legs, and stretched their arms over their heads.

<P>One man swore as he rubbed his eyes.&nbsp; They all

<P>groaned "O Lord!"&nbsp; They had as many objec-

<P>tions to this change as they would have had to a

<P>proposal for a new battle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They trampled slowly back over the field

<P>across which they had run in a mad scamper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The regiment marched until it had joined its

<P>fellows.&nbsp; The reformed brigade, in column, aimed

<P>through a wood at the road.&nbsp; Directly they were

<P>in a mass of dust-covered troops, and were

<P>trudging along in a way parallel to the enemy's

<P>lines as these had been defined by the previous

<P>turmoil.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They passed within view of a stolid white

<P>house, and saw in front of it groups of their com-

<P>rades lying in wait behind a neat breastwork.&nbsp; A

<P>row of guns were booming at a distant enemy.

<P>Shells thrown in reply were raising clouds of

<P>dust and splinters.&nbsp; Horsemen dashed along the

<P>line of intrenchments.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this point of its march the division curved

<P>away from the field and went winding off in the

<P>direction of the river.&nbsp; When the significance of

<P>this movement had impressed itself upon the

<P>youth he turned his head and looked over his

<P>shoulder toward the trampled and debris-strewed

<P>ground.&nbsp; He breathed a breath of new satisfac-

<P>tion.&nbsp; He finally nudged his friend.&nbsp; "Well, it's

<P>all over," he said to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend gazed backward.&nbsp; "B'Gawd, it

<P>is," he assented.&nbsp; They mused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a time the youth was obliged to reflect

<P>in a puzzled and uncertain way.&nbsp; His mind was

<P>undergoing a subtle change.&nbsp; It took moments

<P>for it to cast off its battleful ways and resume

<P>its accustomed course of thought.&nbsp; Gradually his

<P>brain emerged from the clogged clouds, and at

<P>last he was enabled to more closely compre-

<P>hend himself and circumstance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He understood then that the existence of shot

<P>and counter-shot was in the past.&nbsp; He had dwelt

<P>in a land of strange, squalling upheavals and had

<P>come forth.&nbsp; He had been where there was red

<P>of blood and black of passion, and he was es-

<P>caped.&nbsp; His first thoughts were given to rejoic-

<P>ings at this fact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Later he began to study his deeds, his fail-

<P>ures, and his achievements.&nbsp; Thus, fresh from

<P>scenes where many of his usual machines of re-

<P>flection had been idle, from where he had pro-

<P>ceeded sheeplike, he struggled to marshal all his

<P>acts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last they marched before him clearly.

<P>From this present view point he was enabled

<P>to look upon them in spectator fashion and

<P>to criticise them with some correctness, for his

<P>new condition had already defeated certain sym-

<P>pathies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Regarding his procession of memory he felt

<P>gleeful and unregretting, for in it his public deeds

<P>were paraded in great and shining prominence.

<P>Those performances which had been witnessed

<P>by his fellows marched now in wide purple and

<P>gold, having various deflections.&nbsp; They went

<P>gayly with music.&nbsp; It was pleasure to watch these

<P>things.&nbsp; He spent delightful minutes viewing the

<P>gilded images of memory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He saw that he was good.&nbsp; He recalled with

<P>a thrill of joy the respectful comments of his fel-

<P>lows upon his conduct.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nevertheless, the ghost of his flight from

<P>the first engagement appeared to him and

<P>danced.&nbsp; There were small shoutings in his

<P>brain about these matters.&nbsp; For a moment he

<P>blushed, and the light of his soul flickered with

<P>shame.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A specter of reproach came to him.&nbsp; There

<P>loomed the dogging memory of the tattered

<P>soldier--he who, gored by bullets and faint for

<P>blood, had fretted concerning an imagined wound

<P>in another; he who had loaned his last of strength

<P>and intellect for the tall soldier; he who, blind

<P>with weariness and pain, had been deserted in

<P>the field.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For an instant a wretched chill of sweat was

<P>upon him at the thought that he might be

<P>detected in the thing.&nbsp; As he stood persistently

<P>before his vision, he gave vent to a cry of sharp

<P>irritation and agony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend turned.&nbsp; "What's the matter,

<P>Henry?" he demanded.&nbsp; The youth's reply was

<P>an outburst of crimson oaths.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he marched along the little branch-hung

<P>roadway among his prattling companions this

<P>vision of cruelty brooded over him.&nbsp; It clung

<P>near him always and darkened his view of these

<P>deeds in purple and gold.&nbsp; Whichever way his

<P>thoughts turned they were followed by the

<P>somber phantom of the desertion in the fields.

<P>He looked stealthily at his companions, feeling

<P>sure that they must discern in his face evidences

<P>of this pursuit.&nbsp; But they were plodding in

<P>ragged array, discussing with quick tongues the

<P>accomplishments of the late battle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, if a man should come up an' ask me, I'd

<P>say we got a dum good lickin'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lickin'--in yer eye!&nbsp; We ain't licked, sonny.

<P>We're goin' down here aways, swing aroun', an'

<P>come in behint 'em."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, hush, with your comin' in behint 'em.

<P>I've seen all 'a that I wanta.&nbsp; Don't tell me about

<P>comin' in behint--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Bill Smithers, he ses he'd rather been in

<P>ten hundred battles than been in that heluva

<P>hospital.&nbsp; He ses they got shootin' in th' night-

<P>time, an' shells dropped plum among 'em in th'

<P>hospital.&nbsp; He ses sech hollerin' he never see."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hasbrouck?&nbsp; He's th' best off'cer in this

<P>here reg'ment.&nbsp; He's a whale."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't I tell yeh we'd come aroun' in behint

<P>'em?&nbsp; Didn't I tell yeh so?&nbsp; We--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, shet yeh mouth!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a time this pursuing recollection of the

<P>tattered man took all elation from the youth's

<P>veins.&nbsp; He saw his vivid error, and he was afraid

<P>that it would stand before him all his life.&nbsp; He

<P>took no share in the chatter of his comrades, nor

<P>did he look at them or know them, save when he

<P>felt sudden suspicion that they were seeing his

<P>thoughts and scrutinizing each detail of the scene

<P>with the tattered soldier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Yet gradually he mustered force to put the sin

<P>at a distance.&nbsp; And at last his eyes seemed to

<P>open to some new ways.&nbsp; He found that he could

<P>look back upon the brass and bombast of his

<P>earlier gospels and see them truly.&nbsp; He was

<P>gleeful when he discovered that he now despised

<P>them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With this conviction came a store of assur-

<P>ance.&nbsp; He felt a quiet manhood, nonassertive but

<P>of sturdy and strong blood.&nbsp; He knew that he

<P>would no more quail before his guides wher-

<P>ever they should point.&nbsp; He had been to touch

<P>the great death, and found that, after all, it was

<P>but the great death.&nbsp; He was a man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So it came to pass that as he trudged from

<P>the place of blood and wrath his soul changed.

<P>He came from hot plowshares to prospects of

<P>clover tranquilly, and it was as if hot plowshares

<P>were not.&nbsp; Scars faded as flowers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It rained.&nbsp; The procession of weary soldiers

<P>became a bedraggled train, despondent and

<P>muttering, marching with churning effort in a

<P>trough of liquid brown mud under a low,

<P>wretched sky.&nbsp; Yet the youth smiled, for he saw

<P>that the world was a world for him, though many

<P>discovered it to be made of oaths and walking

<P>sticks.&nbsp; He had rid himself of the red sickness of

<P>battle.&nbsp; The sultry nightmare was in the past.

<P>He had been an animal blistered and sweating in

<P>the heat and pain of war.&nbsp; He turned now with a

<P>lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh

<P>meadows, cool brooks--an existence of soft and

<P>eternal peace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Over the river a golden ray of sun came

<P>through the hosts of leaden rain clouds.
