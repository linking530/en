<BR>&nbsp;

<P>WHEN the woods again began to pour forth

<P>the dark-hued masses of the enemy the youth felt

<P>serene self-confidence.&nbsp; He smiled briefly when

<P>he saw men dodge and duck at the long screech-

<P>ings of shells that were thrown in giant handfuls

<P>over them.&nbsp; He stood, erect and tranquil, watch-

<P>ing the attack begin against a part of the line

<P>that made a blue curve along the side of an adja-

<P>cent hill.&nbsp; His vision being unmolested by smoke

<P>from the rifles of his companions, he had oppor-

<P>tunities to see parts of the hard fight.&nbsp; It was a

<P>relief to perceive at last from whence came some

<P>of these noises which had been roared into his

<P>ears.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Off a short way he saw two regiments fight-

<P>ing a little separate battle with two other regi-

<P>ments.&nbsp; It was in a cleared space, wearing a set-

<P>apart look.&nbsp; They were blazing as if upon a

<P>wager, giving and taking tremendous blows.

<P>The firings were incredibly fierce and rapid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>209

<P>These intent regiments apparently were oblivious

<P>of all larger purposes of war, and were slugging

<P>each other as if at a matched game.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In another direction he saw a magnificent

<P>brigade going with the evident intention of driv-

<P>ing the enemy from a wood.&nbsp; They passed in out

<P>of sight and presently there was a most awe-in-

<P>spiring racket in the wood.&nbsp; The noise was un-

<P>speakable.&nbsp; Having stirred this prodigious up-

<P>roar, and, apparently, finding it too prodigious,

<P>the brigade, after a little time, came marching

<P>airily out again with its fine formation in nowise

<P>disturbed.&nbsp; There were no traces of speed in its

<P>movements.&nbsp; The brigade was jaunty and seemed

<P>to point a proud thumb at the yelling wood.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On a slope to the left there was a long row of

<P>guns, gruff and maddened, denouncing the

<P>enemy, who, down through the woods, were

<P>forming for another attack in the pitiless mo-

<P>notony of conflicts.&nbsp; The round red discharges

<P>from the guns made a crimson flare and a high,

<P>thick smoke.&nbsp; Occasional glimpses could be

<P>caught of groups of the toiling artillerymen.&nbsp; In

<P>the rear of this row of guns stood a house, calm

<P>and white, amid bursting shells.&nbsp; A congregation

<P>of horses, tied to a long railing, were tugging

<P>frenziedly at their bridles.&nbsp; Men were running

<P>hither and thither.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The detached battle between the four regi-

<P>ments lasted for some time.&nbsp; There chanced to

<P>be no interference, and they settled their dispute

<P>by themselves.&nbsp; They struck savagely and pow-

<P>erfully at each other for a period of minutes, and

<P>then the lighter-hued regiments faltered and

<P>drew back, leaving the dark-blue lines shouting.

<P>The youth could see the two flags shaking with

<P>laughter amid the smoke remnants.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently there was a stillness, pregnant with

<P>meaning.&nbsp; The blue lines shifted and changed a

<P>trifle and stared expectantly at the silent woods

<P>and fields before them.&nbsp; The hush was solemn

<P>and churchlike, save for a distant battery that,

<P>evidently unable to remain quiet, sent a faint

<P>rolling thunder over the ground.&nbsp; It irritated,

<P>like the noises of unimpressed boys.&nbsp; The men

<P>imagined that it would prevent their perched

<P>ears from hearing the first words of the new

<P>battle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of a sudden the guns on the slope roared out

<P>a message of warning.&nbsp; A spluttering sound had

<P>begun in the woods.&nbsp; It swelled with amazing

<P>speed to a profound clamor that involved the

<P>earth in noises.&nbsp; The splitting crashes swept

<P>along the lines until an interminable roar was

<P>developed.&nbsp; To those in the midst of it it became

<P>a din fitted to the universe.&nbsp; It was the whirring

<P>and thumping of gigantic machinery, complica-

<P>tions among the smaller stars.&nbsp; The youth's ears

<P>were filled up.&nbsp; They were incapable of hearing

<P>more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On an incline over which a road wound he

<P>saw wild and desperate rushes of men perpet-

<P>ually backward and forward in riotous surges.

<P>These parts of the opposing armies were two

<P>long waves that pitched upon each other madly

<P>at dictated points.&nbsp; To and fro they swelled.

<P>Sometimes, one side by its yells and cheers would

<P>proclaim decisive blows, but a moment later

<P>the other side would be all yells and cheers.

<P>Once the youth saw a spray of light forms go in

<P>houndlike leaps toward the waving blue lines.

<P>There was much howling, and presently it went

<P>away with a vast mouthful of prisoners.&nbsp; Again,

<P>he saw a blue wave dash with such thunderous

<P>force against a gray obstruction that it seemed to

<P>clear the earth of it and leave nothing but

<P>trampled sod.&nbsp; And always in their swift and

<P>deadly rushes to and fro the men screamed

<P>and yelled like maniacs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Particular pieces of fence or secure positions

<P>behind collections of trees were wrangled over,

<P>as gold thrones or pearl bedsteads.&nbsp; There were

<P>desperate lunges at these chosen spots seemingly

<P>every instant, and most of them were bandied like

<P>light toys between the contending forces.&nbsp; The

<P>youth could not tell from the battle flags flying

<P>like crimson foam in many directions which color

<P>of cloth was winning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His emaciated regiment bustled forth with

<P>undiminished fierceness when its time came.

<P>When assaulted again by bullets, the men burst

<P>out in a barbaric cry of rage and pain.&nbsp; They

<P>bent their heads in aims of intent hatred

<P>behind the projected hammers of their guns.

<P>Their ramrods clanged loud with fury as their

<P>eager arms pounded the cartridges into the rifle

<P>barrels.&nbsp; The front of the regiment was a smoke-

<P>wall penetrated by the flashing points of yellow

<P>and red.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wallowing in the fight, they were in an

<P>astonishingly short time resmudged.&nbsp; They

<P>surpassed in stain and dirt all their previous ap-

<P>pearances.&nbsp; Moving to and fro with strained

<P>exertion, jabbering the while, they were, with

<P>their swaying bodies, black faces, and glowing

<P>eyes, like strange and ugly friends jigging heavily

<P>in the smoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lieutenant, returning from a tour after a

<P>bandage, produced from a hidden receptacle of

<P>his mind new and portentous oaths suited to the

<P>emergency.&nbsp; Strings of expletives he swung

<P>lashlike over the backs of his men, and it was

<P>evident that his previous efforts had in nowise

<P>impaired his resources.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, still the bearer of the colors, did

<P>not feel his idleness.&nbsp; He was deeply absorbed as

<P>a spectator.&nbsp; The crash and swing of the great

<P>drama made him lean forward, intent-eyed, his

<P>face working in small contortions.&nbsp; Sometimes he

<P>prattled, words coming unconsciously from him

<P>in grotesque exclamations.&nbsp; He did not know

<P>that he breathed; that the flag hung silently over

<P>him, so absorbed was he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A formidable line of the enemy came within

<P>dangerous range.&nbsp; They could be seen plainly--

<P>tall, gaunt men with excited faces running with

<P>long strides toward a wandering fence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At sight of this danger the men suddenly

<P>ceased their cursing monotone.&nbsp; There was an

<P>instant of strained silence before they threw up

<P>their rifles and fired a plumping volley at the

<P>foes.&nbsp; There had been no order given; the men,

<P>upon recognizing the menace, had immedi-

<P>ately let drive their flock of bullets without wait-

<P>ing for word of command.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the enemy were quick to gain the protec-

<P>tion of the wandering line of fence.&nbsp; They slid down

<P>behind it with remarkable celerity, and from this

<P>position they began briskly to slice up the blue men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These latter braced their energies for a great

<P>struggle.&nbsp; Often, white clinched teeth shone

<P>from the dusky faces.&nbsp; Many heads surged to

<P>and fro, floating upon a pale sea of smoke.

<P>Those behind the fence frequently shouted and

<P>yelped in taunts and gibelike cries, but the regi-

<P>ment maintained a stressed silence.&nbsp; Perhaps, at

<P>this new assault the men recalled the fact that

<P>they had been named mud diggers, and it made

<P>their situation thrice bitter.&nbsp; They were breath-

<P>lessly intent upon keeping the ground and thrust-

<P>ing away the rejoicing body of the enemy.&nbsp; They

<P>fought swiftly and with a despairing savageness

<P>denoted in their expressions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had resolved not to budge what-

<P>ever should happen.&nbsp; Some arrows of scorn that

<P>had buried themselves in his heart had generated

<P>strange and unspeakable hatred.&nbsp; It was clear

<P>to him that his final and absolute revenge was to

<P>be achieved by his dead body lying, torn and

<P>gluttering, upon the field.&nbsp; This was to be a

<P>poignant retaliation upon the officer who had

<P>said "mule drivers," and later "mud diggers,"

<P>for in all the wild graspings of his mind for a

<P>unit responsible for his sufferings and commo-

<P>tions he always seized upon the man who had

<P>dubbed him wrongly.&nbsp; And it was his idea,

<P>vaguely formulated, that his corpse would be for

<P>those eyes a great and salt reproach.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The regiment bled extravagantly.&nbsp; Grunting

<P>bundles of blue began to drop.&nbsp; The orderly

<P>sergeant of the youth's company was shot through

<P>the cheeks.&nbsp; Its supports being injured, his jaw

<P>hung afar down, disclosing in the wide cavern of

<P>his mouth a pulsing mass of blood and teeth.

<P>And with it all he made attempts to cry out.

<P>In his endeavor there was a dreadful earnestness,

<P>as if he conceived that one great shriek would

<P>make him well.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth saw him presently go rearward.

<P>His strength seemed in nowise impaired.&nbsp; He

<P>ran swiftly, casting wild glances for succor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Others fell down about the feet of their com-

<P>panions.&nbsp; Some of the wounded crawled out and

<P>away, but many lay still, their bodies twisted into

<P>impossible shapes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth looked once for his friend.&nbsp; He

<P>saw a vehement young man, powder-smeared and

<P>frowzled, whom he knew to be him.&nbsp; The lieu-

<P>tenant, also, was unscathed in his position at the

<P>rear.&nbsp; He had continued to curse, but it was now

<P>with the air of a man who was using his last box

<P>of oaths.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the fire of the regiment had begun to

<P>wane and drip.&nbsp; The robust voice, that had come

<P>strangely from the thin ranks, was growing

<P>rapidly weak.
