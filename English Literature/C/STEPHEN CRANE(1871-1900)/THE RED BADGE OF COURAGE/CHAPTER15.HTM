<P>THE regiment was standing at order arms at

<P>the side of a lane, waiting for the command to

<P>march, when suddenly the youth remembered

<P>the little packet enwrapped in a faded yellow

<P>envelope which the loud young soldier with lugu-

<P>brious words had intrusted to him.&nbsp; It made him

<P>start.&nbsp; He uttered an exclamation and turned

<P>toward his comrade.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wilson!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend, at his side in the ranks, was thought-

<P>fully staring down the road.&nbsp; From some cause

<P>his expression was at that moment very meek.

<P>The youth, regarding him with sidelong glances,

<P>felt impelled to change his purpose.&nbsp; "Oh, noth-

<P>ing," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend turned his head in some surprise,

<P>"Why, what was yeh goin' t' say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, nothing," repeated the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He resolved not to deal the little blow.&nbsp; It
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>148

<P>was sufficient that the fact made him glad.&nbsp; It

<P>was not necessary to knock his friend on the head

<P>with the misguided packet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had been possessed of much fear of his

<P>friend, for he saw how easily questionings could

<P>make holes in his feelings.&nbsp; Lately, he had as-

<P>sured himself that the altered comrade would not

<P>tantalize him with a persistent curiosity, but he

<P>felt certain that during the first period of leisure

<P>his friend would ask him to relate his adventures

<P>of the previous day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He now rejoiced in the possession of a small

<P>weapon with which he could prostrate his com-

<P>rade at the first signs of a cross-examination.&nbsp; He

<P>was master.&nbsp; It would now be he who could

<P>laugh and shoot the shafts of derision.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend had, in a weak hour, spoken with

<P>sobs of his own death.&nbsp; He had delivered a mel-

<P>ancholy oration previous to his funeral, and had

<P>doubtless in the packet of letters, presented vari-

<P>ous keepsakes to relatives.&nbsp; But he had not died,

<P>and thus he had delivered himself into the hands

<P>of the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The latter felt immensely superior to his

<P>friend, but he inclined to condescension.&nbsp; He

<P>adopted toward him an air of patronizing good

<P>humor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His self-pride was now entirely restored.&nbsp; In

<P>the shade of its flourishing growth he stood with

<P>braced and self-confident legs, and since nothing

<P>could now be discovered he did not shrink from

<P>an encounter with the eyes of judges, and allowed

<P>no thoughts of his own to keep him from an

<P>attitude of manfulness.&nbsp; He had performed his

<P>mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Indeed, when he remembered his fortunes of

<P>yesterday, and looked at them from a distance he

<P>began to see something fine there.&nbsp; He had

<P>license to be pompous and veteranlike.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His panting agonies of the past he put out of

<P>his sight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the present, he declared to himself that it

<P>was only the doomed and the damned who roared

<P>with sincerity at circumstance.&nbsp; Few but they

<P>ever did it.&nbsp; A man with a full stomach and the

<P>respect of his fellows had no business to scold

<P>about anything that he might think to be wrong

<P>in the ways of the universe, or even with the

<P>ways of society.&nbsp; Let the unfortunates rail; the

<P>others may play marbles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not give a great deal of thought to

<P>these battles that lay directly before him.&nbsp; It was

<P>not essential that he should plan his ways in

<P>regard to them.&nbsp; He had been taught that many

<P>obligations of a life were easily avoided.&nbsp; The

<P>lessons of yesterday had been that retribution

<P>was a laggard and blind.&nbsp; With these facts before

<P>him he did not deem it necessary that he should

<P>become feverish over the possibilities of the

<P>ensuing twenty-four hours.&nbsp; He could leave

<P>much to chance.&nbsp; Besides, a faith in himself had

<P>secretly blossomed.&nbsp; There was a little flower of

<P>confidence growing within him.&nbsp; He was now a

<P>man of experience.&nbsp; He had been out among the

<P>dragons, he said, and he assured himself that they

<P>were not so hideous as he had imagined them.

<P>Also, they were inaccurate; they did not sting

<P>with precision.&nbsp; A stout heart often defied, and

<P>defying, escaped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And, furthermore, how could they kill him

<P>who was the chosen of gods and doomed to

<P>greatness?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He remembered how some of the men had

<P>run from the battle.&nbsp; As he recalled their terror-

<P>struck faces he felt a scorn for them.&nbsp; They had

<P>surely been more fleet and more wild than was

<P>absolutely necessary.&nbsp; They were weak mortals.

<P>As for himself, he had fled with discretion and

<P>dignity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was aroused from this reverie by his

<P>friend, who, having hitched about nervously and

<P>blinked at the trees for a time, suddenly coughed

<P>in an introductory way, and spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fleming!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The friend put his hand up to his mouth and

<P>coughed again.&nbsp; He fidgeted in his jacket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," he gulped, at last, "I guess yeh might

<P>as well give me back them letters."&nbsp; Dark, prick-

<P>ling blood had flushed into his cheeks and brow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All right, Wilson," said the youth.&nbsp; He

<P>loosened two buttons of his coat, thrust in his

<P>hand, and brought forth the packet.&nbsp; As he ex-

<P>tended it to his friend the latter's face was turned

<P>from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had been slow in the act of producing the

<P>packet because during it he had been trying to

<P>invent a remarkable comment upon the affair.

<P>He could conjure nothing of sufficient point.&nbsp; He

<P>was compelled to allow his friend to escape

<P>unmolested with his packet.&nbsp; And for this he

<P>took unto himself considerable credit.&nbsp; It was a

<P>generous thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His friend at his side seemed suffering great

<P>shame.&nbsp; As he contemplated him, the youth felt

<P>his heart grow more strong and stout.&nbsp; He had

<P>never been compelled to blush in such manner

<P>for his acts; he was an individual of extraordi-

<P>nary virtues.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He reflected, with condescending pity: "Too

<P>bad!&nbsp; Too bad!&nbsp; The poor devil, it makes him

<P>feel tough!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this incident, and as he reviewed the

<P>battle pictures he had seen, he felt quite com-

<P>petent to return home and make the hearts of

<P>the people glow with stories of war.&nbsp; He could

<P>see himself in a room of warm tints telling tales

<P>to listeners.&nbsp; He could exhibit laurels.&nbsp; They

<P>were insignificant; still, in a district where

<P>laurels were infrequent, they might shine.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He saw his gaping audience picturing him as

<P>the central figure in blazing scenes.&nbsp; And he

<P>imagined the consternation and the ejaculations

<P>of his mother and the young lady at the seminary

<P>as they drank his recitals.&nbsp; Their vague feminine

<P>formula for beloved ones doing brave deeds on

<P>the field of battle without risk of life would be

<P>destroyed.
