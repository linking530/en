<P>THE youth fell back in the procession until

<P>the tattered soldier was not in sight.&nbsp; Then he

<P>started to walk on with the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he was amid wounds.&nbsp; The mob of men

<P>was bleeding.&nbsp; Because of the tattered soldier's

<P>question he now felt that his shame could be

<P>viewed.&nbsp; He was continually casting sidelong

<P>glances to see if the men were contemplating the

<P>letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At times he regarded the wounded soldiers

<P>in an envious way.&nbsp; He conceived persons with

<P>torn bodies to be peculiarly happy.&nbsp; He wished

<P>that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of cour-

<P>age.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The spectral soldier was at his side like a

<P>stalking reproach.&nbsp; The man's eyes were still

<P>fixed in a stare into the unknown.&nbsp; His gray,

<P>appalling face had attracted attention in the

<P>crowd, and men, slowing to his dreary pace, were

<P>walking with him.&nbsp; They were discussing his

<P>plight, questioning him and giving him advice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>91

<P>In a dogged way he repelled them, signing to them

<P>to go on and leave him alone.&nbsp; The shadows of

<P>his face were deepening and his tight lips seemed

<P>holding in check the moan of great despair.

<P>There could be seen a certain stiffness in the

<P>movements of his body, as if he were taking

<P>infinite care not to arouse the passion of his

<P>wounds.&nbsp; As he went on, he seemed always look-

<P>ing for a place, like one who goes to choose a

<P>grave.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Something in the gesture of the man as he

<P>waved the bloody and pitying soldiers away

<P>made the youth start as if bitten.&nbsp; He yelled in

<P>horror.&nbsp; Tottering forward he laid a quivering

<P>hand upon the man's arm.&nbsp; As the latter slowly

<P>turned his waxlike features toward him, the

<P>youth screamed:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gawd!&nbsp; Jim Conklin!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier made a little commonplace

<P>smile.&nbsp; "Hello, Henry," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth swayed on his legs and glared

<P>strangely.&nbsp; He stuttered and stammered.&nbsp; "Oh,

<P>Jim--oh, Jim--oh, Jim--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier held out his gory hand.&nbsp; There

<P>was a curious red and black combination of new

<P>blood and old blood upon it.&nbsp; "Where yeh been,

<P>Henry?" he asked.&nbsp; He continued in a monoto-

<P>nous voice, "I thought mebbe yeh got keeled

<P>over.&nbsp; There 's been thunder t' pay t'-day.&nbsp; I was

<P>worryin' about it a good deal."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth still lamented.&nbsp; "Oh, Jim--oh, Jim

<P>--oh, Jim--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh know," said the tall soldier, "I was out

<P>there."&nbsp; He made a careful gesture.&nbsp; "An',

<P>Lord, what a circus!&nbsp; An', b'jiminey, I got shot--

<P>I got shot.&nbsp; Yes, b'jiminey, I got shot."&nbsp; He

<P>reiterated this fact in a bewildered way, as if he

<P>did not know how it came about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth put forth anxious arms to assist

<P>him, but the tall soldier went firmly on as if pro-

<P>pelled.&nbsp; Since the youth's arrival as a guardian

<P>for his friend, the other wounded men had ceased

<P>to display much interest.&nbsp; They occupied them-

<P>selves again in dragging their own tragedies

<P>toward the rear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly, as the two friends marched on, the

<P>tall soldier seemed to be overcome by a terror.

<P>His face turned to a semblance of gray paste.

<P>He clutched the youth's arm and looked all about

<P>him, as if dreading to be overheard.&nbsp; Then he

<P>began to speak in a shaking whisper:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I tell yeh what I'm 'fraid of, Henry--I 'll tell

<P>yeh what I 'm 'fraid of.&nbsp; I 'm 'fraid I 'll fall down

<P>--an' then yeh know--them damned artillery

<P>wagons--they like as not 'll run over me.&nbsp; That 's

<P>what I 'm 'fraid of--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth cried out to him hysterically: "I 'll

<P>take care of yeh, Jim!&nbsp; I'll take care of yeh!&nbsp; I

<P>swear t' Gawd I will!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure--will yeh, Henry?" the tall soldier

<P>beseeched.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes--yes--I tell yeh--I'll take care of yeh,

<P>Jim!" protested the youth.&nbsp; He could not speak

<P>accurately because of the gulpings in his throat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But the tall soldier continued to beg in a

<P>lowly way.&nbsp; He now hung babelike to the

<P>youth's arm.&nbsp; His eyes rolled in the wildness of

<P>his terror.&nbsp; "I was allus a good friend t' yeh,

<P>wa'n't I, Henry?&nbsp; I 've allus been a pretty good

<P>feller, ain't I?&nbsp; An' it ain't much t' ask, is it?&nbsp; Jest

<P>t' pull me along outer th' road?&nbsp; I 'd do it fer you,

<P>Wouldn't I, Henry?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He paused in piteous anxiety to await his

<P>friend's reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had reached an anguish where the

<P>sobs scorched him.&nbsp; He strove to express his

<P>loyalty, but he could only make fantastic gestures.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However, the tall soldier seemed suddenly to

<P>forget all those fears.&nbsp; He became again the

<P>grim, stalking specter of a soldier.&nbsp; He went

<P>stonily forward.&nbsp; The youth wished his friend to

<P>lean upon him, but the other always shook his

<P>head and strangely protested.&nbsp; "No--no--no--

<P>leave me be--leave me be--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His look was fixed again upon the unknown.

<P>He moved with mysterious purpose, and all of

<P>the youth's offers he brushed aside.&nbsp; "No--no--

<P>leave me be--leave me be--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had to follow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Presently the latter heard a voice talking

<P>softly near his shoulders.&nbsp; Turning he saw that it

<P>belonged to the tattered soldier.&nbsp; "Ye 'd better

<P>take 'im outa th' road, pardner.&nbsp; There 's a batt'ry

<P>comin' helitywhoop down th' road an' he 'll git

<P>runned over.&nbsp; He 's a goner anyhow in about five

<P>minutes--yeh kin see that.&nbsp; Ye 'd better take 'im

<P>outa th' road.&nbsp; Where th' blazes does he git his

<P>stren'th from?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lord knows!" cried the youth.&nbsp; He was

<P>shaking his hands helplessly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He ran forward presently and grasped the

<P>tall soldier by the arm.&nbsp; "Jim!&nbsp; Jim!" he coaxed,

<P>"come with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier weakly tried to wrench himself

<P>free.&nbsp; "Huh," he said vacantly.&nbsp; He stared at the

<P>youth for a moment.&nbsp; At last he spoke as if dimly

<P>comprehending.&nbsp; "Oh!&nbsp; Inteh th' fields?&nbsp; Oh!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He started blindly through the grass.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth turned once to look at the lashing

<P>riders and jouncing guns of the battery.&nbsp; He was

<P>startled from this view by a shrill outcry from

<P>the tattered man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gawd!&nbsp; He's runnin'!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Turning his head swiftly, the youth saw his

<P>friend running in a staggering and stumbling

<P>way toward a little clump of bushes.&nbsp; His heart

<P>seemed to wrench itself almost free from his

<P>body at this sight.&nbsp; He made a noise of pain.

<P>He and the tattered man began a pursuit.&nbsp; There

<P>was a singular race.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he overtook the tall soldier he began

<P>to plead with all the words he could find.&nbsp; "Jim

<P>--Jim--what are you doing--what makes you do

<P>this way--you 'll hurt yerself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The same purpose was in the tall soldier's face.

<P>He protested in a dulled way, keeping his eyes

<P>fastened on the mystic place of his intentions.

<P>"No--no--don't tech me--leave me be--leave

<P>me be--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, aghast and filled with wonder at the

<P>tall soldier, began quaveringly to question him.

<P>"Where yeh goin', Jim?&nbsp; What you thinking

<P>about?&nbsp; Where you going?&nbsp; Tell me, won't you,

<P>Jim?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier faced about as upon relentless

<P>pursuers.&nbsp; In his eyes there was a great appeal.

<P>"Leave me be, can't yeh?&nbsp; Leave me be fer a

<P>minnit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth recoiled.&nbsp; "Why, Jim," he said, in

<P>a dazed way, "what's the matter with you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier turned and, lurching danger-

<P>ously, went on.&nbsp; The youth and the tattered

<P>soldier followed, sneaking as if whipped, feeling

<P>unable to face the stricken man if he should again

<P>confront them.&nbsp; They began to have thoughts of

<P>a solemn ceremony.&nbsp; There was something rite-

<P>like in these movements of the doomed soldier.

<P>And there was a resemblance in him to a devotee

<P>of a mad religion, blood-sucking, muscle-wrench-

<P>ing, bone-crushing.&nbsp; They were awed and afraid.

<P>They hung back lest he have at command a

<P>dreadful weapon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last, they saw him stop and stand motion-

<P>less.&nbsp; Hastening up, they perceived that his face

<P>wore an expression telling that he had at last

<P>found the place for which he had struggled.&nbsp; His

<P>spare figure was erect; his bloody hands were

<P>quietly at his side.&nbsp; He was waiting with patience

<P>for something that he had come to meet.&nbsp; He was

<P>at the rendezvous.&nbsp; They paused and stood, ex-

<P>pectant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a silence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Finally, the chest of the doomed soldier began

<P>to heave with a strained motion.&nbsp; It increased in

<P>violence until it was as if an animal was within

<P>and was kicking and tumbling furiously to be

<P>free.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This spectacle of gradual strangulation made

<P>the youth writhe, and once as his friend rolled his

<P>eyes, he saw something in them that made him

<P>sink wailing to the ground.&nbsp; He raised his voice

<P>in a last supreme call.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jim--Jim--Jim--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier opened his lips and spoke.

<P>He made a gesture.&nbsp; "Leave me be--don't tech

<P>me--leave me be--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was another silence while he waited.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly, his form stiffened and straightened.

<P>Then it was shaken by a prolonged ague.&nbsp; He

<P>stared into space.&nbsp; To the two watchers there

<P>was a curious and profound dignity in the firm

<P>lines of his awful face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was invaded by a creeping strangeness

<P>that slowly enveloped him.&nbsp; For a moment the

<P>tremor of his legs caused him to dance a sort of

<P>hideous hornpipe.&nbsp; His arms beat wildly about

<P>his head in expression of implike enthusiasm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His tall figure stretched itself to its full height.

<P>There was a slight rending sound.&nbsp; Then it began

<P>to swing forward, slow and straight, in the man-

<P>ner of a falling tree.&nbsp; A swift muscular contortion

<P>made the left shoulder strike the ground first.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The body seemed to bounce a little way from

<P>the earth.&nbsp; "God!" said the tattered soldier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth had watched, spellbound, this

<P>ceremony at the place of meeting.&nbsp; His face

<P>had been twisted into an expression of every

<P>agony he had imagined for his friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He now sprang to his feet and, going closer,

<P>gazed upon the pastelike face.&nbsp; The mouth was

<P>open and the teeth showed in a laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the flap of the blue jacket fell away from

<P>the body, he could see that the side looked as if it

<P>had been chewed by wolves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth turned, with sudden, livid rage,

<P>toward the battlefield.&nbsp; He shook his fist.&nbsp; He

<P>seemed about to deliver a philippic.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hell--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.
