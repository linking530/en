<P>THE cold passed reluctantly from the earth,

<P>and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched

<P>out on the hills, resting.&nbsp; As the landscape

<P>changed from brown to green, the army awak-

<P>ened, and began to tremble with eagerness at the

<P>noise of rumors.&nbsp; It cast its eyes upon the roads,

<P>which were growing from long troughs of liquid

<P>mud to proper thoroughfares.&nbsp; A river, amber-

<P>tinted in the shadow of its banks, purled at the

<P>army's feet; and at night, when the stream had

<P>become of a sorrowful blackness, one could see

<P>across it the red, eyelike gleam of hostile camp-

<P>fires set in the low brows of distant hills.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once a certain tall soldier developed virtues

<P>and went resolutely to wash a shirt.&nbsp; He came

<P>flying back from a brook waving his garment

<P>bannerlike.&nbsp; He was swelled with a tale he had

<P>heard from a reliable friend, who had heard it

<P>from a truthful cavalryman, who had heard it

<P>from his trustworthy brother, one of the order-

<P>lies at division headquarters.&nbsp; He adopted the

<P>important air of a herald in red and gold.

<P>"We're goin' t' move t' morrah--sure," he

<P>said pompously to a group in the company

<P>street.&nbsp; "We're goin' 'way up the river, cut

<P>across, an' come around in behint 'em."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To his attentive audience he drew a loud

<P>and elaborate plan of a very brilliant campaign.

<P>When he had finished, the blue-clothed men

<P>scattered into small arguing groups between the

<P>rows of squat brown huts.&nbsp; A negro teamster who

<P>had been dancing upon a cracker box with the

<P>hilarious encouragement of twoscore soldiers

<P>was deserted.&nbsp; He sat mournfully down.&nbsp; Smoke

<P>drifted lazily from a multitude of quaint chim-

<P>neys.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It's a lie! that's all it is--a thunderin' lie!"

<P>said another private loudly.&nbsp; His smooth face was

<P>flushed, and his hands were thrust sulkily into his

<P>trousers' pockets.&nbsp; He took the matter as an

<P>affront to him.&nbsp; "I don't believe the derned old

<P>army's ever going to move.&nbsp; We're set.&nbsp; I've

<P>got ready to move eight times in the last two

<P>weeks, and we ain't moved yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall soldier felt called upon to defend

<P>the truth of a rumor he himself had intro-

<P>duced.&nbsp; He and the loud one came near to fight-

<P>ing over it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A corporal began to swear before the assem-

<P>blage.&nbsp; He had just put a costly board floor in

<P>his house, he said.&nbsp; During the early spring he

<P>had refrained from adding extensively to the

<P>comfort of his environment because he had felt

<P>that the army might start on the march at any

<P>moment.&nbsp; Of late, however, he had been im-

<P>pressed that they were in a sort of eternal camp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Many of the men engaged in a spirited debate.

<P>One outlined in a peculiarly lucid manner all the

<P>plans of the commanding general.&nbsp; He was op-

<P>posed by men who advocated that there were

<P>other plans of campaign.&nbsp; They clamored at each

<P>other, numbers making futile bids for the pop-

<P>ular attention.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the soldier who had

<P>fetched the rumor bustled about with much

<P>importance.&nbsp; He was continually assailed by

<P>questions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's up, Jim?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Th' army's goin' t' move."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what yeh talkin' about?&nbsp; How yeh know

<P>it is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, yeh kin b'lieve me er not, jest as yeh

<P>like.&nbsp; I don't care a hang."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was much food for thought in the man-

<P>ner in which he replied.&nbsp; He came near to con-

<P>vincing them by disdaining to produce proofs.

<P>They grew excited over it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a youthful private who listened

<P>with eager ears to the words of the tall soldier

<P>and to the varied comments of his comrades.

<P>After receiving a fill of discussions concerning

<P>marches and attacks, he went to his hut and

<P>crawled through an intricate hole that served it

<P>as a door.&nbsp; He wished to be alone with some

<P>new thoughts that had lately come to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He lay down on a wide bank that stretched

<P>across the end of the room.&nbsp; In the other end,

<P>cracker boxes were made to serve as furniture.

<P>They were grouped about the fireplace.&nbsp; A pic-

<P>ture from an illustrated weekly was upon the log

<P>walls, and three rifles were paralleled on pegs.

<P>Equipments hunt on handy projections, and some

<P>tin dishes lay upon a small pile of firewood.&nbsp; A

<P>folded tent was serving as a roof.&nbsp; The sunlight,

<P>without, beating upon it, made it glow a light

<P>yellow shade.&nbsp; A small window shot an oblique

<P>square of whiter light upon the cluttered floor.

<P>The smoke from the fire at times neglected the

<P>clay chimney and wreathed into the room, and

<P>this flimsy chimney of clay and sticks made end-

<P>less threats to set ablaze the whole establishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth was in a little trance of astonish-

<P>ment.&nbsp; So they were at last going to fight.&nbsp; On

<P>the morrow, perhaps, there would be a battle, and

<P>he would be in it.&nbsp; For a time he was obliged

<P>to labor to make himself believe.&nbsp; He could not

<P>accept with assurance an omen that he was about

<P>to mingle in one of those great affairs of the earth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had, of course, dreamed of battles all

<P>his life--of vague and bloody conflicts that had

<P>thrilled him with their sweep and fire.&nbsp; In visions

<P>he had seen himself in many struggles.&nbsp; He had

<P>imagined peoples secure in the shadow of his

<P>eagle-eyed prowess.&nbsp; But awake he had regarded

<P>battles as crimson blotches on the pages of the

<P>past.&nbsp; He had put them as things of the bygone

<P>with his thought-images of heavy crowns and

<P>high castles.&nbsp; There was a portion of the world's

<P>history which he had regarded as the time of

<P>wars, but it, he thought, had been long gone over

<P>the horizon and had disappeared forever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From his home his youthful eyes had looked

<P>upon the war in his own country with distrust.

<P>It must be some sort of a play affair.&nbsp; He had

<P>long despaired of witnessing a Greeklike struggle.

<P>Such would be no more, he had said.&nbsp; Men were

<P>better, or more timid.&nbsp; Secular and religious

<P>education had effaced the throat-grappling in-

<P>stinct, or else firm finance held in check the pas-

<P>sions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had burned several times to enlist.&nbsp; Tales

<P>of great movements shook the land.&nbsp; They might

<P>not be distinctly Homeric, but there seemed to

<P>be much glory in them.&nbsp; He had read of marches,

<P>sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all.

<P>His busy mind had drawn for him large pictures

<P>extravagant in color, lurid with breathless deeds.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But his mother had discouraged him.&nbsp; She

<P>had affected to look with some contempt upon

<P>the quality of his war ardor and patriotism.&nbsp; She

<P>could calmly seat herself and with no apparent

<P>difficulty give him many hundreds of reasons

<P>why he was of vastly more importance on the

<P>farm than on the field of battle.&nbsp; She had had

<P>certain ways of expression that told him that her

<P>statements on the subject came from a deep con-

<P>viction.&nbsp; Moreover, on her side, was his belief

<P>that her ethical motive in the argument was

<P>impregnable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last, however, he had made firm rebellion

<P>against this yellow light thrown upon the color of

<P>his ambitions.&nbsp; The newspapers, the gossip of the

<P>village, his own picturings had aroused him to

<P>an uncheckable degree.&nbsp; They were in truth

<P>fighting finely down there.&nbsp; Almost every day

<P>the newspapers printed accounts of a decisive

<P>victory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One night, as he lay in bed, the winds had

<P>carried to him the clangoring of the church bell

<P>as some enthusiast jerked the rope frantically to

<P>tell the twisted news of a great battle.&nbsp; This

<P>voice of the people rejoicing in the night had

<P>made him shiver in a prolonged ecstasy of ex-

<P>citement.&nbsp; Later, he had gone down to his

<P>mother's room and had spoken thus: "Ma, I'm

<P>going to enlist."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Henry, don't you be a fool," his mother had

<P>replied.&nbsp; She had then covered her face with the

<P>quilt.&nbsp; There was an end to the matter for that

<P>night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nevertheless, the next morning he had gone

<P>to a town that was near his mother's farm and

<P>had enlisted in a company that was forming there.

<P>When he had returned home his mother was

<P>milking the brindle cow.&nbsp; Four others stood

<P>waiting.&nbsp; "Ma, I've enlisted," he had said to her

<P>diffidently.&nbsp; There was a short silence.&nbsp; "The

<P>Lord's will be done, Henry," she had finally

<P>replied, and had then continued to milk the

<P>brindle cow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he had stood in the doorway with his

<P>soldier's clothes on his back, and with the light of

<P>excitement and expectancy in his eyes almost

<P>defeating the glow of regret for the home bonds,

<P>he had seen two tears leaving their trails on his

<P>mother's scarred cheeks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Still, she had disappointed him by saying

<P>nothing whatever about returning with his shield

<P>or on it.&nbsp; He had privately primed himself for a

<P>beautiful scene.&nbsp; He had prepared certain sen-

<P>tences which he thought could be used with

<P>touching effect.&nbsp; But her words destroyed his

<P>plans.&nbsp; She had doggedly peeled potatoes and

<P>addressed him as follows: "You watch out,

<P>Henry, an' take good care of yerself in this here

<P>fighting business--you watch out, an' take good

<P>care of yerself.&nbsp; Don't go a-thinkin' you can

<P>lick the hull rebel army at the start, because yeh

<P>can't.&nbsp; Yer jest one little feller amongst a hull lot

<P>of others, and yeh've got to keep quiet an' do what

<P>they tell yeh.&nbsp; I know how you are, Henry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I've knet yeh eight pair of socks, Henry, and

<P>I've put in all yer best shirts, because I want my

<P>boy to be jest as warm and comf'able as anybody

<P>in the army.&nbsp; Whenever they get holes in 'em, I

<P>want yeh to send 'em right-away back to me, so's

<P>I kin dern 'em.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"An' allus be careful an' choose yer comp'ny.

<P>There's lots of bad men in the army, Henry.

<P>The army makes 'em wild, and they like nothing

<P>better than the job of leading off a young feller

<P>like you, as ain't never been away from home

<P>much and has allus had a mother, an' a-learning

<P>'em to drink and swear.&nbsp; Keep clear of them

<P>folks, Henry.&nbsp; I don't want yeh to ever do any-

<P>thing, Henry, that yeh would be 'shamed to let

<P>me know about.&nbsp; Jest think as if I was a-watchin'

<P>yeh.&nbsp; If yeh keep that in yer mind allus, I guess

<P>yeh'll come out about right.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh must allus remember yer father, too,

<P>child, an' remember he never drunk a drop of

<P>licker in his life, and seldom swore a cross oath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I don't know what else to tell yeh, Henry,

<P>excepting that yeh must never do no shirking,

<P>child, on my account.&nbsp; If so be a time comes when

<P>yeh have to be kilt or do a mean thing, why,

<P>Henry, don't think of anything 'cept what's right,

<P>because there's many a woman has to bear up

<P>'ginst sech things these times, and the Lord 'll

<P>take keer of us all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't forgit about the socks and the shirts,

<P>child; and I've put a cup of blackberry jam with

<P>yer bundle, because I know yeh like it above all

<P>things.&nbsp; Good-by, Henry.&nbsp; Watch out, and be a

<P>good boy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had, of course, been impatient under the

<P>ordeal of this speech.&nbsp; It had not been quite what

<P>he expected, and he had borne it with an air of

<P>irritation.&nbsp; He departed feeling vague relief.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Still, when he had looked back from the gate,

<P>he had seen his mother kneeling among the po-

<P>tato parings.&nbsp; Her brown face, upraised, was

<P>stained with tears, and her spare form was quiver-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>10 RED BADGE OF COURAGE.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>ing.&nbsp; He bowed his head and went on, feeling

<P>suddenly ashamed of his purposes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From his home he had gone to the seminary

<P>to bid adieu to many schoolmates.&nbsp; They had

<P>thronged about him with wonder and admiration.

<P>He had felt the gulf now between them and had

<P>swelled with calm pride.&nbsp; He and some of his

<P>fellows who had donned blue were quite over-

<P>whelmed with privileges for all of one afternoon,

<P>and it had been a very delicious thing.&nbsp; They had

<P>strutted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A certain light-haired girl had made vivacious

<P>fun at his martial spirit, but there was another and

<P>darker girl whom he had gazed at steadfastly, and

<P>he thought she grew demure and sad at sight of

<P>his blue and brass.&nbsp; As he had walked down the

<P>path between the rows of oaks, he had turned his

<P>head and detected her at a window watching his

<P>departure.&nbsp; As he perceived her, she had im-

<P>mediately begun to stare up through the high

<P>tree branches at the sky.&nbsp; He had seen a good

<P>deal of flurry and haste in her movement as she

<P>changed her attitude.&nbsp; He often thought of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the way to Washington his spirit had

<P>soared.&nbsp; The regiment was fed and caressed at

<P>station after station until the youth had believed

<P>that he must be a hero.&nbsp; There was a lavish ex-

<P>penditure of bread and cold meats, coffee, and

<P>pickles and cheese.&nbsp; As he basked in the smiles

<P>of the girls and was patted and complimented by

<P>the old men, he had felt growing within him the

<P>strength to do mighty deeds of arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After complicated journeyings with many

<P>pauses, there had come months of monotonous

<P>life in a camp.&nbsp; He had had the belief that real

<P>war was a series of death struggles with small

<P>time in between for sleep and meals; but since his

<P>regiment had come to the field the army had done

<P>little but sit still and try to keep warm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was brought then gradually back to his old

<P>ideas.&nbsp; Greeklike struggles would be no more.

<P>Men were better, or more timid.&nbsp; Secular and

<P>religious education had effaced the throat-grap-

<P>pling instinct, or else firm finance held in check

<P>the passions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had grown to regard himself merely as a

<P>part of a vast blue demonstration.&nbsp; His province

<P>was to look out, as far as he could, for his per-

<P>sonal comfort.&nbsp; For recreation he could twiddle

<P>his thumbs and speculate on the thoughts which

<P>must agitate the minds of the generals.&nbsp; Also, he

<P>was drilled and drilled and reviewed, and drilled

<P>and drilled and reviewed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The only foes he had seen were some pickets

<P>along the river bank.&nbsp; They were a sun-tanned,

<P>philosophical lot, who sometimes shot reflectively

<P>at the blue pickets.&nbsp; When reproached for this

<P>afterward, they usually expressed sorrow, and

<P>swore by their gods that the guns had exploded

<P>without their permission.&nbsp; The youth, on guard

<P>duty one night, conversed across the stream with

<P>one of them.&nbsp; He was a slightly ragged man, who

<P>spat skillfully between his shoes and possessed a

<P>great fund of bland and infantile assurance.&nbsp; The

<P>youth liked him personally.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yank," the other had informed him, "yer a

<P>right dum good feller."&nbsp; This sentiment, floating

<P>to him upon the still air, had made him tempo-

<P>rarily regret war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Various veterans had told him tales.&nbsp; Some

<P>talked of gray, bewhiskered hordes who were

<P>advancing with relentless curses and chewing

<P>tobacco with unspeakable valor; tremendous

<P>bodies of fierce soldiery who were sweeping

<P>along like the Huns.&nbsp; Others spoke of tattered

<P>and eternally hungry men who fired despondent

<P>powders.&nbsp; "They'll charge through hell's fire an'

<P>brimstone t' git a holt on a haversack, an' sech

<P>stomachs ain't a-lastin' long," he was told.&nbsp; From

<P>the stories, the youth imagined the red, live bones

<P>sticking out through slits in the faded uniforms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Still, he could not put a whole faith in veter-

<P>ans' tales, for recruits were their prey.&nbsp; They

<P>talked much of smoke, fire, and blood, but he

<P>could not tell how much might be lies.&nbsp; They

<P>persistently yelled "Fresh fish!" at him, and were

<P>in no wise to be trusted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However, he perceived now that it did not

<P>greatly matter what kind of soldiers he was going

<P>to fight, so long as they fought, which fact no one

<P>disputed.&nbsp; There was a more serious problem.&nbsp; He

<P>lay in his bunk pondering upon it.&nbsp; He tried to

<P>mathematically prove to himself that he would

<P>not run from a battle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Previously he had never felt obliged to wrestle

<P>too seriously with this question.&nbsp; In his life he had

<P>taken certain things for granted, never challeng-

<P>ing his belief in ultimate success, and bothering

<P>little about means and roads.&nbsp; But here he was

<P>confronted with a thing of moment.&nbsp; It had sud-

<P>denly appeared to him that perhaps in a battle he

<P>might run.&nbsp; He was forced to admit that as far as

<P>war was concerned he knew nothing of himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A sufficient time before he would have allowed

<P>the problem to kick its heels at the outer portals

<P>of his mind, but now he felt compelled to give

<P>serious attention to it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A little panic-fear grew in his mind.&nbsp; As his

<P>imagination went forward to a fight, he saw hide-

<P>ous possibilities.&nbsp; He contemplated the lurking

<P>menaces of the future, and failed in an effort to

<P>see himself standing stoutly in the midst of them.

<P>He recalled his visions of broken-bladed glory,

<P>but in the shadow of the impending tumult he

<P>suspected them to be impossible pictures.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He sprang from the bunk and began to pace

<P>nervously to and fro.&nbsp; "Good Lord, what's th'

<P>matter with me?" he said aloud.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He felt that in this crisis his laws of life were

<P>useless.&nbsp; Whatever he had learned of himself was

<P>here of no avail.&nbsp; He was an unknown quantity.

<P>He saw that he would again be obliged to experi-

<P>ment as he had in early youth.&nbsp; He must accumu-

<P>late information of himself, and meanwhile he re-

<P>solved to remain close upon his guard lest those

<P>qualities of which he knew nothing should ever-

<P>lastingly disgrace him.&nbsp; "Good Lord!" he re-

<P>peated in dismay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time the tall soldier slid dexterously

<P>through the hole.&nbsp; The loud private followed.

<P>They were wrangling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's all right," said the tall soldier as he

<P>entered.&nbsp; He waved his hand expressively.&nbsp; "You

<P>can believe me or not, jest as you like.&nbsp; All you

<P>got to do is to sit down and wait as quiet as you

<P>can.&nbsp; Then pretty soon you'll find out I was right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His comrade grunted stubbornly.&nbsp; For a mo-

<P>ment he seemed to be searching for a formidable

<P>reply.&nbsp; Finally he said: "Well, you don't know

<P>everything in the world, do you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Didn't say I knew everything in the world,"

<P>retorted the other sharply.&nbsp; He began to stow

<P>various articles snugly into his knapsack.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth, pausing in his nervous walk, looked

<P>down at the busy figure.&nbsp; "Going to be a battle,

<P>sure, is there, Jim?" he asked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Of course there is," replied the tall soldier.

<P>"Of course there is.&nbsp; You jest wait 'til to-morrow,

<P>and you'll see one of the biggest battles ever was.

<P>You jest wait."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thunder!der!" said the youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, you'll see fighting this time, my boy,

<P>what'll be regular out-and-out fighting," added

<P>the tall soldier, with the air of a man who is

<P>about to exhibit a battle for the benefit of his

<P>friends.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Huh!" said the loud one from a corner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," remarked the youth, "like as not this

<P>story'll turn out jest like them others did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not much it won't," replied the tall soldier,

<P>exasperated.&nbsp; "Not much it won't.&nbsp; Didn't the

<P>cavalry all start this morning?"&nbsp; He glared about

<P>him.&nbsp; No one denied his statement.&nbsp; "The cav-

<P>alry started this morning," he continued.&nbsp; "They

<P>say there ain't hardly any cavalry left in camp.

<P>They're going to Richmond, or some place, while

<P>we fight all the Johnnies.&nbsp; It's some dodge like

<P>that.&nbsp; The regiment's got orders, too.&nbsp; A feller

<P>what seen 'em go to headquarters told me a little

<P>while ago.&nbsp; And they're raising blazes all over

<P>camp--anybody can see that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shucks!" said the loud one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth remained silent for a time.&nbsp; At last

<P>he spoke to the tall soldier.&nbsp; "Jim!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How do you think the reg'ment 'll do?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, they'll fight all right, I guess, after they

<P>once get into it," said the other with cold judg-

<P>ment.&nbsp; He made a fine use of the third person.

<P>"There's been heaps of fun poked at 'em because

<P>they're new, of course, and all that; but they'll

<P>fight all right, I guess."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Think any of the boys 'll run?" persisted the

<P>youth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, there may be a few of 'em run, but

<P>there's them kind in every regiment, 'specially

<P>when they first goes under fire," said the other

<P>in a tolerant way.&nbsp; "Of course it might happen

<P>that the hull kit-and-boodle might start and run,

<P>if some big fighting came first-off, and then again

<P>they might stay and fight like fun.&nbsp; But you can't

<P>bet on nothing.&nbsp; Of course they ain't never been

<P>under fire yet, and it ain't likely they'll lick the

<P>hull rebel army all-to-oncet the first time; but I

<P>think they'll fight better than some, if worse than

<P>others.&nbsp; That's the way I figger.&nbsp; They call the

<P>reg'ment 'Fresh fish' and everything; but the

<P>boys come of good stock, and most of 'em 'll fight

<P>like sin after they oncet git shootin'," he added,

<P>with a mighty emphasis on the last four words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, you think you know--" began the loud

<P>soldier with scorn.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The other turned savagely upon him.&nbsp; They

<P>had a rapid altercation, in which they fastened

<P>upon each other various strange epithets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth at last interrupted them.&nbsp; "Did

<P>you ever think you might run yourself, Jim?" he

<P>asked.&nbsp; On concluding the sentence he laughed

<P>as if he had meant to aim a joke.&nbsp; The loud sol-

<P>dier also giggled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tall private waved his hand.&nbsp; "Well," said

<P>he profoundly, "I've thought it might get too hot

<P>for Jim Conklin in some of them scrimmages, and

<P>if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, I

<P>s'pose I'd start and run.&nbsp; And if I once started to

<P>run, I'd run like the devil, and no mistake.&nbsp; But

<P>if everybody was a-standing and a-fighting, why,

<P>I'd stand and fight.&nbsp; Be jiminey, I would.&nbsp; I'll

<P>bet on it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Huh!" said the loud one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The youth of this tale felt gratitude for these

<P>words of his comrade.&nbsp; He had feared that all of

<P>the untried men possessed a great and correct

<P>confidence.&nbsp; He now was in a measure reassured.
