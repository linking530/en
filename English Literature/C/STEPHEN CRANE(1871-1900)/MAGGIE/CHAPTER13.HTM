<P>Jimmie did not return home for a number of days after the

<P>fight with Pete in the saloon.&nbsp; When he did, he approached with

<P>extreme caution.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He found his mother raving.&nbsp; Maggie had not returned home.

<P>The parent continually wondered how her daughter could come to such

<P>a pass.&nbsp; She had never considered Maggie as a pearl dropped

<P>unstained into Rum Alley from Heaven, but she could not conceive

<P>how it was possible for her daughter to fall so low as to bring

<P>disgrace upon her family.&nbsp; She was terrific in denunciation of
the

<P>girl's wickedness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The fact that the neighbors talked of it, maddened her.&nbsp; When

<P>women came in, and in the course of their conversation casually

<P>asked, "Where's Maggie dese days?" the mother shook her fuzzy head

<P>at them and appalled them with curses.&nbsp; Cunning hints inviting

<P>confidence she rebuffed with violence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"An' wid all deh bringin' up she had, how could she?"

<P>moaningly she asked of her son.&nbsp; "Wid all deh talkin' wid her I
did

<P>an' deh t'ings I tol' her to remember?&nbsp; When a girl is bringed
up

<P>deh way I bringed up Maggie, how kin she go teh deh devil?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie was transfixed by these questions.&nbsp; He could not

<P>conceive how under the circumstances his mother's daughter and his

<P>sister could have been so wicked.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His mother took a drink from a squdgy bottle that sat on the

<P>table.&nbsp; She continued her lament.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She had a bad heart, dat girl did, Jimmie.&nbsp; She was wicked

<P>teh deh heart an' we never knowed it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie nodded, admitting the fact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We lived in deh same house wid her an' I brought her up an'

<P>we never knowed how bad she was."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie nodded again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Wid a home like dis an' a mudder like me, she went teh deh

<P>bad," cried the mother, raising her eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One day, Jimmie came home, sat down in a chair and began to

<P>wriggle about with a new and strange nervousness.&nbsp; At last he spoke

<P>shamefacedly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, look-a-here, dis t'ing queers us!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; We're queered!

<P>An' maybe it 'ud be better if I--well, I t'ink I kin look 'er up

<P>an'--maybe it 'ud be better if I fetched her home an'--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother started from her chair and broke forth into a storm

<P>of passionate anger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!&nbsp; Let 'er come an' sleep under deh same roof wid her

<P>mudder agin!&nbsp; Oh, yes, I will, won't I?&nbsp; Sure?&nbsp; Shame
on yehs,

<P>Jimmie Johnson, for sayin' such a t'ing teh yer own mudder--teh yer

<P>own mudder!&nbsp; Little did I t'ink when yehs was a babby playin' about

<P>me feet dat ye'd grow up teh say sech a t'ing teh yer mudder--yer

<P>own mudder.&nbsp; I never taut--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sobs choked her and interrupted her reproaches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dere ain't nottin' teh raise sech hell about," said Jimmie.

<P>"I on'y says it 'ud be better if we keep dis t'ing dark, see?

<P>It queers us!&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His mother laughed a laugh that seemed to ring through the

<P>city and be echoed and re-echoed by countless other laughs.

<P>"Oh, yes, I will, won't I!&nbsp; Sure!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, yeh must take me fer a damn fool," said Jimmie,

<P>indignant at his mother for mocking him.&nbsp; "I didn't say we'd make

<P>'er inteh a little tin angel, ner nottin', but deh way it is now

<P>she can queer us!&nbsp; Don' che see?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, she'll git tired of deh life atter a while an' den

<P>she'll wanna be a-comin' home, won' she, deh beast!&nbsp; I'll let 'er

<P>in den, won' I?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I didn' mean none of dis prod'gal bus'ness anyway,"

<P>explained Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It wasn't no prod'gal dauter, yeh damn fool," said the

<P>mother.&nbsp; "It was prod'gal son, anyhow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know dat," said Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a time they sat in silence.&nbsp; The mother's eyes gloated on

<P>a scene her imagination could call before her.&nbsp; Her lips were set

<P>in a vindictive smile.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Aye, she'll cry, won' she, an' carry on, an' tell how Pete,

<P>or some odder feller, beats 'er an' she'll say she's sorry an' all

<P>dat an' she ain't happy, she ain't, an' she wants to come home agin,

<P>she does."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With grim humor, the mother imitated the possible wailing

<P>notes of the daughter's voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Den I'll take 'er in, won't I, deh beast.&nbsp; She kin cry 'er two
eyes out

<P>on deh stones of deh street before I'll dirty deh place wid her.

<P>She abused an' ill-treated her own mudder--her own mudder what

<P>loved her an' she'll never git anodder chance dis side of hell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie thought he had a great idea of women's frailty, but he

<P>could not understand why any of his kin should be victims.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Damn her," he fervidly said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again he wondered vaguely if some of the women of his acquaintance

<P>had brothers.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his mind did not for an instant

<P>confuse himself with those brothers nor his sister with theirs.

<P>After the mother had, with great difficulty, suppressed the

<P>neighbors, she went among them and proclaimed her grief.

<P>"May Gawd forgive dat girl," was her continual cry.&nbsp; To attentive

<P>ears she recited the whole length and breadth of her woes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I bringed 'er up deh way a dauter oughta be bringed up an'

<P>dis is how she served me!&nbsp; She went teh deh devil deh first chance

<P>she got!&nbsp; May Gawd forgive her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When arrested for drunkenness she used the story of her

<P>daughter's downfall with telling effect upon the police justices.

<P>Finally one of them said to her, peering down over his spectacles:

<P>"Mary, the records of this and other courts show that you are the

<P>mother of forty-two daughters who have been ruined.&nbsp; The case

<P>is unparalleled in the annals of this court, and this court

<P>thinks--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother went through life shedding large tears of sorrow.

<P>Her red face was a picture of agony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of course Jimmie publicly damned his sister that he might

<P>appear on a higher social plane.&nbsp; But, arguing with himself,

<P>stumbling about in ways that he knew not, he, once, almost came to

<P>a conclusion that his sister would have been more firmly good had

<P>she better known why.&nbsp; However, he felt that he could not hold
such

<P>a view.&nbsp; He threw it hastily aside.
