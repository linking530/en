<P>On a corner a glass-fronted building shed a yellow glare upon

<P>the pavements.&nbsp; The open mouth of a saloon called seductively to

<P>passengers to enter and annihilate sorrow or create rage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The interior of the place was papered in olive and bronze tints

<P>of imitation leather.&nbsp; A shining bar of counterfeit massiveness

<P>extended down the side of the room.&nbsp; Behind it a great

<P>mahogany-appearing sideboard reached the ceiling.&nbsp; Upon its

<P>shelves rested pyramids of shimmering glasses that were never

<P>disturbed.&nbsp; Mirrors set in the face of the sideboard multiplied

<P>them.&nbsp; Lemons, oranges and paper napkins, arranged with

<P>mathematical precision, sat among the glasses.&nbsp; Many-hued decanters

<P>of liquor perched at regular intervals on the lower shelves.

<P>A nickel-plated cash register occupied a position in the exact

<P>centre of the general effect.&nbsp; The elementary senses of it all

<P>seemed to be opulence and geometrical accuracy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Across from the bar a smaller counter held a collection of plates

<P>upon which swarmed frayed fragments of crackers, slices of boiled ham,

<P>dishevelled bits of cheese, and pickles swimming in vinegar.

<P>An odor of grasping, begrimed hands and munching mouths pervaded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete, in a white jacket, was behind the bar bending

<P>expectantly toward a quiet stranger.&nbsp; "A beeh," said the man.

<P>Pete drew a foam-topped glassful and set it dripping upon the bar.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this moment the light bamboo doors at the entrance swung

<P>open and crashed against the siding.&nbsp; Jimmie and a companion

<P>entered.&nbsp; They swaggered unsteadily but belligerently toward the

<P>bar and looked at Pete with bleared and blinking eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gin," said Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gin," said the companion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete slid a bottle and two glasses along the bar.&nbsp; He bended

<P>his head sideways as he assiduously polished away with a napkin at

<P>the gleaming wood.&nbsp; He had a look of watchfulness upon his

<P>features.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie and his companion kept their eyes upon the bartender

<P>and conversed loudly in tones of contempt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He's a dindy masher, ain't he, by Gawd?" laughed Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, hell, yes," said the companion, sneering widely.&nbsp; "He's

<P>great, he is.&nbsp; Git onto deh mug on deh blokie.&nbsp; Dat's enough
to

<P>make a feller turn hand-springs in 'is sleep."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quiet stranger moved himself and his glass a trifle

<P>further away and maintained an attitude of oblivion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gee! ain't he hot stuff!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Git onto his shape!&nbsp; Great Gawd!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hey," cried Jimmie, in tones of command.&nbsp; Pete came along

<P>slowly, with a sullen dropping of the under lip.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," he growled, "what's eatin' yehs?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gin," said Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gin," said the companion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Pete confronted them with the bottle and the glasses, they

<P>laughed in his face.&nbsp; Jimmie's companion, evidently overcome with

<P>merriment, pointed a grimy forefinger in Pete's direction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, Jimmie," demanded he, "what deh hell is dat behind deh

<P>bar?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie.&nbsp; They laughed loudly.

<P>Pete put down a bottle with a bang and turned a formidable face

<P>toward them.&nbsp; He disclosed his teeth and his shoulders heaved

<P>restlessly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You fellers can't guy me," he said.&nbsp; "Drink yer stuff an' git

<P>out an' don' make no trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Instantly the laughter faded from the faces of the two men and

<P>expressions of offended dignity immediately came.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Who deh hell has said anyt'ing teh you," cried they in the

<P>same breath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quiet stranger looked at the door calculatingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, come off," said Pete to the two men.&nbsp; "Don't pick me up

<P>for no jay.&nbsp; Drink yer rum an' git out an' don' make no trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, deh hell," airily cried Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, deh hell," airily repeated his companion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We goes when we git ready!&nbsp; See!" continued Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Pete in a threatening voice, "don' make no

<P>trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie suddenly leaned forward with his head on one side.

<P>He snarled like a wild animal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, what if we does?&nbsp; See?" said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dark blood flushed into Pete's face, and he shot a lurid

<P>glance at Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, den we'll see whose deh bes' man, you or me," he said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quiet stranger moved modestly toward the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie began to swell with valor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don' pick me up fer no tenderfoot.&nbsp; When yeh tackles me yeh

<P>tackles one of deh bes' men in deh city.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I'm a scrapper,

<P>I am.&nbsp; Ain't dat right, Billie?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure, Mike," responded his companion in tones of conviction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, hell," said Pete, easily.&nbsp; "Go fall on yerself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two men again began to laugh.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell is dat talkin'?" cried the companion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie with exaggerated contempt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete made a furious gesture.&nbsp; "Git outa here now, an' don' make

<P>no trouble.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Youse fellers er lookin' fer a scrap an'
it's

<P>damn likely yeh'll fin' one if yeh keeps on shootin' off yer mout's.

<P>I know yehs!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I kin lick better men dan yehs ever saw
in yer lifes.

<P>Dat's right!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Don' pick me up fer no stuff er yeh might
be jolted

<P>out in deh street before yeh knows where yeh is.&nbsp; When I comes
from behind

<P>dis bar, I t'rows yehs bote inteh deh street.&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, hell," cried the two men in chorus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The glare of a panther came into Pete's eyes.&nbsp; "Dat's what I said!

<P>Unnerstan'?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He came through a passage at the end of the bar and swelled down upon

<P>the two men.&nbsp; They stepped promptly forward and crowded close to
him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They bristled like three roosters.&nbsp; They moved their heads

<P>pugnaciously and kept their shoulders braced.&nbsp; The nervous muscles

<P>about each mouth twitched with a forced smile of mockery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, what deh hell yer goin' teh do?" gritted Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete stepped warily back, waving his hands before him to keep

<P>the men from coming too near.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, what deh hell yer goin' teh do?" repeated Jimmie's ally.

<P>They kept close to him, taunting and leering.&nbsp; They strove

<P>to make him attempt the initial blow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Keep back, now!&nbsp; Don' crowd me," ominously said Pete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Again they chorused in contempt.&nbsp; "Oh, hell!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a small, tossing group, the three men edged for positions

<P>like frigates contemplating battle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, why deh hell don' yeh try teh t'row us out?" cried Jimmie

<P>and his ally with copious sneers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The bravery of bull-dogs sat upon the faces of the men.

<P>Their clenched fists moved like eager weapons.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The allied two jostled the bartender's elbows, glaring at him

<P>with feverish eyes and forcing him toward the wall.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly Pete swore redly.&nbsp; The flash of action gleamed from

<P>his eyes.&nbsp; He threw back his arm and aimed a tremendous, lightning-

<P>like blow at Jimmie's face.&nbsp; His foot swung a step forward and
the

<P>weight of his body was behind his fist.&nbsp; Jimmie ducked his head,

<P>Bowery-like, with the quickness of a cat.&nbsp; The fierce, answering

<P>blows of him and his ally crushed on Pete's bowed head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quiet stranger vanished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The arms of the combatants whirled in the air like flails.

<P>The faces of the men, at first flushed to flame-colored anger, now

<P>began to fade to the pallor of warriors in the blood and heat of a

<P>battle.&nbsp; Their lips curled back and stretched tightly over the
gums

<P>in ghoul-like grins.&nbsp; Through their white, gripped teeth struggled

<P>hoarse whisperings of oaths.&nbsp; Their eyes glittered with murderous
fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Each head was huddled between its owner's shoulders, and arms

<P>were swinging with marvelous rapidity.&nbsp; Feet scraped to and fro

<P>with a loud scratching sound upon the sanded floor.&nbsp; Blows left

<P>crimson blotches upon pale skin.&nbsp; The curses of the first quarter

<P>minute of the fight died away.&nbsp; The breaths of the fighters came

<P>wheezingly from their lips and the three chests were straining and

<P>heaving.&nbsp; Pete at intervals gave vent to low, labored hisses, that

<P>sounded like a desire to kill.&nbsp; Jimmie's ally gibbered at times
like

<P>a wounded maniac.&nbsp; Jimmie was silent, fighting with the face

<P>of a sacrificial priest.&nbsp; The rage of fear shone in all their

<P>eyes and their blood-colored fists swirled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At a tottering moment a blow from Pete's hand struck the ally

<P>and he crashed to the floor.&nbsp; He wriggled instantly to his feet
and

<P>grasping the quiet stranger's beer glass from the bar, hurled it at

<P>Pete's head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>High on the wall it burst like a bomb, shivering fragments

<P>flying in all directions.&nbsp; Then missiles came to every man's hand.

<P>The place had heretofore appeared free of things to throw, but

<P>suddenly glass and bottles went singing through the air.&nbsp; They
were

<P>thrown point blank at bobbing heads.&nbsp; The pyramid of shimmering

<P>glasses, that had never been disturbed, changed to cascades as

<P>heavy bottles were flung into them.&nbsp; Mirrors splintered to nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The three frothing creatures on the floor buried themselves in

<P>a frenzy for blood.&nbsp; There followed in the wake of missiles and

<P>fists some unknown prayers, perhaps for death.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The quiet stranger had sprawled very pyrotechnically out on

<P>the sidewalk.&nbsp; A laugh ran up and down the avenue for the half

<P>of a block.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dey've trowed a bloke inteh deh street."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>People heard the sound of breaking glass and shuffling feet

<P>within the saloon and came running.&nbsp; A small group, bending down
to

<P>look under the bamboo doors, watching the fall of glass, and three

<P>pairs of violent legs, changed in a moment to a crowd.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A policeman came charging down the sidewalk and bounced

<P>through the doors into the saloon.&nbsp; The crowd bended and surged
in

<P>absorbing anxiety to see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie caught first sight of the on-coming interruption.&nbsp; On his
feet

<P>he had the same regard for a policeman that, when on his truck,

<P>he had for a fire engine.&nbsp; He howled and ran for the side door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The officer made a terrific advance, club in hand.&nbsp; One comprehensive

<P>sweep of the long night stick threw the ally to the floor and forced

<P>Pete to a corner.&nbsp; With his disengaged hand he made a furious effort

<P>at Jimmie's coat-tails.&nbsp; Then he regained his balance and paused.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, you are a pair of pictures.&nbsp; What in hell yeh

<P>been up to?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie, with his face drenched in blood, escaped up a side street,

<P>pursued a short distance by some of the more law-loving, or excited

<P>individuals of the crowd.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Later, from a corner safely dark, he saw the policeman, the

<P>ally and the bartender emerge from the saloon.&nbsp; Pete locked the

<P>doors and then followed up the avenue in the rear of the crowd-

<P>encompassed policeman and his charge.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On first thoughts Jimmie, with his heart throbbing at battle heat,

<P>started to go desperately to the rescue of his friend, but he halted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what deh hell?" he demanded of himself.
