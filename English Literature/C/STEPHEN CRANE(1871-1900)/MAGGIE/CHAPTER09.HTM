<P>A group of urchins were intent upon the side door of a saloon.

<P>Expectancy gleamed from their eyes.&nbsp; They were twisting their

<P>fingers in excitement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here she comes," yelled one of them suddenly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The group of urchins burst instantly asunder and its

<P>individual fragments were spread in a wide, respectable half circle

<P>about the point of interest.&nbsp; The saloon door opened with a crash,

<P>and the figure of a woman appeared upon the threshold.&nbsp; Her grey

<P>hair fell in knotted masses about her shoulders.&nbsp; Her face was

<P>crimsoned and wet with perspiration.&nbsp; Her eyes had a rolling glare.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a damn cent more of me money will yehs ever get, not a damn cent.

<P>I spent me money here fer t'ree years an' now yehs tells me yeh'll

<P>sell me no more stuff!&nbsp; T'hell wid yeh, Johnnie Murckre!&nbsp;
'Disturbance'?

<P>Disturbance be damned!&nbsp; T'hell wid yeh, Johnnie--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The door received a kick of exasperation from within and the

<P>woman lurched heavily out on the sidewalk.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The gamins in the half-circle became violently agitated.

<P>They began to dance about and hoot and yell and jeer.

<P>Wide dirty grins spread over each face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman made a furious dash at a particularly outrageous

<P>cluster of little boys.&nbsp; They laughed delightedly and scampered
off

<P>a short distance, calling out over their shoulders to her.&nbsp; She

<P>stood tottering on the curb-stone and thundered at them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh devil's kids," she howled, shaking red fists.&nbsp; The little
boys

<P>whooped in glee.&nbsp; As she started up the street they fell in behind

<P>and marched uproariously.&nbsp; Occasionally she wheeled about and made

<P>charges on them.&nbsp; They ran nimbly out of reach and taunted her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the frame of a gruesome doorway she stood for a moment cursing them.

<P>Her hair straggled, giving her crimson features a look of insanity.

<P>Her great fists quivered as she shook them madly in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The urchins made terrific noises until she turned and

<P>disappeared.&nbsp; Then they filed quietly in the way they had come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman floundered about in the lower hall of the tenement house

<P>and finally stumbled up the stairs.&nbsp; On an upper hall a door was

<P>opened and a collection of heads peered curiously out, watching her.

<P>With a wrathful snort the woman confronted the door, but it was

<P>slammed hastily in her face and the key was turned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stood for a few minutes, delivering a frenzied challenge at the
panels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come out in deh hall, Mary Murphy, damn yeh, if yehs want a row.

<P>Come ahn, yeh overgrown terrier, come ahn."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She began to kick the door with her great feet.&nbsp; She shrilly

<P>defied the universe to appear and do battle.&nbsp; Her cursing trebles

<P>brought heads from all doors save the one she threatened.&nbsp; Her
eyes

<P>glared in every direction.&nbsp; The air was full of her tossing fists.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come ahn, deh hull damn gang of yehs, come ahn," she roared at

<P>the spectators.&nbsp; An oath or two, cat-calls, jeers and bits of

<P>facetious advice were given in reply.&nbsp; Missiles clattered

<P>about her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell's deh matter wid yeh?" said a voice in the

<P>gathered gloom, and Jimmie came forward.&nbsp; He carried a tin dinner-

<P>pail in his hand and under his arm a brown truckman's apron done in

<P>a bundle.&nbsp; "What deh hell's wrong?" he demanded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come out, all of yehs, come out," his mother was howling.

<P>"Come ahn an' I'll stamp her damn brains under me feet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Shet yer face, an' come home, yeh damned old fool," roared

<P>Jimmie at her.&nbsp; She strided up to him and twirled her fingers in

<P>his face.&nbsp; Her eyes were darting flames of unreasoning rage and
her

<P>frame trembled with eagerness for a fight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"T'hell wid yehs!&nbsp; An' who deh hell are yehs?&nbsp; I ain't givin'
a snap

<P>of me fingers fer yehs," she bawled at him.&nbsp; She turned her huge
back

<P>in tremendous disdain and climbed the stairs to the next floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie followed, cursing blackly.&nbsp; At the top of the flight he

<P>seized his mother's arm and started to drag her toward the door of

<P>their room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come home, damn yeh," he gritted between his teeth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Take yer hands off me!&nbsp; Take yer hands off me," shrieked his mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She raised her arm and whirled her great fist at her son's

<P>face.&nbsp; Jimmie dodged his head and the blow struck him in the back

<P>of the neck.&nbsp; "Damn yeh," gritted he again.&nbsp; He threw out
his left

<P>hand and writhed his fingers about her middle arm.&nbsp; The mother
and

<P>the son began to sway and struggle like gladiators.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whoop!" said the Rum Alley tenement house.&nbsp; The hall filled

<P>with interested spectators.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hi, ol' lady, dat was a dandy!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"T'ree to one on deh red!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, stop yer damn scrappin'!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The door of the Johnson home opened and Maggie looked out.

<P>Jimmie made a supreme cursing effort and hurled his mother

<P>into the room.&nbsp; He quickly followed and closed the door.

<P>The Rum Alley tenement swore disappointedly and retired.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother slowly gathered herself up from the floor.

<P>Her eyes glittered menacingly upon her children.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here, now," said Jimmie, "we've had enough of dis.&nbsp; Sit down,

<P>an' don' make no trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He grasped her arm, and twisting it, forced her into a

<P>creaking chair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Keep yer hands off me," roared his mother again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Damn yer ol' hide," yelled Jimmie, madly.&nbsp; Maggie shrieked

<P>and ran into the other room.&nbsp; To her there came the sound of a

<P>storm of crashes and curses.&nbsp; There was a great final thump and

<P>Jimmie's voice cried: "Dere, damn yeh, stay still."&nbsp; Maggie opened

<P>the door now, and went warily out.&nbsp; "Oh, Jimmie."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was leaning against the wall and swearing.&nbsp; Blood stood

<P>upon bruises on his knotty fore-arms where they had scraped against

<P>the floor or the walls in the scuffle.&nbsp; The mother lay screeching

<P>on the floor, the tears running down her furrowed face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie, standing in the middle of the room, gazed about her.

<P>The usual upheaval of the tables and chairs had taken place.

<P>Crockery was strewn broadcast in fragments.&nbsp; The stove had been

<P>disturbed on its legs, and now leaned idiotically to one side.

<P>A pail had been upset and water spread in all directions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The door opened and Pete appeared.&nbsp; He shrugged his shoulders.

<P>"Oh, Gawd," he observed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He walked over to Maggie and whispered in her ear.&nbsp; "Ah, what

<P>deh hell, Mag?&nbsp; Come ahn and we'll have a hell of a time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother in the corner upreared her head and shook her

<P>tangled locks.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Teh hell wid him and you," she said, glowering at her

<P>daughter in the gloom.&nbsp; Her eyes seemed to burn balefully.&nbsp;
"Yeh've

<P>gone teh deh devil, Mag Johnson, yehs knows yehs have gone teh deh

<P>devil.&nbsp; Yer a disgrace teh yer people, damn yeh.&nbsp; An' now,
git out

<P>an' go ahn wid dat doe-faced jude of yours.&nbsp; Go teh hell wid him,

<P>damn yeh, an' a good riddance.&nbsp; Go teh hell an' see how yeh likes

<P>it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie gazed long at her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go teh hell now, an' see how yeh likes it.&nbsp; Git out.&nbsp; I won't

<P>have sech as yehs in me house!&nbsp; Get out, d'yeh hear!&nbsp; Damn
yeh,

<P>git out!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl began to tremble.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this instant Pete came forward.&nbsp; "Oh, what deh hell, Mag, see,"

<P>whispered he softly in her ear.&nbsp; "Dis all blows over.&nbsp; See?&nbsp;
Deh ol'

<P>woman 'ill be all right in deh mornin'.&nbsp; Come ahn out wid me!

<P>We'll have a hell of a time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman on the floor cursed.&nbsp; Jimmie was intent upon his

<P>bruised fore-arms.&nbsp; The girl cast a glance about the room filled
with

<P>a chaotic mass of debris, and at the red, writhing body of her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go teh hell an' good riddance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She went.
