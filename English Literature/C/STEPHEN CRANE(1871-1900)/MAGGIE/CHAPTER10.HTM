<P>Jimmie had an idea it wasn't common courtesy for a friend to

<P>come to one's home and ruin one's sister.&nbsp; But he was not sure
how

<P>much Pete knew about the rules of politeness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The following night he returned home from work at rather a

<P>late hour in the evening.&nbsp; In passing through the halls he came

<P>upon the gnarled and leathery old woman who possessed the music

<P>box.&nbsp; She was grinning in the dim light that drifted through dust-

<P>stained panes.&nbsp; She beckoned to him with a smudged forefinger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, Jimmie, what do yehs t'ink I got onto las' night.&nbsp; It was

<P>deh funnies' t'ing I ever saw," she cried, coming close to him and

<P>leering.&nbsp; She was trembling with eagerness to tell her tale.&nbsp;
"I

<P>was by me door las' night when yer sister and her jude feller came

<P>in late, oh, very late.&nbsp; An' she, the dear, she was a-cryin' as
if

<P>her heart would break, she was.&nbsp; It was deh funnies' t'ing I ever

<P>saw.&nbsp; An' right out here by me door she asked him did he love her,

<P>did he.&nbsp; An' she was a-cryin' as if her heart would break, poor

<P>t'ing.&nbsp; An' him, I could see by deh way what he said it dat she
had

<P>been askin' orften, he says: 'Oh, hell, yes,' he says, says he,

<P>'Oh, hell, yes.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Storm-clouds swept over Jimmie's face, but he turned from the

<P>leathery old woman and plodded on up-stairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, hell, yes," called she after him.&nbsp; She laughed a laugh

<P>that was like a prophetic croak.&nbsp; "'Oh, hell, yes,' he says, says

<P>he, 'Oh, hell, yes.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was no one in at home.&nbsp; The rooms showed that attempts

<P>had been made at tidying them.&nbsp; Parts of the wreckage of the day

<P>before had been repaired by an unskilful hand.&nbsp; A chair or two
and

<P>the table, stood uncertainly upon legs.&nbsp; The floor had been newly

<P>swept.&nbsp; Too, the blue ribbons had been restored to the curtains,

<P>and the lambrequin, with its immense sheaves of yellow wheat

<P>and red roses of equal size, had been returned, in a worn and sorry

<P>state, to its position at the mantel.&nbsp; Maggie's jacket and hat
were

<P>gone from the nail behind the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie walked to the window and began to look through the

<P>blurred glass.&nbsp; It occurred to him to vaguely wonder, for an

<P>instant, if some of the women of his acquaintance had brothers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly, however, he began to swear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But he was me frien'!&nbsp; I brought 'im here!&nbsp; Dat's deh hell
of it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He fumed about the room, his anger gradually rising to the

<P>furious pitch.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll kill deh jay!&nbsp; Dat's what I'll do!&nbsp; I'll kill deh jay!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He clutched his hat and sprang toward the door.&nbsp; But it opened

<P>and his mother's great form blocked the passage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell's deh matter wid yeh?" exclaimed she, coming

<P>into the rooms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie gave vent to a sardonic curse and then laughed heavily.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Maggie's gone teh deh devil!&nbsp; Dat's what!&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh?" said his mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Maggie's gone teh deh devil!&nbsp; Are yehs deaf?" roared Jimmie,

<P>impatiently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Deh hell she has," murmured the mother, astounded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie grunted, and then began to stare out at the window.

<P>His mother sat down in a chair, but a moment later sprang erect and

<P>delivered a maddened whirl of oaths.&nbsp; Her son turned to look at
her

<P>as she reeled and swayed in the middle of the room, her fierce face

<P>convulsed with passion, her blotched arms raised high in imprecation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May Gawd curse her forever," she shrieked.&nbsp; "May she eat

<P>nothin' but stones and deh dirt in deh street.&nbsp; May she sleep in

<P>deh gutter an' never see deh sun shine agin.&nbsp; Deh damn--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here, now," said her son.&nbsp; "Take a drop on yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother raised lamenting eyes to the ceiling.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's deh devil's own chil', Jimmie," she whispered.&nbsp; "Ah,

<P>who would t'ink such a bad girl could grow up in our fambly,

<P>Jimmie, me son.&nbsp; Many deh hour I've spent in talk wid dat girl
an'

<P>tol' her if she ever went on deh streets I'd see her damned.&nbsp; An'

<P>after all her bringin' up an' what I tol' her and talked wid her,

<P>she goes teh deh bad, like a duck teh water."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The tears rolled down her furrowed face.&nbsp; Her hands trembled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"An' den when dat Sadie MacMallister next door to us was sent

<P>teh deh devil by dat feller what worked in deh soap-factory,

<P>didn't I tell our Mag dat if she--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, dat's annuder story," interrupted the brother.&nbsp; "Of

<P>course, dat Sadie was nice an' all dat--but--see--it ain't dessame

<P>as if--well, Maggie was diff'ent--see--she was diff'ent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was trying to formulate a theory that he had always

<P>unconsciously held, that all sisters, excepting his own, could

<P>advisedly be ruined.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He suddenly broke out again.&nbsp; "I'll go t'ump hell outa deh mug

<P>what did her deh harm.&nbsp; I'll kill 'im!&nbsp; He t'inks he kin scrap,

<P>but when he gits me a-chasin' 'im he'll fin' out where he's wrong,

<P>deh damned duffer.&nbsp; I'll wipe up deh street wid 'im."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a fury he plunged out of the doorway.&nbsp; As he vanished the

<P>mother raised her head and lifted both hands, entreating.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"May Gawd curse her forever," she cried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the darkness of the hallway Jimmie discerned a knot of women

<P>talking volubly.&nbsp; When he strode by they paid no attention to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She allus was a bold thing," he heard one of them cry in an

<P>eager voice.&nbsp; "Dere wasn't a feller come teh deh house but she'd

<P>try teh mash 'im.&nbsp; My Annie says deh shameless t'ing tried teh

<P>ketch her feller, her own feller, what we useter know his fader."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I could a' tol' yehs dis two years ago," said a woman, in a

<P>key of triumph.&nbsp; "Yessir, it was over two years ago dat I says

<P>teh my ol' man, I says, 'Dat Johnson girl ain't straight,' I says.

<P>'Oh, hell,' he says.&nbsp; 'Oh, hell.'&nbsp; 'Dat's all right,' I says,

<P>'but I know what I knows,' I says, 'an' it 'ill come out later.

<P>You wait an' see,' I says, 'you see.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Anybody what had eyes could see dat dere was somethin' wrong

<P>wid dat girl.&nbsp; I didn't like her actions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the street Jimmie met a friend.&nbsp; "What deh hell?" asked the

<P>latter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie explained.&nbsp; "An' I'll t'ump 'im till he can't stand."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, what deh hell," said the friend.&nbsp; "What's deh use!

<P>Yeh'll git pulled in!&nbsp; Everybody 'ill be onto it!&nbsp; An' ten
plunks!

<P>Gee!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie was determined.&nbsp; "He t'inks he kin scrap, but he'll

<P>fin' out diff'ent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gee," remonstrated the friend.&nbsp; "What deh hell?"
