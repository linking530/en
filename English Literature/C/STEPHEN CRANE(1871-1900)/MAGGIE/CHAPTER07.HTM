<P>An orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men on an

<P>elevated stage near the centre of a great green-hued hall, played

<P>a popular waltz.&nbsp; The place was crowded with people grouped

<P>about little tables.&nbsp; A battalion of waiters slid among the throng,

<P>carrying trays of beer glasses and making change from the

<P>inexhaustible vaults of their trousers pockets.&nbsp; Little boys, in

<P>the costumes of French chefs, paraded up and down the irregular

<P>aisles vending fancy cakes.&nbsp; There was a low rumble of conversation

<P>and a subdued clinking of glasses.&nbsp; Clouds of tobacco smoke rolled

<P>and wavered high in air about the dull gilt of the chandeliers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The vast crowd had an air throughout of having just quitted

<P>labor.&nbsp; Men with calloused hands and attired in garments that

<P>showed the wear of an endless trudge for a living, smoked their

<P>pipes contentedly and spent five, ten, or perhaps fifteen cents for

<P>beer.&nbsp; There was a mere sprinkling of kid-gloved men who smoked

<P>cigars purchased elsewhere.&nbsp; The great body of the crowd was

<P>composed of people who showed that all day they strove with their

<P>hands.&nbsp; Quiet Germans, with maybe their wives and two or three

<P>children, sat listening to the music, with the expressions of happy

<P>cows.&nbsp; An occasional party of sailors from a war-ship, their faces

<P>pictures of sturdy health, spent the earlier hours of the evening

<P>at the small round tables.&nbsp; Very infrequent tipsy men, swollen
with

<P>the value of their opinions, engaged their companions in earnest

<P>and confidential conversation.&nbsp; In the balcony, and here and there

<P>below, shone the impassive faces of women.&nbsp; The nationalities of

<P>the Bowery beamed upon the stage from all directions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete aggressively walked up a side aisle and took seats with

<P>Maggie at a table beneath the balcony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Two beehs!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Leaning back he regarded with eyes of superiority the scene

<P>before them.&nbsp; This attitude affected Maggie strongly.&nbsp; A man
who

<P>could regard such a sight with indifference must be accustomed to

<P>very great things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was obvious that Pete had been to this place many times

<P>before, and was very familiar with it.&nbsp; A knowledge of this fact

<P>made Maggie feel little and new.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was extremely gracious and attentive.&nbsp; He displayed the

<P>consideration of a cultured gentleman who knew what was due.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, what deh hell?&nbsp; Bring deh lady a big glass!&nbsp; What deh

<P>hell use is dat pony?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Don't be fresh, now," said the waiter, with some warmth, as

<P>he departed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, git off deh eart'," said Pete, after the other's

<P>retreating form.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie perceived that Pete brought forth all his elegance and

<P>all his knowledge of high-class customs for her benefit.&nbsp; Her heart

<P>warmed as she reflected upon his condescension.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men gave

<P>vent to a few bars of anticipatory music and a girl, in a pink

<P>dress with short skirts, galloped upon the stage.&nbsp; She smiled upon

<P>the throng as if in acknowledgment of a warm welcome, and began to

<P>walk to and fro, making profuse gesticulations and singing, in

<P>brazen soprano tones, a song, the words of which were inaudible.

<P>When she broke into the swift rattling measures of a chorus some

<P>half-tipsy men near the stage joined in the rollicking refrain and

<P>glasses were pounded rhythmically upon the tables.&nbsp; People leaned

<P>forward to watch her and to try to catch the words of the song.

<P>When she vanished there were long rollings of applause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Obedient to more anticipatory bars, she reappeared amidst the

<P>half-suppressed cheering of the tipsy men.&nbsp; The orchestra plunged

<P>into dance music and the laces of the dancer fluttered and flew in

<P>the glare of gas jets.&nbsp; She divulged the fact that she was attired

<P>in some half dozen skirts.&nbsp; It was patent that any one of them

<P>would have proved adequate for the purpose for which skirts are

<P>intended.&nbsp; An occasional man bent forward, intent upon the pink

<P>stockings.&nbsp; Maggie wondered at the splendor of the costume and
lost

<P>herself in calculations of the cost of the silks and laces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The dancer's smile of stereotyped enthusiasm was turned for

<P>ten minutes upon the faces of her audience.&nbsp; In the finale she
fell

<P>into some of those grotesque attitudes which were at the time

<P>popular among the dancers in the theatres up-town, giving to the

<P>Bowery public the phantasies of the aristocratic theatre-going

<P>public, at reduced rates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, Pete," said Maggie, leaning forward, "dis is great."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure," said Pete, with proper complacence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A ventriloquist followed the dancer.&nbsp; He held two fantastic

<P>dolls on his knees.&nbsp; He made them sing mournful ditties and say

<P>funny things about geography and Ireland.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do dose little men talk?" asked Maggie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Naw," said Pete, "it's some damn fake.&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Two girls, on the bills as sisters, came forth and sang a duet

<P>that is heard occasionally at concerts given under church auspices.

<P>They supplemented it with a dance which of course can never

<P>be seen at concerts given under church auspices.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After the duettists had retired, a woman of debatable age sang

<P>a negro melody.&nbsp; The chorus necessitated some grotesque waddlings

<P>supposed to be an imitation of a plantation darkey, under the

<P>influence, probably, of music and the moon.&nbsp; The audience was just

<P>enthusiastic enough over it to have her return and sing a sorrowful

<P>lay, whose lines told of a mother's love and a sweetheart who

<P>waited and a young man who was lost at sea under the most harrowing

<P>circumstances.&nbsp; From the faces of a score or so in the crowd, the

<P>self-contained look faded.&nbsp; Many heads were bent forward with

<P>eagerness and sympathy.&nbsp; As the last distressing sentiment of the

<P>piece was brought forth, it was greeted by that kind of applause

<P>which rings as sincere.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As a final effort, the singer rendered some verses which

<P>described a vision of Britain being annihilated by America, and

<P>Ireland bursting her bonds.&nbsp; A carefully prepared crisis was

<P>reached in the last line of the last verse, where the singer threw

<P>out her arms and cried, "The star-spangled banner."&nbsp; Instantly
a

<P>great cheer swelled from the throats of the assemblage of the

<P>masses.&nbsp; There was a heavy rumble of booted feet thumping the

<P>floor.&nbsp; Eyes gleamed with sudden fire, and calloused hands waved

<P>frantically in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a few moments' rest, the orchestra played crashingly,

<P>and a small fat man burst out upon the stage.&nbsp; He began to roar
a

<P>song and stamp back and forth before the foot-lights, wildly waving

<P>a glossy silk hat and throwing leers, or smiles, broadcast.&nbsp; He

<P>made his face into fantastic grimaces until he looked like a

<P>pictured devil on a Japanese kite.&nbsp; The crowd laughed gleefully.

<P>His short, fat legs were never still a moment.&nbsp; He shouted and

<P>roared and bobbed his shock of red wig until the audience broke out

<P>in excited applause.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete did not pay much attention to the progress of events upon

<P>the stage.&nbsp; He was drinking beer and watching Maggie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her cheeks were blushing with excitement and her eyes were

<P>glistening.&nbsp; She drew deep breaths of pleasure.&nbsp; No thoughts
of the

<P>atmosphere of the collar and cuff factory came to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the orchestra crashed finally, they jostled their way to

<P>the sidewalk with the crowd.&nbsp; Pete took Maggie's arm and pushed
a

<P>way for her, offering to fight with a man or two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They reached Maggie's home at a late hour and stood for a

<P>moment in front of the gruesome doorway.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, Mag," said Pete, "give us a kiss for takin' yeh teh deh

<P>show, will yer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie laughed, as if startled, and drew away from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Naw, Pete," she said, "dat wasn't in it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what deh hell?" urged Pete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl retreated nervously.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what deh hell?" repeated he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie darted into the hall, and up the stairs.&nbsp; She turned

<P>and smiled at him, then disappeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete walked slowly down the street.&nbsp; He had something of an

<P>astonished expression upon his features.&nbsp; He paused under a lamp-

<P>post and breathed a low breath of surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gawd," he said, "I wonner if I've been played fer a duffer."
