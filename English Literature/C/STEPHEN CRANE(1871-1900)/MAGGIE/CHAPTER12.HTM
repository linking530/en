<P>In a hall of irregular shape sat Pete and Maggie drinking

<P>beer.&nbsp; A submissive orchestra dictated to by a spectacled man with

<P>frowsy hair and a dress suit, industriously followed the bobs of

<P>his head and the waves of his baton.&nbsp; A ballad singer, in a dress

<P>of flaming scarlet, sang in the inevitable voice of brass.&nbsp; When

<P>she vanished, men seated at the tables near the front applauded

<P>loudly, pounding the polished wood with their beer glasses.&nbsp; She

<P>returned attired in less gown, and sang again.&nbsp; She received

<P>another enthusiastic encore.&nbsp; She reappeared in still less gown
and

<P>danced.&nbsp; The deafening rumble of glasses and clapping of hands
that

<P>followed her exit indicated an overwhelming desire to have her come

<P>on for the fourth time, but the curiosity of the audience was not

<P>gratified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie was pale.&nbsp; From her eyes had been plucked all look of

<P>self-reliance.&nbsp; She leaned with a dependent air toward her

<P>companion.&nbsp; She was timid, as if fearing his anger or displeasure.

<P>She seemed to beseech tenderness of him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete's air of distinguished valor had grown upon him until it

<P>threatened stupendous dimensions.&nbsp; He was infinitely gracious to

<P>the girl.&nbsp; It was apparent to her that his condescension was a
marvel.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He could appear to strut even while sitting still and he showed that

<P>he was a lion of lordly characteristics by the air with which he spat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With Maggie gazing at him wonderingly, he took pride in commanding

<P>the waiters who were, however, indifferent or deaf.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hi, you, git a russle on yehs!&nbsp; What deh hell yehs lookin' at?

<P>Two more beehs, d'yeh hear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He leaned back and critically regarded the person of a girl

<P>with a straw-colored wig who upon the stage was flinging her heels

<P>in somewhat awkward imitation of a well-known danseuse.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At times Maggie told Pete long confidential tales of her

<P>former home life, dwelling upon the escapades of the other members

<P>of the family and the difficulties she had to combat in order to

<P>obtain a degree of comfort.&nbsp; He responded in tones of philanthropy.

<P>He pressed her arm with an air of reassuring proprietorship.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dey was damn jays," he said, denouncing the mother and brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The sound of the music which, by the efforts of the frowsy-

<P>headed leader, drifted to her ears through the smoke-filled

<P>atmosphere, made the girl dream.&nbsp; She thought of her former

<P>Rum Alley environment and turned to regard Pete's strong protecting

<P>fists.&nbsp; She thought of the collar and cuff manufactory and the

<P>eternal moan of the proprietor: "What een hell do you sink I pie

<P>fife dolla a week for?&nbsp; Play?&nbsp; No, py damn."&nbsp; She contemplated

<P>Pete's man-subduing eyes and noted that wealth and prosperity was

<P>indicated by his clothes.&nbsp; She imagined a future, rose-tinted,

<P>because of its distance from all that she previously had experienced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to the present she perceived only vague reasons to be

<P>miserable.&nbsp; Her life was Pete's and she considered him worthy of

<P>the charge.&nbsp; She would be disturbed by no particular apprehensions,

<P>so long as Pete adored her as he now said he did.&nbsp; She did not
feel

<P>like a bad woman.&nbsp; To her knowledge she had never seen any better.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At times men at other tables regarded the girl furtively.

<P>Pete, aware of it, nodded at her and grinned.&nbsp; He felt proud.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mag, yer a bloomin' good-looker," he remarked, studying her

<P>face through the haze.&nbsp; The men made Maggie fear, but she blushed

<P>at Pete's words as it became apparent to her that she was the apple

<P>of his eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Grey-headed men, wonderfully pathetic in their dissipation,

<P>stared at her through clouds.&nbsp; Smooth-cheeked boys, some of them

<P>with faces of stone and mouths of sin, not nearly so pathetic as

<P>the grey heads, tried to find the girl's eyes in the smoke wreaths.

<P>Maggie considered she was not what they thought her.&nbsp; She confined

<P>her glances to Pete and the stage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The orchestra played negro melodies and a versatile drummer

<P>pounded, whacked, clattered and scratched on a dozen machines to

<P>make noise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Those glances of the men, shot at Maggie from under half-closed lids,

<P>made her tremble.&nbsp; She thought them all to be worse men than Pete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come, let's go," she said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As they went out Maggie perceived two women seated at a table

<P>with some men.&nbsp; They were painted and their cheeks had lost their

<P>roundness.&nbsp; As she passed them the girl, with a shrinking movement,

<P>drew back her skirts.
