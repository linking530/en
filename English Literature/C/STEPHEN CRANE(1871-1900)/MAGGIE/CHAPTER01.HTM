<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very little boy stood upon a heap of gravel for the honor of

<P>Rum Alley.&nbsp; He was throwing stones at howling urchins from Devil's

<P>Row who were circling madly about the heap and pelting at him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His infantile countenance was livid with fury.&nbsp; His small body

<P>was writhing in the delivery of great, crimson oaths.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Run, Jimmie, run!&nbsp; Dey'll get yehs," screamed a retreating

<P>Rum Alley child.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Naw," responded Jimmie with a valiant roar, "dese micks can't

<P>make me run."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Howls of renewed wrath went up from Devil's Row throats.

<P>Tattered gamins on the right made a furious assault on the gravel

<P>heap.&nbsp; On their small, convulsed faces there shone the grins of

<P>true assassins.&nbsp; As they charged, they threw stones and cursed
in

<P>shrill chorus.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little champion of Rum Alley stumbled precipitately down

<P>the other side.&nbsp; His coat had been torn to shreds in a scuffle,
and

<P>his hat was gone.&nbsp; He had bruises on twenty parts of his body,
and

<P>blood was dripping from a cut in his head.&nbsp; His wan features wore

<P>a look of a tiny, insane demon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the ground, children from Devil's Row closed in on their

<P>antagonist.&nbsp; He crooked his left arm defensively about his head
and

<P>fought with cursing fury.&nbsp; The little boys ran to and fro, dodging,

<P>hurling stones and swearing in barbaric trebles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From a window of an apartment house that upreared its form

<P>from amid squat, ignorant stables, there leaned a curious woman.

<P>Some laborers, unloading a scow at a dock at the river, paused for

<P>a moment and regarded the fight.&nbsp; The engineer of a passive tugboat

<P>hung lazily to a railing and watched.&nbsp; Over on the Island, a worm

<P>building and crawled slowly along the river's bank.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A stone had smashed into Jimmie's mouth.&nbsp; Blood was bubbling

<P>over his chin and down upon his ragged shirt.&nbsp; Tears made furrows

<P>on his dirt-stained cheeks.&nbsp; His thin legs had begun to tremble
and

<P>turn weak, causing his small body to reel.&nbsp; His roaring curses
of

<P>the first part of the fight had changed to a blasphemous chatter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the yells of the whirling mob of Devil's Row children

<P>there were notes of joy like songs of triumphant savagery.

<P>The little boys seemed to leer gloatingly at the blood upon

<P>the other child's face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Down the avenue came boastfully sauntering a lad of sixteen

<P>years, although the chronic sneer of an ideal manhood already sat

<P>upon his lips.&nbsp; His hat was tipped with an air of challenge over

<P>his eye.&nbsp; Between his teeth, a cigar stump was tilted at the angle

<P>of defiance.&nbsp; He walked with a certain swing of the shoulders which

<P>appalled the timid.&nbsp; He glanced over into the vacant lot in which

<P>the little raving boys from Devil's Row seethed about the shrieking

<P>and tearful child from Rum Alley.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Gee!" he murmured with interest.&nbsp; "A scrap.&nbsp; Gee!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He strode over to the cursing circle, swinging his shoulders

<P>in a manner which denoted that he held victory in his fists.

<P>He approached at the back of one of the most deeply engaged

<P>of the Devil's Row children.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what deh hell," he said, and smote the deeply-engaged one

<P>on the back of the head.&nbsp; The little boy fell to the ground and

<P>gave a hoarse, tremendous howl.&nbsp; He scrambled to his feet, and

<P>perceiving, evidently, the size of his assailant, ran quickly off,

<P>shouting alarms.&nbsp; The entire Devil's Row party followed him.&nbsp;
They

<P>came to a stand a short distance away and yelled taunting oaths at

<P>the boy with the chronic sneer.&nbsp; The latter, momentarily, paid
no

<P>attention to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell, Jimmie?" he asked of the small champion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie wiped his blood-wet features with his sleeve.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, it was dis way, Pete, see!&nbsp; I was goin' teh lick dat

<P>Riley kid and dey all pitched on me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Some Rum Alley children now came forward.&nbsp; The party stood for

<P>a moment exchanging vainglorious remarks with Devil's Row.&nbsp; A few

<P>stones were thrown at long distances, and words of challenge passed

<P>between small warriors.&nbsp; Then the Rum Alley contingent turned

<P>slowly in the direction of their home street.&nbsp; They began to give,

<P>each to each, distorted versions of the fight.&nbsp; Causes of retreat

<P>in particular cases were magnified.&nbsp; Blows dealt in the fight were

<P>enlarged to catapultian power, and stones thrown were alleged to

<P>have hurtled with infinite accuracy.&nbsp; Valor grew strong again,

<P>and the little boys began to swear with great spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, we blokies kin lick deh hull damn Row," said a child, swaggering.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Little Jimmie was striving to stanch the flow of blood from

<P>his cut lips.&nbsp; Scowling, he turned upon the speaker.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, where deh hell was yeh when I was doin' all deh fightin?"

<P>he demanded.&nbsp; "Youse kids makes me tired."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, go ahn," replied the other argumentatively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie replied with heavy contempt.&nbsp; "Ah, youse can't fight,

<P>Blue Billie!&nbsp; I kin lick yeh wid one han'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, go ahn," replied Billie again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah," said Jimmie threateningly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah," said the other in the same tone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They struck at each other, clinched, and rolled over on the

<P>cobble stones.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Smash 'im, Jimmie, kick deh damn guts out of 'im," yelled Pete,

<P>the lad with the chronic sneer, in tones of delight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The small combatants pounded and kicked, scratched and tore.

<P>They began to weep and their curses struggled in their throats with

<P>sobs.&nbsp; The other little boys clasped their hands and wriggled their

<P>legs in excitement.&nbsp; They formed a bobbing circle about the pair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A tiny spectator was suddenly agitated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cheese it, Jimmie, cheese it!&nbsp; Here comes yer fader," he yelled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The circle of little boys instantly parted.&nbsp; They drew away

<P>and waited in ecstatic awe for that which was about to happen.

<P>The two little boys fighting in the modes of four thousand years ago,

<P>did not hear the warning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Up the avenue there plodded slowly a man with sullen eyes.

<P>He was carrying a dinner pail and smoking an apple-wood pipe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he neared the spot where the little boys strove, he

<P>regarded them listlessly.&nbsp; But suddenly he roared an oath and

<P>advanced upon the rolling fighters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Here, you Jim, git up, now, while I belt yer life out,

<P>you damned disorderly brat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He began to kick into the chaotic mass on the ground.&nbsp; The boy

<P>Billie felt a heavy boot strike his head.&nbsp; He made a furious effort

<P>and disentangled himself from Jimmie.&nbsp; He tottered away, damning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie arose painfully from the ground and confronting his

<P>father, began to curse him.&nbsp; His parent kicked him.&nbsp; "Come
home,

<P>now," he cried, "an' stop yer jawin', er I'll lam the everlasting

<P>head off yehs."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They departed.&nbsp; The man paced placidly along with the apple-

<P>wood emblem of serenity between his teeth.&nbsp; The boy followed a

<P>dozen feet in the rear.&nbsp; He swore luridly, for he felt that it
was

<P>degradation for one who aimed to be some vague soldier, or a man of

<P>blood with a sort of sublime license, to be taken home by a father.
