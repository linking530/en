<P>Pete took note of Maggie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, Mag, I'm stuck on yer shape.&nbsp; It's outa sight," he said,

<P>parenthetically, with an affable grin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he became aware that she was listening closely, he grew

<P>still more eloquent in his descriptions of various happenings in

<P>his career.&nbsp; It appeared that he was invincible in fights.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why," he said, referring to a man with whom he had had a

<P>misunderstanding, "dat mug scrapped like a damn dago.&nbsp; Dat's right.

<P>He was dead easy.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; He tau't he was a scrapper.&nbsp;
But he foun'

<P>out diff'ent!&nbsp; Hully gee."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He walked to and fro in the small room, which seemed then to

<P>grow even smaller and unfit to hold his dignity, the attribute of

<P>a supreme warrior.&nbsp; That swing of the shoulders that had frozen
the

<P>timid when he was but a lad had increased with his growth and

<P>education at the ratio of ten to one.&nbsp; It, combined with the sneer

<P>upon his mouth, told mankind that there was nothing in space which

<P>could appall him.&nbsp; Maggie marvelled at him and surrounded him with

<P>greatness.&nbsp; She vaguely tried to calculate the altitude of the

<P>pinnacle from which he must have looked down upon her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I met a chump deh odder day way up in deh city," he said.&nbsp; "I

<P>was goin' teh see a frien' of mine.&nbsp; When I was a-crossin' deh

<P>street deh chump runned plump inteh me, an' den he turns aroun' an'

<P>says, 'Yer insolen' ruffin,' he says, like dat.&nbsp; 'Oh, gee,' I says,

<P>'oh, gee, go teh hell and git off deh eart',' I says, like dat.

<P>See?&nbsp; 'Go teh hell an' git off deh eart',' like dat.&nbsp; Den
deh

<P>blokie he got wild.&nbsp; He says I was a contempt'ble scoun'el,

<P>er somet'ing like dat, an' he says I was doom' teh everlastin'

<P>pe'dition an' all like dat.&nbsp; 'Gee,' I says, 'gee!&nbsp; Deh hell
I am,'

<P>I says.&nbsp; 'Deh hell I am,' like dat.&nbsp; An' den I slugged 'im.&nbsp;
See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With Jimmie in his company, Pete departed in a sort of a blaze

<P>of glory from the Johnson home.&nbsp; Maggie, leaning from the window,

<P>watched him as he walked down the street.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was a formidable man who disdained the strength of a

<P>world full of fists.&nbsp; Here was one who had contempt for brass-

<P>clothed power; one whose knuckles could defiantly ring against the

<P>granite of law.&nbsp; He was a knight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two men went from under the glimmering street-lamp and

<P>passed into shadows.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Turning, Maggie contemplated the dark, dust-stained walls, and

<P>the scant and crude furniture of her home.&nbsp; A clock, in a

<P>splintered and battered oblong box of varnished wood, she suddenly

<P>regarded as an abomination.&nbsp; She noted that it ticked raspingly.

<P>The almost vanished flowers in the carpet-pattern, she conceived to

<P>be newly hideous.&nbsp; Some faint attempts she had made with blue

<P>ribbon, to freshen the appearance of a dingy curtain, she now saw

<P>to be piteous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wondered what Pete dined on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She reflected upon the collar and cuff factory.&nbsp; It began to

<P>appear to her mind as a dreary place of endless grinding.&nbsp; Pete's

<P>elegant occupation brought him, no doubt, into contact with people

<P>who had money and manners.&nbsp; it was probable that he had a large

<P>acquaintance of pretty girls.&nbsp; He must have great sums of money
to

<P>spend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To her the earth was composed of hardships and insults.&nbsp; She

<P>felt instant admiration for a man who openly defied it.&nbsp; She

<P>thought that if the grim angel of death should clutch his heart,

<P>Pete would shrug his shoulders and say: "Oh, ev'ryt'ing goes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She anticipated that he would come again shortly.&nbsp; She spent

<P>some of her week's pay in the purchase of flowered cretonne for a

<P>lambrequin.&nbsp; She made it with infinite care and hung it to the

<P>slightly-careening mantel, over the stove, in the kitchen.&nbsp; She

<P>studied it with painful anxiety from different points in the room.

<P>She wanted it to look well on Sunday night when, perhaps, Jimmie's

<P>friend would come.&nbsp; On Sunday night, however, Pete did not appear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Afterward the girl looked at it with a sense of humiliation.

<P>She was now convinced that Pete was superior to admiration for

<P>lambrequins.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few evenings later Pete entered with fascinating innovations

<P>in his apparel.&nbsp; As she had seen him twice and he had different

<P>suits on each time, Maggie had a dim impression that his

<P>wardrobe was prodigiously extensive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, Mag," he said, "put on yer bes' duds Friday night an'

<P>I'll take yehs teh deh show.&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He spent a few moments in flourishing his clothes and then

<P>vanished, without having glanced at the lambrequin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Over the eternal collars and cuffs in the factory Maggie spent

<P>the most of three days in making imaginary sketches of Pete and his

<P>daily environment.&nbsp; She imagined some half dozen women in love
with

<P>him and thought he must lean dangerously toward an indefinite one,

<P>whom she pictured with great charms of person, but with an

<P>altogether contemptible disposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She thought he must live in a blare of pleasure.&nbsp; He had friends,

<P>and people who were afraid of him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She saw the golden glitter of the place where Pete was to take

<P>her.&nbsp; An entertainment of many hues and many melodies where she
was

<P>afraid she might appear small and mouse-colored.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her mother drank whiskey all Friday morning.&nbsp; With lurid face

<P>and tossing hair she cursed and destroyed furniture all Friday

<P>afternoon.&nbsp; When Maggie came home at half-past six her mother lay

<P>asleep amidst the wreck of chairs and a table.&nbsp; Fragments of

<P>various household utensils were scattered about the floor.

<P>She had vented some phase of drunken fury upon the lambrequin.

<P>It lay in a bedraggled heap in the corner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hah," she snorted, sitting up suddenly, "where deh hell yeh

<P>been?&nbsp; Why deh hell don' yeh come home earlier?&nbsp; Been loafin'

<P>'round deh streets.&nbsp; Yer gettin' teh be a reg'lar devil."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Pete arrived Maggie, in a worn black dress, was waiting

<P>for him in the midst of a floor strewn with wreckage.&nbsp; The curtain

<P>at the window had been pulled by a heavy hand and hung by one tack,

<P>dangling to and fro in the draft through the cracks at the sash.

<P>The knots of blue ribbons appeared like violated flowers.&nbsp; The
fire

<P>in the stove had gone out.&nbsp; The displaced lids and open doors

<P>showed heaps of sullen grey ashes.&nbsp; The remnants of a meal,

<P>ghastly, like dead flesh, lay in a corner.&nbsp; Maggie's red mother,

<P>stretched on the floor, blasphemed and gave her daughter a bad name.
