<P>Pete did not consider that he had ruined Maggie.&nbsp; If he had

<P>thought that her soul could never smile again, he would have

<P>believed the mother and brother, who were pyrotechnic over the

<P>affair, to be responsible for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Besides, in his world, souls did not insist upon being able to smile.

<P>"What deh hell?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He felt a trifle entangled.&nbsp; It distressed him.&nbsp; Revelations

<P>and scenes might bring upon him the wrath of the owner of the

<P>saloon, who insisted upon respectability of an advanced type.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell do dey wanna raise such a smoke about it fer?"

<P>demanded he of himself, disgusted with the attitude of the family.

<P>He saw no necessity for anyone's losing their equilibrium merely

<P>because their sister or their daughter had stayed away from home.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Searching about in his mind for possible reasons for their conduct,

<P>he came upon the conclusion that Maggie's motives were correct,

<P>but that the two others wished to snare him.&nbsp; He felt pursued.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman of brilliance and audacity whom he had met in the

<P>hilarious hall showed a disposition to ridicule him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A little pale thing with no spirit," she said.&nbsp; "Did you note

<P>the expression of her eyes?&nbsp; There was something in them about

<P>pumpkin pie and virtue.&nbsp; That is a peculiar way the left corner

<P>of her mouth has of twitching, isn't it?&nbsp; Dear, dear, my cloud-

<P>compelling Pete, what are you coming to?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete asserted at once that he never was very much interested

<P>in the girl.&nbsp; The woman interrupted him, laughing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, it's not of the slightest consequence to me, my dear young man.

<P>You needn't draw maps for my benefit.&nbsp; Why should I be concerned
about it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Pete continued with his explanations.&nbsp; If he was laughed

<P>at for his tastes in women, he felt obliged to say that they were

<P>only temporary or indifferent ones.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The morning after Maggie had departed from home, Pete stood

<P>behind the bar.&nbsp; He was immaculate in white jacket and apron and

<P>his hair was plastered over his brow with infinite correctness.

<P>No customers were in the place.&nbsp; Pete was twisting his napkined

<P>fist slowly in a beer glass, softly whistling to himself and

<P>occasionally holding the object of his attention between his eyes

<P>and a few weak beams of sunlight that had found their way over

<P>the thick screens and into the shaded room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With lingering thoughts of the woman of brilliance and

<P>audacity, the bartender raised his head and stared through the

<P>varying cracks between the swaying bamboo doors.&nbsp; Suddenly

<P>the whistling pucker faded from his lips.&nbsp; He saw Maggie walking

<P>slowly past.&nbsp; He gave a great start, fearing for the previously-

<P>mentioned eminent respectability of the place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He threw a swift, nervous glance about him, all at once

<P>feeling guilty.&nbsp; No one was in the room.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went hastily over to the side door.&nbsp; Opening it and looking

<P>out, he perceived Maggie standing, as if undecided, on the corner.

<P>She was searching the place with her eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she turned her face toward him Pete beckoned to her

<P>hurriedly, intent upon returning with speed to a position behind

<P>the bar and to the atmosphere of respectability upon which the

<P>proprietor insisted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie came to him, the anxious look disappearing from her

<P>face and a smile wreathing her lips.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Pete--," she began brightly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The bartender made a violent gesture of impatience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, my Gawd," cried he, vehemently.&nbsp; "What deh hell do yeh

<P>wanna hang aroun' here fer?&nbsp; Do yeh wanna git me inteh trouble?"

<P>he demanded with an air of injury.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Astonishment swept over the girl's features.&nbsp; "Why, Pete! yehs
tol' me--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete glanced profound irritation.&nbsp; His countenance reddened

<P>with the anger of a man whose respectability is being threatened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, yehs makes me tired.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; What deh hell deh yeh wanna

<P>tag aroun' atter me fer?&nbsp; Yeh'll git me inteh trouble wid deh ol'

<P>man an' dey'll be hell teh pay!&nbsp; If he sees a woman roun' here

<P>he'll go crazy an' I'll lose me job!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Yer brudder come
in

<P>here an' raised hell an' deh ol' man hada put up fer it!&nbsp; An' now

<P>I'm done!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I'm done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl's eyes stared into his face.&nbsp; "Pete, don't yeh remem--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, hell," interrupted Pete, anticipating.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl seemed to have a struggle with herself.&nbsp; She was apparently

<P>bewildered and could not find speech.&nbsp; Finally she asked in a low
voice:

<P>"But where kin I go?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The question exasperated Pete beyond the powers of endurance.

<P>It was a direct attempt to give him some responsibility in a matter

<P>that did not concern him.&nbsp; In his indignation he volunteered information.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, go teh hell," cried he.&nbsp; He slammed the door furiously

<P>and returned, with an air of relief, to his respectability.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wandered aimlessly for several blocks.&nbsp; She stopped once

<P>and asked aloud a question of herself: "Who?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A man who was passing near her shoulder, humorously took the

<P>questioning word as intended for him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Nobody!&nbsp; I didn't say anything,"

<P>he laughingly said, and continued his way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Soon the girl discovered that if she walked with such

<P>apparent aimlessness, some men looked at her with calculating eyes.

<P>She quickened her step, frightened.&nbsp; As a protection, she adopted

<P>a demeanor of intentness as if going somewhere.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time she left rattling avenues and passed between rows

<P>of houses with sternness and stolidity stamped upon their features.

<P>She hung her head for she felt their eyes grimly upon her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly she came upon a stout gentleman in a silk hat and a

<P>chaste black coat, whose decorous row of buttons reached from his

<P>chin to his knees.&nbsp; The girl had heard of the Grace of God and
she

<P>decided to approach this man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His beaming, chubby face was a picture of benevolence and

<P>kind-heartedness.&nbsp; His eyes shone good-will.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But as the girl timidly accosted him, he gave a convulsive

<P>movement and saved his respectability by a vigorous side-step.

<P>He did not risk it to save a soul.&nbsp; For how was he to know that

<P>there was a soul before him that needed saving?
