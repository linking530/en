<P>Upon a wet evening, several months after the last chapter,

<P>two interminable rows of cars, pulled by slipping horses,

<P>jangled along a prominent side-street.&nbsp; A dozen cabs, with coat-enshrouded

<P>drivers, clattered to and fro.&nbsp; Electric lights, whirring softly,

<P>shed a blurred radiance.&nbsp; A flower dealer, his feet tapping

<P>impatiently, his nose and his wares glistening with rain-drops,

<P>stood behind an array of roses and chrysanthemums.&nbsp; Two or three

<P>theatres emptied a crowd upon the storm-swept pavements.&nbsp; Men

<P>pulled their hats over their eyebrows and raised their collars to

<P>their ears.&nbsp; Women shrugged impatient shoulders in their warm

<P>cloaks and stopped to arrange their skirts for a walk through the

<P>storm.&nbsp; People having been comparatively silent for two hours burst

<P>into a roar of conversation, their hearts still kindling from the

<P>glowings of the stage.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The pavements became tossing seas of umbrellas.&nbsp; Men stepped

<P>forth to hail cabs or cars, raising their fingers in varied forms

<P>of polite request or imperative demand.&nbsp; An endless procession

<P>wended toward elevated stations.&nbsp; An atmosphere of pleasure and

<P>prosperity seemed to hang over the throng, born, perhaps, of good

<P>clothes and of having just emerged from a place of forgetfulness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the mingled light and gloom of an adjacent park,

<P>a handful of wet wanderers, in attitudes of chronic dejection,

<P>was scattered among the benches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A girl of the painted cohorts of the city went along the street.

<P>She threw changing glances at men who passed her, giving smiling

<P>invitations to men of rural or untaught pattern and usually seeming

<P>sedately unconscious of the men with a metropolitan seal upon their
faces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crossing glittering avenues, she went into the throng emerging

<P>from the places of forgetfulness.&nbsp; She hurried forward through
the

<P>crowd as if intent upon reaching a distant home, bending forward in

<P>her handsome cloak, daintily lifting her skirts and picking for her

<P>well-shod feet the dryer spots upon the pavements.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The restless doors of saloons, clashing to and fro, disclosed

<P>animated rows of men before bars and hurrying barkeepers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A concert hall gave to the street faint sounds of swift,

<P>machine-like music, as if a group of phantom musicians were

<P>hastening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A tall young man, smoking a cigarette with a sublime air,

<P>strolled near the girl.&nbsp; He had on evening dress, a moustache,
a

<P>chrysanthemum, and a look of ennui, all of which he kept carefully

<P>under his eye.&nbsp; Seeing the girl walk on as if such a young man
as

<P>he was not in existence, he looked back transfixed with interest.

<P>He stared glassily for a moment, but gave a slight convulsive start

<P>when he discerned that she was neither new, Parisian, nor theatrical.

<P>He wheeled about hastily and turned his stare into the air,

<P>like a sailor with a search-light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A stout gentleman, with pompous and philanthropic whiskers,

<P>went stolidly by, the broad of his back sneering at the girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A belated man in business clothes, and in haste to catch a

<P>car, bounced against her shoulder.&nbsp; "Hi, there, Mary, I beg your

<P>pardon!&nbsp; Brace up, old girl."&nbsp; He grasped her arm to steady
her,

<P>and then was away running down the middle of the street.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl walked on out of the realm of restaurants and

<P>saloons.&nbsp; She passed more glittering avenues and went into darker

<P>blocks than those where the crowd travelled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A young man in light overcoat and derby hat received a glance

<P>shot keenly from the eyes of the girl.&nbsp; He stopped and looked at

<P>her, thrusting his hands in his pockets and making a mocking smile

<P>curl his lips.&nbsp; "Come, now, old lady," he said, "you don't mean
to

<P>tell me that you sized me up for a farmer?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A laboring man marched along with bundles under his arms.

<P>To her remarks, he replied: "It's a fine evenin', ain't it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She smiled squarely into the face of a boy who was hurrying by

<P>with his hands buried in his overcoat, his blonde locks bobbing on

<P>his youthful temples, and a cheery smile of unconcern upon his

<P>lips.&nbsp; He turned his head and smiled back at her, waving his hands.

<P>him.&nbsp; "He's all right!&nbsp; He didn't mean anything!&nbsp; Let
it go!

<P>He's a good fellah!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Din' he insul' me?" asked the man earnestly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said they.&nbsp; "Of course he didn't!&nbsp; He's all right!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure he didn' insul' me?" demanded the man, with deep anxiety

<P>in his voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no!&nbsp; We know him!&nbsp; He's a good fellah.&nbsp; He didn't
mean anything."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, zen," said the man, resolutely, "I'm go' 'pol'gize!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the waiter came, the man struggled to the middle of the floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Girlsh shed you insul' me!&nbsp; I shay damn lie!&nbsp; I 'pol'gize!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All right," said the waiter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man sat down.&nbsp; He felt a sleepy but strong desire to straighten

<P>things out and have a perfect understanding with everybody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nell, I allus trea's yeh shquare, din' I?&nbsp; Yeh likes me, don'
yehs, Nell?

<P>I'm goo' f'ler?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure," said the woman of brilliance and audacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh knows I'm stuck on yehs, don' yehs, Nell?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure," she repeated, carelessly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Overwhelmed by a spasm of drunken adoration, he drew two or

<P>three bills from his pocket, and, with the trembling fingers of an

<P>offering priest, laid them on the table before the woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yehs knows, damn it, yehs kin have all got, 'cause I'm stuck on yehs,

<P>Nell, damn't, I--I'm stuck on yehs, Nell--buy drinksh--damn't--we're
havin'

<P>heluva time--w'en anyone trea's me ri'--I--damn't, Nell--we're havin'

<P>heluva--time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shortly he went to sleep with his swollen face fallen forward on his
chest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The women drank and laughed, not heeding the slumbering man in the corner.

<P>Finally he lurched forward and fell groaning to the floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The women screamed in disgust and drew back their skirts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come ahn," cried one, starting up angrily, "let's get out of here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman of brilliance and audacity stayed behind, taking up

<P>the bills and stuffing them into a deep, irregularly-shaped pocket.

<P>A guttural snore from the recumbent man caused her to turn and look

<P>down at him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She laughed.&nbsp; "What a damn fool," she said, and went.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The smoke from the lamps settled heavily down in the little

<P>compartment, obscuring the way out.&nbsp; The smell of oil, stifling
in

<P>its intensity, pervaded the air.&nbsp; The wine from an overturned glass

<P>dripped softly down upon the blotches on the man's neck.
