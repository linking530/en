<P>Eventually they entered into a dark region where, from a

<P>careening building, a dozen gruesome doorways gave up loads of

<P>babies to the street and the gutter.&nbsp; A wind of early autumn raised

<P>yellow dust from cobbles and swirled it against an hundred windows.

<P>Long streamers of garments fluttered from fire-escapes.&nbsp; In all

<P>unhandy places there were buckets, brooms, rags and bottles.&nbsp; In

<P>the street infants played or fought with other infants or sat

<P>stupidly in the way of vehicles.&nbsp; Formidable women, with uncombed

<P>hair and disordered dress, gossiped while leaning on railings, or

<P>screamed in frantic quarrels.&nbsp; Withered persons, in curious

<P>postures of submission to something, sat smoking pipes in obscure

<P>corners.&nbsp; A thousand odors of cooking food came forth to the

<P>street.&nbsp; The building quivered and creaked from the weight of

<P>humanity stamping about in its bowels.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A small ragged girl dragged a red, bawling infant along the

<P>crowded ways.&nbsp; He was hanging back, baby-like, bracing his

<P>wrinkled, bare legs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little girl cried out: "Ah, Tommie, come ahn.

<P>Dere's Jimmie and fader.&nbsp; Don't be a-pullin' me back."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She jerked the baby's arm impatiently.&nbsp; He fell on his face,

<P>roaring.&nbsp; With a second jerk she pulled him to his feet, and they

<P>went on.&nbsp; With the obstinacy of his order, he protested against

<P>being dragged in a chosen direction.&nbsp; He made heroic endeavors
to

<P>keep on his legs, denounce his sister and consume a bit of orange

<P>peeling which he chewed between the times of his infantile

<P>orations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the sullen-eyed man, followed by the blood-covered boy,

<P>drew near, the little girl burst into reproachful cries.

<P>"Ah, Jimmie, youse bin fightin' agin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The urchin swelled disdainfully.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what deh hell, Mag.&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little girl upbraided him,&nbsp; "Youse allus fightin', Jimmie,

<P>an' yeh knows it puts mudder out when yehs come home half dead,

<P>an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She began to weep.&nbsp; The babe threw back his head and roared at

<P>his prospects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what deh hell!" cried Jimmie.&nbsp; Shut up er I'll smack yer mout'.&nbsp;
See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As his sister continued her lamentations, he suddenly swore

<P>and struck her.&nbsp; The little girl reeled and, recovering herself,

<P>burst into tears and quaveringly cursed him.&nbsp; As she slowly

<P>retreated her brother advanced dealing her cuffs.&nbsp; The father heard

<P>and turned about.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop that, Jim, d'yeh hear?&nbsp; Leave yer sister alone on the

<P>street.&nbsp; It's like I can never beat any sense into yer damned

<P>wooden head."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The urchin raised his voice in defiance to his parent and

<P>continued his attacks.&nbsp; The babe bawled tremendously, protesting

<P>with great violence.&nbsp; During his sister's hasty manoeuvres, he
was

<P>dragged by the arm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Finally the procession plunged into one of the gruesome doorways.

<P>They crawled up dark stairways and along cold, gloomy halls.

<P>At last the father pushed open a door and they entered a lighted room

<P>in which a large woman was rampant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stopped in a career from a seething stove to a pan-covered table.

<P>As the father and children filed in she peered at them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh, what?&nbsp; Been fightin' agin, by Gawd!"&nbsp; She threw herself

<P>upon Jimmie.&nbsp; The urchin tried to dart behind the others and in
the

<P>scuffle the babe, Tommie, was knocked down.&nbsp; He protested with
his

<P>usual vehemence, because they had bruised his tender shins against

<P>a table leg.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother's massive shoulders heaved with anger.&nbsp; Grasping the

<P>urchin by the neck and shoulder she shook him until he rattled.

<P>She dragged him to an unholy sink, and, soaking a rag in water,

<P>began to scrub his lacerated face with it.&nbsp; Jimmie screamed in
pain

<P>and tried to twist his shoulders out of the clasp of the huge arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The babe sat on the floor watching the scene, his face in contortions

<P>like that of a woman at a tragedy.&nbsp; The father, with a newly-ladened

<P>pipe in his mouth, crouched on a backless chair near the stove.

<P>Jimmie's cries annoyed him.&nbsp; He turned about and bellowed at his
wife:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let the damned kid alone for a minute, will yeh, Mary?&nbsp; Yer allus

<P>poundin' 'im.&nbsp; When I come nights I can't git no rest 'cause

<P>yer allus poundin' a kid.&nbsp; Let up, d'yeh hear?&nbsp; Don't be allus

<P>poundin' a kid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman's operations on the urchin instantly increased in violence.

<P>At last she tossed him to a corner where he limply lay cursing and weeping.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wife put her immense hands on her hips and with a

<P>chieftain-like stride approached her husband.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ho," she said, with a great grunt of contempt.&nbsp; "An' what in

<P>the devil are you stickin' your nose for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The babe crawled under the table and, turning, peered out

<P>cautiously.&nbsp; The ragged girl retreated and the urchin in the corner

<P>drew his legs carefully beneath him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man puffed his pipe calmly and put his great mudded boots

<P>on the back part of the stove.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go teh hell," he murmured, tranquilly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman screamed and shook her fists before her husband's

<P>eyes.&nbsp; The rough yellow of her face and neck flared suddenly

<P>crimson.&nbsp; She began to howl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He puffed imperturbably at his pipe for a time, but finally

<P>arose and began to look out at the window into the darkening chaos

<P>of back yards.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You've been drinkin', Mary," he said.&nbsp; "You'd better let up

<P>on the bot', ol' woman, or you'll git done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You're a liar.&nbsp; I ain't had a drop," she roared in reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They had a lurid altercation, in which they damned each

<P>other's souls with frequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The babe was staring out from under the table, his small face

<P>working in his excitement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ragged girl went stealthily over to the corner where the

<P>urchin lay.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are yehs hurted much, Jimmie?" she whispered timidly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not a damn bit!&nbsp; See?" growled the little boy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will I wash deh blood?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Naw!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Will I--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When I catch dat Riley kid I'll break 'is face!&nbsp; Dat's right!&nbsp;
See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned his face to the wall as if resolved to grimly bide

<P>his time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the quarrel between husband and wife, the woman was victor.

<P>The man grabbed his hat and rushed from the room, apparently

<P>determined upon a vengeful drunk.&nbsp; She followed to the door and

<P>thundered at him as he made his way down stairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She returned and stirred up the room until her children were

<P>bobbing about like bubbles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Git outa deh way," she persistently bawled, waving feet

<P>with their dishevelled shoes near the heads of her children.

<P>She shrouded herself, puffing and snorting, in a cloud of steam

<P>at the stove, and eventually extracted a frying-pan full of potatoes

<P>that hissed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She flourished it.&nbsp; "Come teh yer suppers, now," she cried

<P>with sudden exasperation.&nbsp; "Hurry up, now, er I'll help yeh!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The children scrambled hastily.&nbsp; With prodigious clatter they

<P>arranged themselves at table.&nbsp; The babe sat with his feet dangling

<P>high from a precarious infant chair and gorged his small stomach.

<P>Jimmie forced, with feverish rapidity, the grease-enveloped pieces

<P>between his wounded lips.&nbsp; Maggie, with side glances of fear of

<P>interruption, ate like a small pursued tigress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother sat blinking at them.&nbsp; She delivered reproaches,

<P>swallowed potatoes and drank from a yellow-brown bottle.

<P>After a time her mood changed and she wept as she carried

<P>little Tommie into another room and laid him to sleep

<P>with his fists doubled in an old quilt of faded red

<P>and green grandeur.&nbsp; Then she came and moaned by the stove.

<P>She rocked to and fro upon a chair, shedding tears

<P>and crooning miserably to the two children about their

<P>"poor mother" and "yer fader, damn 'is soul."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The little girl plodded between the table and the chair with

<P>a dish-pan on it.&nbsp; She tottered on her small legs beneath burdens

<P>of dishes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie sat nursing his various wounds.&nbsp; He cast furtive glances

<P>at his mother.&nbsp; His practised eye perceived her gradually emerge

<P>from a muddled mist of sentiment until her brain burned in

<P>drunken heat.&nbsp; He sat breathless.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie broke a plate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother started to her feet as if propelled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Good Gawd," she howled.&nbsp; Her eyes glittered on her child with

<P>sudden hatred.&nbsp; The fervent red of her face turned almost to

<P>purple.&nbsp; The little boy ran to the halls, shrieking like a monk
in

<P>an earthquake.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He floundered about in darkness until he found the stairs.&nbsp; He
stumbled,

<P>panic-stricken, to the next floor.&nbsp; An old woman opened a door.

<P>A light behind her threw a flare on the urchin's quivering face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh, Gawd, child, what is it dis time?&nbsp; Is yer fader beatin'

<P>yer mudder, or yer mudder beatin' yer fader?"
