<P>In a hilarious hall there were twenty-eight tables and twenty-

<P>eight women and a crowd of smoking men.&nbsp; Valiant noise was made
on

<P>a stage at the end of the hall by an orchestra composed of men who

<P>looked as if they had just happened in.&nbsp; Soiled waiters ran to
and

<P>fro, swooping down like hawks on the unwary in the throng;

<P>clattering along the aisles with trays covered with glasses;

<P>stumbling over women's skirts and charging two prices for

<P>everything but beer, all with a swiftness that blurred the view of

<P>the cocoanut palms and dusty monstrosities painted upon the walls

<P>of the room.&nbsp; A bouncer, with an immense load of business upon
his

<P>hands, plunged about in the crowd, dragging bashful strangers to

<P>prominent chairs, ordering waiters here and there and quarreling

<P>furiously with men who wanted to sing with the orchestra.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The usual smoke cloud was present, but so dense that heads and

<P>arms seemed entangled in it.&nbsp; The rumble of conversation was

<P>replaced by a roar.&nbsp; Plenteous oaths heaved through the air.

<P>The room rang with the shrill voices of women bubbling o'er with

<P>drink-laughter.&nbsp; The chief element in the music of the orchestra

<P>was speed.&nbsp; The musicians played in intent fury.&nbsp; A woman
was

<P>singing and smiling upon the stage, but no one took notice of her.

<P>The rate at which the piano, cornet and violins were going, seemed

<P>to impart wildness to the half-drunken crowd.&nbsp; Beer glasses were

<P>emptied at a gulp and conversation became a rapid chatter.

<P>The smoke eddied and swirled like a shadowy river hurrying toward

<P>some unseen falls.&nbsp; Pete and Maggie entered the hall and took chairs

<P>at a table near the door.&nbsp; The woman who was seated there made

<P>an attempt to occupy Pete's attention and, failing, went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Three weeks had passed since the girl had left home.&nbsp; The air of

<P>spaniel-like dependence had been magnified and showed its direct

<P>effect in the peculiar off-handedness and ease of Pete's ways toward
her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She followed Pete's eyes with hers, anticipating with smiles

<P>gracious looks from him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A woman of brilliance and audacity, accompanied by a mere boy,

<P>came into the place and took seats near them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At once Pete sprang to his feet, his face beaming with glad surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By Gawd, there's Nellie," he cried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went over to the table and held out an eager hand to the woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, hello, Pete, me boy, how are you," said she, giving him her fingers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie took instant note of the woman.&nbsp; She perceived that her

<P>black dress fitted her to perfection.&nbsp; Her linen collar and cuffs

<P>were spotless.&nbsp; Tan gloves were stretched over her well-shaped

<P>hands.&nbsp; A hat of a prevailing fashion perched jauntily upon her

<P>dark hair.&nbsp; She wore no jewelry and was painted with no apparent

<P>paint.&nbsp; She looked clear-eyed through the stares of the men.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sit down, and call your lady-friend over," she said cordially to Pete.

<P>At his beckoning Maggie came and sat between Pete and the mere boy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought yeh were gone away fer good," began Pete, at once.

<P>"When did yeh git back?&nbsp; How did dat Buff'lo bus'ness turn out?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; "Well, he didn't have as

<P>many stamps as he tried to make out, so I shook him, that's all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I'm glad teh see yehs back in deh city," said Pete,

<P>with awkward gallantry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He and the woman entered into a long conversation, exchanging

<P>reminiscences of days together.&nbsp; Maggie sat still, unable to

<P>formulate an intelligent sentence upon the conversation and

<P>painfully aware of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She saw Pete's eyes sparkle as he gazed upon the handsome

<P>stranger.&nbsp; He listened smilingly to all she said.&nbsp; The woman
was

<P>familiar with all his affairs, asked him about mutual friends,

<P>and knew the amount of his salary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She paid no attention to Maggie, looking toward her once or

<P>twice and apparently seeing the wall beyond.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mere boy was sulky.&nbsp; In the beginning he had welcomed with

<P>acclamations the additions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Let's all have a drink!&nbsp; What'll you take, Nell?&nbsp; And you,

<P>Miss what's-your-name.&nbsp; Have a drink, Mr. -----, you, I mean."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had shown a sprightly desire to do the talking for the company

<P>and tell all about his family.&nbsp; In a loud voice he declaimed

<P>on various topics.&nbsp; He assumed a patronizing air toward Pete.

<P>As Maggie was silent, he paid no attention to her.&nbsp; He made a

<P>great show of lavishing wealth upon the woman of brilliance

<P>and audacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do keep still, Freddie!&nbsp; You gibber like an ape, dear," said the

<P>woman to him.&nbsp; She turned away and devoted her attention to Pete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We'll have many a good time together again, eh?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure, Mike," said Pete, enthusiastic at once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say," whispered she, leaning forward, "let's go over to

<P>Billie's and have a heluva time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, it's dis way!&nbsp; See?" said Pete.&nbsp; I got dis lady frien'
here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, t'hell with her," argued the woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete appeared disturbed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"All right," said she, nodding her head at him.&nbsp; "All right for
you!

<P>We'll see the next time you ask me to go anywheres with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete squirmed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say," he said, beseechingly, "come wid me a minit an' I'll tell yer
why."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman waved her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, that's all right, you needn't explain, you know.&nbsp; You wouldn't

<P>come merely because you wouldn't come, that's all there is of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Pete's visible distress she turned to the mere boy,

<P>bringing him speedily from a terrific rage.&nbsp; He had been debating

<P>whether it would be the part of a man to pick a quarrel with Pete,

<P>or would he be justified in striking him savagely with his beer

<P>glass without warning.&nbsp; But he recovered himself when the woman

<P>turned to renew her smilings.&nbsp; He beamed upon her with an

<P>expression that was somewhat tipsy and inexpressibly tender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, shake that Bowery jay," requested he, in a loud whisper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Freddie, you are so droll," she replied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete reached forward and touched the woman on the arm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Come out a minit while I tells yeh why I can't go wid yer.

<P>Yer doin' me dirt, Nell!&nbsp; I never taut ye'd do me dirt, Nell.

<P>Come on, will yer?"&nbsp; He spoke in tones of injury.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, I don't see why I should be interested in your

<P>explanations," said the woman, with a coldness that seemed to

<P>reduce Pete to a pulp.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His eyes pleaded with her.&nbsp; "Come out a minit while I tells yeh."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman nodded slightly at Maggie and the mere boy, "'Scuse me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mere boy interrupted his loving smile and turned a shrivelling

<P>glare upon Pete.&nbsp; His boyish countenance flushed and he spoke,

<P>in a whine, to the woman:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, I say, Nellie, this ain't a square deal, you know.&nbsp; You aren't

<P>goin' to leave me and go off with that duffer, are you?&nbsp; I should
think--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you dear boy, of course I'm not," cried the woman,

<P>affectionately.&nbsp; She bended over and whispered in his ear.

<P>He smiled again and settled in his chair as if resolved

<P>to wait patiently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the woman walked down between the rows of tables, Pete was

<P>at her shoulder talking earnestly, apparently in explanation.

<P>The woman waved her hands with studied airs of indifference.

<P>The doors swung behind them, leaving Maggie and the mere boy

<P>seated at the table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie was dazed.&nbsp; She could dimly perceive that something

<P>stupendous had happened.&nbsp; She wondered why Pete saw fit to

<P>remonstrate with the woman, pleading for forgiveness with his eyes.

<P>She thought she noted an air of submission about her leonine Pete.

<P>She was astounded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mere boy occupied himself with cock-tails and a cigar.&nbsp; He

<P>was tranquilly silent for half an hour.&nbsp; Then he bestirred himself

<P>and spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," he said, sighing, "I knew this was the way it would be."

<P>There was another stillness.&nbsp; The mere boy seemed to be musing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She was pulling m'leg.&nbsp; That's the whole amount of it," he

<P>said, suddenly.&nbsp; "It's a bloomin' shame the way that girl does.

<P>Why, I've spent over two dollars in drinks to-night.&nbsp; And she goes

<P>off with that plug-ugly who looks as if he had been hit in the face

<P>with a coin-die.&nbsp; I call it rocky treatment for a fellah like me.

<P>Here, waiter, bring me a cock-tail and make it damned strong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie made no reply.&nbsp; She was watching the doors.&nbsp; "It's
a

<P>mean piece of business," complained the mere boy.&nbsp; He explained
to

<P>her how amazing it was that anybody should treat him in such a

<P>manner.&nbsp; "But I'll get square with her, you bet.&nbsp; She won't
get far

<P>ahead of yours truly, you know," he added, winking.&nbsp; "I'll tell
her

<P>plainly that it was bloomin' mean business.&nbsp; And she won't come
it

<P>over me with any of her 'now-Freddie-dears.'&nbsp; She thinks my name
is

<P>Freddie, you know, but of course it ain't.&nbsp; I always tell these

<P>people some name like that, because if they got onto your right name

<P>they might use it sometime.&nbsp; Understand?&nbsp; Oh, they don't fool
me much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie was paying no attention, being intent upon the doors.

<P>The mere boy relapsed into a period of gloom, during which he

<P>exterminated a number of cock-tails with a determined air, as if

<P>replying defiantly to fate.&nbsp; He occasionally broke forth into

<P>sentences composed of invectives joined together in a long string.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl was still staring at the doors.&nbsp; After a time

<P>the mere boy began to see cobwebs just in front of his nose.

<P>He spurred himself into being agreeable and insisted upon her

<P>having a charlotte-russe and a glass of beer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They's gone," he remarked, "they's gone."&nbsp; He looked at her

<P>through the smoke wreaths.&nbsp; "Shay, lil' girl, we mightish well
make

<P>bes' of it.&nbsp; You ain't such bad-lookin' girl, y'know.&nbsp; Not
half

<P>bad.&nbsp; Can't come up to Nell, though.&nbsp; No, can't do it!&nbsp;
Well, I

<P>should shay not!&nbsp; Nell fine-lookin' girl!&nbsp; F--i--n--ine.&nbsp;
You look

<P>damn bad longsider her, but by y'self ain't so bad.&nbsp; Have to do

<P>anyhow.&nbsp; Nell gone.&nbsp; On'y you left.&nbsp; Not half bad, though."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie stood up.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm going home," she said.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mere boy started.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Home," he cried, struck with amazement.

<P>"I beg pardon, did hear say home?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'm going home," she repeated.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Great Gawd, what hava struck," demanded the mere boy of himself, stupefied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a semi-comatose state he conducted her on board an up-town car,

<P>ostentatiously paid her fare, leered kindly at her through the

<P>rear window and fell off the steps.
