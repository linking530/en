<P>The babe, Tommie, died.&nbsp; He went away in a white,

<P>insignificant coffin, his small waxen hand clutching a flower that

<P>the girl, Maggie, had stolen from an Italian.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She and Jimmie lived.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The inexperienced fibres of the boy's eyes were hardened at an

<P>early age.&nbsp; He became a young man of leather.&nbsp; He lived some
red

<P>years without laboring.&nbsp; During that time his sneer became chronic.

<P>He studied human nature in the gutter, and found it no worse than

<P>he thought he had reason to believe it.&nbsp; He never conceived a

<P>respect for the world, because he had begun with no idols that it

<P>had smashed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He clad his soul in armor by means of happening hilariously in

<P>at a mission church where a man composed his sermons of "yous."

<P>While they got warm at the stove, he told his hearers just where he

<P>calculated they stood with the Lord.&nbsp; Many of the sinners were

<P>impatient over the pictured depths of their degradation.&nbsp; They
were

<P>waiting for soup-tickets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A reader of words of wind-demons might have been able to see

<P>the portions of a dialogue pass to and fro between the exhorter and

<P>his hearers.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are damned," said the preacher.&nbsp; And the reader of sounds

<P>might have seen the reply go forth from the ragged people: "Where's

<P>our soup?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie and a companion sat in a rear seat and commented upon

<P>the things that didn't concern them, with all the freedom of

<P>English gentlemen.&nbsp; When they grew thirsty and went out their minds

<P>confused the speaker with Christ.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Momentarily, Jimmie was sullen with thoughts of a hopeless

<P>altitude where grew fruit.&nbsp; His companion said that if he

<P>should ever meet God he would ask for a million dollars and a

<P>bottle of beer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie's occupation for a long time was to stand on streetcorners

<P>and watch the world go by, dreaming blood-red dreams at the passing

<P>of pretty women.&nbsp; He menaced mankind at the intersections of streets.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the corners he was in life and of life.&nbsp; The world was

<P>going on and he was there to perceive it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He maintained a belligerent attitude toward all well-dressed

<P>men.&nbsp; To him fine raiment was allied to weakness, and all good

<P>coats covered faint hearts.&nbsp; He and his order were kings, to a

<P>certain extent, over the men of untarnished clothes, because these

<P>latter dreaded, perhaps, to be either killed or laughed at.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Above all things he despised obvious Christians and ciphers

<P>with the chrysanthemums of aristocracy in their button-holes.&nbsp;
He

<P>considered himself above both of these classes.&nbsp; He was afraid
of

<P>neither the devil nor the leader of society.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he had a dollar in his pocket his satisfaction with existence

<P>was the greatest thing in the world.&nbsp; So, eventually, he felt

<P>obliged to work.&nbsp; His father died and his mother's years were

<P>divided up into periods of thirty days.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He became a truck driver.&nbsp; He was given the charge of a painstaking

<P>pair of horses and a large rattling truck.&nbsp; He invaded the turmoil

<P>and tumble of the down-town streets and learned to breathe maledictory

<P>defiance at the police who occasionally used to climb up, drag him

<P>from his perch and beat him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the lower part of the city he daily involved himself in

<P>hideous tangles.&nbsp; If he and his team chanced to be in the rear
he

<P>preserved a demeanor of serenity, crossing his legs and bursting

<P>forth into yells when foot passengers took dangerous dives beneath

<P>the noses of his champing horses.&nbsp; He smoked his pipe calmly for
he

<P>knew that his pay was marching on.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If in the front and the key-truck of chaos, he entered

<P>terrifically into the quarrel that was raging to and fro among the

<P>drivers on their high seats, and sometimes roared oaths and

<P>violently got himself arrested.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a time his sneer grew so that it turned its glare upon

<P>all things.&nbsp; He became so sharp that he believed in nothing.&nbsp;
To

<P>him the police were always actuated by malignant impulses and the

<P>rest of the world was composed, for the most part, of despicable

<P>creatures who were all trying to take advantage of him and with

<P>whom, in defense, he was obliged to quarrel on all possible

<P>occasions.&nbsp; He himself occupied a down-trodden position that

<P>had a private but distinct element of grandeur in its isolation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The most complete cases of aggravated idiocy were, to his mind,

<P>rampant upon the front platforms of all the street cars.&nbsp; At first

<P>his tongue strove with these beings, but he eventually was superior.

<P>He became immured like an African cow.&nbsp; In him grew a majestic
contempt

<P>for those strings of street cars that followed him like intent bugs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He fell into the habit, when starting on a long journey, of

<P>fixing his eye on a high and distant object, commanding his horses

<P>to begin, and then going into a sort of a trance of observation.

<P>Multitudes of drivers might howl in his rear, and passengers might

<P>load him with opprobrium, he would not awaken until some blue

<P>policeman turned red and began to frenziedly tear bridles and beat

<P>the soft noses of the responsible horses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he paused to contemplate the attitude of the police

<P>toward himself and his fellows, he believed that they were the only

<P>men in the city who had no rights.&nbsp; When driving about, he felt

<P>that he was held liable by the police for anything that might occur

<P>in the streets, and was the common prey of all energetic officials.

<P>In revenge, he resolved never to move out of the way of anything,

<P>until formidable circumstances, or a much larger man than himself

<P>forced him to it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Foot-passengers were mere pestering flies with an insane

<P>disregard for their legs and his convenience.&nbsp; He could not

<P>conceive their maniacal desires to cross the streets.&nbsp; Their

<P>madness smote him with eternal amazement.&nbsp; He was continually

<P>storming at them from his throne.&nbsp; He sat aloft and denounced their

<P>frantic leaps, plunges, dives and straddles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they would thrust at, or parry, the noses of his champing

<P>horses, making them swing their heads and move their feet,

<P>disturbing a solid dreamy repose, he swore at the men as fools,

<P>for he himself could perceive that Providence had caused it clearly

<P>to be written, that he and his team had the unalienable right to stand

<P>in the proper path of the sun chariot, and if they so minded,

<P>obstruct its mission or take a wheel off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And, perhaps, if the god-driver had an ungovernable desire to

<P>step down, put up his flame-colored fists and manfully dispute the

<P>right of way, he would have probably been immediately opposed by a

<P>scowling mortal with two sets of very hard knuckles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is possible, perhaps, that this young man would have

<P>derided, in an axle-wide alley, the approach of a flying ferry

<P>boat.&nbsp; Yet he achieved a respect for a fire engine.&nbsp; As one
charged

<P>toward his truck, he would drive fearfully upon a sidewalk,

<P>threatening untold people with annihilation.&nbsp; When an engine would

<P>strike a mass of blocked trucks, splitting it into fragments, as a

<P>blow annihilates a cake of ice, Jimmie's team could usually be

<P>observed high and safe, with whole wheels, on the sidewalk.

<P>The fearful coming of the engine could break up the most intricate

<P>muddle of heavy vehicles at which the police had been swearing for

<P>the half of an hour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A fire engine was enshrined in his heart as an appalling thing

<P>that he loved with a distant dog-like devotion.&nbsp; They had been

<P>known to overturn street-cars.&nbsp; Those leaping horses, striking

<P>sparks from the cobbles in their forward lunge, were creatures

<P>to be ineffably admired.&nbsp; The clang of the gong pierced his breast

<P>like a noise of remembered war.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When Jimmie was a little boy, he began to be arrested.

<P>Before he reached a great age, he had a fair record.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He developed too great a tendency to climb down from his truck

<P>and fight with other drivers.&nbsp; He had been in quite a number of

<P>miscellaneous fights, and in some general barroom rows that had

<P>become known to the police.&nbsp; Once he had been arrested for

<P>assaulting a Chinaman.&nbsp; Two women in different parts of the city,

<P>and entirely unknown to each other, caused him considerable

<P>annoyance by breaking forth, simultaneously, at fateful intervals,

<P>into wailings about marriage and support and infants.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nevertheless, he had, on a certain star-lit evening, said wonderingly

<P>and quite reverently: "Deh moon looks like hell, don't it?"
