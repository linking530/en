<P>The girl, Maggie, blossomed in a mud puddle.&nbsp; She grew to be

<P>a most rare and wonderful production of a tenement district,

<P>a pretty girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>None of the dirt of Rum Alley seemed to be in her veins.

<P>The philosophers up-stairs, down-stairs and on the same floor,

<P>puzzled over it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When a child, playing and fighting with gamins in the street,

<P>dirt disguised her.&nbsp; Attired in tatters and grime, she went unseen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There came a time, however, when the young men of the vicinity

<P>said: "Dat Johnson goil is a puty good looker."&nbsp; About this period

<P>her brother remarked to her: "Mag, I'll tell yeh dis!&nbsp; See?

<P>Yeh've edder got teh go teh hell or go teh work!"&nbsp; Whereupon she

<P>went to work, having the feminine aversion of going to hell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By a chance, she got a position in an establishment where they

<P>made collars and cuffs.&nbsp; She received a stool and a machine in
a

<P>room where sat twenty girls of various shades of yellow discontent.

<P>She perched on the stool and treadled at her machine all day,

<P>turning out collars, the name of whose brand could be noted for its

<P>irrelevancy to anything in connection with collars.&nbsp; At night she

<P>returned home to her mother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie grew large enough to take the vague position of head of

<P>the family.&nbsp; As incumbent of that office, he stumbled up-stairs

<P>late at night, as his father had done before him.&nbsp; He reeled about

<P>the room, swearing at his relations, or went to sleep on the floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The mother had gradually arisen to that degree of fame that

<P>she could bandy words with her acquaintances among the police-

<P>justices.&nbsp; Court-officials called her by her first name.&nbsp;
When she

<P>appeared they pursued a course which had been theirs for months.

<P>They invariably grinned and cried out: "Hello, Mary, you here

<P>again?"&nbsp; Her grey head wagged in many a court.&nbsp; She always
besieged

<P>the bench with voluble excuses, explanations, apologies and

<P>prayers.&nbsp; Her flaming face and rolling eyes were a sort of familiar

<P>sight on the island.&nbsp; She measured time by means of sprees, and
was

<P>eternally swollen and dishevelled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>One day the young man, Pete, who as a lad had smitten the

<P>Devil's Row urchin in the back of the head and put to flight the

<P>antagonists of his friend, Jimmie, strutted upon the scene.

<P>He met Jimmie one day on the street, promised to take him to

<P>a boxing match in Williamsburg, and called for him in the evening.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie observed Pete.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He sat on a table in the Johnson home and dangled his checked

<P>legs with an enticing nonchalance.&nbsp; His hair was curled down over

<P>his forehead in an oiled bang.&nbsp; His rather pugged nose seemed to

<P>revolt from contact with a bristling moustache of short, wire-like

<P>hairs.&nbsp; His blue double-breasted coat, edged with black braid,

<P>buttoned close to a red puff tie, and his patent-leather shoes

<P>looked like murder-fitted weapons.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His mannerisms stamped him as a man who had a correct sense of

<P>his personal superiority.&nbsp; There was valor and contempt for

<P>circumstances in the glance of his eye.&nbsp; He waved his hands like
a

<P>man of the world, who dismisses religion and philosophy, and says

<P>"Fudge."&nbsp; He had certainly seen everything and with each curl of

<P>his lip, he declared that it amounted to nothing.&nbsp; Maggie

<P>thought he must be a very elegant and graceful bartender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was telling tales to Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie watched him furtively, with half-closed eyes, lit with

<P>a vague interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hully gee!&nbsp; Dey makes me tired," he said.&nbsp; "Mos' e'ry day

<P>some farmer comes in an' tries teh run deh shop.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; But
dey

<P>gits t'rowed right out!&nbsp; I jolt dem right out in deh street before

<P>dey knows where dey is!&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure," said Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dere was a mug come in deh place deh odder day wid an idear

<P>he wus goin' teh own deh place!&nbsp; Hully gee, he wus goin' teh own

<P>deh place!&nbsp; I see he had a still on an' I didn' wanna giv 'im no

<P>stuff, so I says: 'Git deh hell outa here an' don' make no

<P>trouble,' I says like dat!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'Git deh hell outa here
an' don'

<P>make no trouble'; like dat.&nbsp; 'Git deh hell outa here,' I says.&nbsp;
See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie nodded understandingly.&nbsp; Over his features played an

<P>eager desire to state the amount of his valor in a similar crisis,

<P>but the narrator proceeded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, deh blokie he says: 'T'hell wid it!&nbsp; I ain' lookin' for

<P>no scrap,' he says (See?), 'but' he says, 'I'm 'spectable cit'zen

<P>an' I wanna drink an' purtydamnsoon, too.'&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'Deh hell,'
I

<P>says.&nbsp; Like dat!&nbsp; 'Deh hell,' I says.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'Don'
make no

<P>trouble,' I says.&nbsp; Like dat.&nbsp; 'Don' make no trouble.'&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; Den

<P>deh mug he squared off an' said he was fine as silk wid his dukes

<P>(See?) an' he wanned a drink damnquick.&nbsp; Dat's what he said.&nbsp;
See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sure," repeated Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pete continued.&nbsp; "Say, I jes' jumped deh bar an' deh way I

<P>plunked dat blokie was great.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Dat's right!&nbsp; In
deh jaw!

<P>See?&nbsp; Hully gee, he t'rowed a spittoon true deh front windee.&nbsp;
Say,

<P>I taut I'd drop dead.&nbsp; But deh boss, he comes in after an' he says,

<P>'Pete, yehs done jes' right!&nbsp; Yeh've gota keep order an' it's all

<P>right.'&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'It's all right,' he says.&nbsp; Dat's what
he said."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The two held a technical discussion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dat bloke was a dandy," said Pete, in conclusion, "but he

<P>hadn' oughta made no trouble.&nbsp; Dat's what I says teh dem: 'Don'

<P>come in here an' make no trouble,' I says, like dat.&nbsp; 'Don' make
no

<P>trouble.'&nbsp; See?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As Jimmie and his friend exchanged tales descriptive of their

<P>prowess, Maggie leaned back in the shadow.&nbsp; Her eyes dwelt

<P>wonderingly and rather wistfully upon Pete's face.&nbsp; The broken

<P>furniture, grimey walls, and general disorder and dirt of her home

<P>of a sudden appeared before her and began to take a

<P>potential aspect.&nbsp; Pete's aristocratic person looked as if it might

<P>soil.&nbsp; She looked keenly at him, occasionally, wondering if he
was

<P>feeling contempt.&nbsp; But Pete seemed to be enveloped in reminiscence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Hully gee," said he, "dose mugs can't phase me.&nbsp; Dey knows I

<P>kin wipe up deh street wid any t'ree of dem."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he said, "Ah, what deh hell," his voice was burdened with

<P>disdain for the inevitable and contempt for anything that fate

<P>might compel him to endure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie perceived that here was the beau ideal of a man.&nbsp; Her

<P>dim thoughts were often searching for far away lands where, as God

<P>says, the little hills sing together in the morning.&nbsp; Under the

<P>trees of her dream-gardens there had always walked a lover.
