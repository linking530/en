<P>In a room a woman sat at a table eating like a fat monk in a picture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A soiled, unshaven man pushed open the door and entered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said he, "Mag's dead."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What?" said the woman, her mouth filled with bread.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mag's dead," repeated the man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Deh hell she is," said the woman.&nbsp; She continued her meal.

<P>When she finished her coffee she began to weep.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kin remember when her two feet was no bigger dan yer t'umb,

<P>and she weared worsted boots," moaned she.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, whata dat?" said the man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots," she cried.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The neighbors began to gather in the hall, staring in at the

<P>weeping woman as if watching the contortions of a dying dog.&nbsp; A

<P>dozen women entered and lamented with her.&nbsp; Under their busy hands

<P>the rooms took on that appalling appearance of neatness and order

<P>with which death is greeted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly the door opened and a woman in a black gown rushed in

<P>with outstretched arms.&nbsp; "Ah, poor Mary," she cried, and tenderly

<P>embraced the moaning one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, what ter'ble affliction is dis," continued she.&nbsp; Her vocabulary

<P>was derived from mission churches.&nbsp; "Me poor Mary, how I feel fer
yehs!

<P>Ah, what a ter'ble affliction is a disobed'ent chil'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her good, motherly face was wet with tears.&nbsp; She trembled in

<P>eagerness to express her sympathy.&nbsp; The mourner sat with bowed
head,

<P>rocking her body heavily to and fro, and crying out in a high,

<P>strained voice that sounded like a dirge on some forlorn pipe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots an' her two

<P>feets was no bigger dan yer t'umb an' she weared worsted boots,

<P>Miss Smith," she cried, raising her streaming eyes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, me poor Mary," sobbed the woman in black.&nbsp; With low,

<P>coddling cries, she sank on her knees by the mourner's chair,

<P>and put her arms about her.&nbsp; The other women began to groan

<P>in different keys.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yer poor misguided chil' is gone now, Mary, an' let us hope

<P>it's fer deh bes'.&nbsp; Yeh'll fergive her now, Mary, won't yehs, dear,

<P>all her disobed'ence?&nbsp; All her t'ankless behavior to her mudder
an'

<P>all her badness?&nbsp; She's gone where her ter'ble sins will be judged."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman in black raised her face and paused.&nbsp; The inevitable

<P>sunlight came streaming in at the windows and shed a ghastly

<P>cheerfulness upon the faded hues of the room.&nbsp; Two or three of
the

<P>spectators were sniffling, and one was loudly weeping.&nbsp; The

<P>mourner arose and staggered into the other room.&nbsp; In a moment she

<P>emerged with a pair of faded baby shoes held in the hollow of her hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I kin remember when she used to wear dem," cried she.

<P>The women burst anew into cries as if they had all been stabbed.

<P>The mourner turned to the soiled and unshaven man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Jimmie, boy, go git yer sister!&nbsp; Go git yer sister an' we'll

<P>put deh boots on her feets!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dey won't fit her now, yeh damn fool," said the man.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go git yer sister, Jimmie," shrieked the woman, confronting

<P>him fiercely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man swore sullenly.&nbsp; He went over to a corner and slowly

<P>began to put on his coat.&nbsp; He took his hat and went out, with a

<P>dragging, reluctant step.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman in black came forward and again besought the mourner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh'll fergive her, Mary!&nbsp; Yeh'll fergive yer bad, bad,

<P>chil'!&nbsp; Her life was a curse an' her days were black an' yeh'll

<P>fergive yer bad girl?&nbsp; She's gone where her sins will be judged."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She's gone where her sins will be judged," cried the other

<P>women, like a choir at a funeral.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," said the woman in

<P>black, raising her eyes to the sunbeams.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," responded the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yeh'll fergive her, Mary!" pleaded the woman in black.&nbsp; The

<P>mourner essayed to speak but her voice gave way.&nbsp; She shook her

<P>great shoulders frantically, in an agony of grief.&nbsp; Hot tears

<P>seemed to scald her quivering face.&nbsp; Finally her voice came and

<P>arose like a scream of pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, yes, I'll fergive her!&nbsp; I'll fergive her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
