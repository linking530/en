<P>Jimmie and the old woman listened long in the hall.&nbsp; Above the

<P>muffled roar of conversation, the dismal wailings of babies at

<P>night, the thumping of feet in unseen corridors and rooms, mingled

<P>with the sound of varied hoarse shoutings in the street and the

<P>rattling of wheels over cobbles, they heard the screams of the

<P>child and the roars of the mother die away to a feeble moaning and

<P>a subdued bass muttering.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The old woman was a gnarled and leathery personage who could

<P>don, at will, an expression of great virtue.&nbsp; She possessed a small

<P>music-box capable of one tune, and a collection of "God bless yehs"

<P>pitched in assorted keys of fervency.&nbsp; Each day she took a position

<P>upon the stones of Fifth Avenue, where she crooked her legs under

<P>her and crouched immovable and hideous, like an idol.&nbsp; She received

<P>daily a small sum in pennies.&nbsp; It was contributed, for the most

<P>part, by persons who did not make their homes in that vicinity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Once, when a lady had dropped her purse on the sidewalk, the

<P>gnarled woman had grabbed it and smuggled it with great dexterity

<P>beneath her cloak.&nbsp; When she was arrested she had cursed the lady

<P>into a partial swoon, and with her aged limbs, twisted from

<P>rheumatism, had almost kicked the stomach out of a huge policeman

<P>whose conduct upon that occasion she referred to when she said:

<P>"The police, damn 'em."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Eh, Jimmie, it's cursed shame," she said.&nbsp; "Go, now, like a dear

<P>an' buy me a can, an' if yer mudder raises 'ell all night yehs

<P>can sleep here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie took a tendered tin-pail and seven pennies and departed.

<P>He passed into the side door of a saloon and went to the bar.

<P>Straining up on his toes he raised the pail and pennies as high

<P>as his arms would let him.&nbsp; He saw two hands thrust down and take
them.

<P>Directly the same hands let down the filled pail and he left.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In front of the gruesome doorway he met a lurching figure.

<P>It was his father, swaying about on uncertain legs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Give me deh can.&nbsp; See?" said the man, threateningly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, come off!&nbsp; I got dis can fer dat ol' woman an' it 'ud be

<P>dirt teh swipe it.&nbsp; See?" cried Jimmie.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The father wrenched the pail from the urchin.&nbsp; He grasped it

<P>in both hands and lifted it to his mouth.&nbsp; He glued his lips to
the

<P>under edge and tilted his head.&nbsp; His hairy throat swelled until
it

<P>seemed to grow near his chin.&nbsp; There was a tremendous gulping

<P>movement and the beer was gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man caught his breath and laughed.&nbsp; He hit his son on the

<P>head with the empty pail.&nbsp; As it rolled clanging into the street,

<P>Jimmie began to scream and kicked repeatedly at his father's shins.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Look at deh dirt what yeh done me," he yelled.&nbsp; "Deh ol'

<P>woman 'ill be raisin' hell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He retreated to the middle of the street, but the man did not

<P>pursue.&nbsp; He staggered toward the door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I'll club hell outa yeh when I ketch yeh," he shouted, and

<P>disappeared.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>During the evening he had been standing against a bar drinking

<P>whiskies and declaring to all comers, confidentially: "My home

<P>reg'lar livin' hell!&nbsp; Damndes' place!&nbsp; Reg'lar hell!&nbsp;
Why do I come

<P>an' drin' whisk' here thish way?&nbsp; 'Cause home reg'lar livin' hell!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie waited a long time in the street and then crept warily

<P>up through the building.&nbsp; He passed with great caution the door
of

<P>the gnarled woman, and finally stopped outside his home and listened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He could hear his mother moving heavily about among the

<P>furniture of the room.&nbsp; She was chanting in a mournful voice,

<P>occasionally interjecting bursts of volcanic wrath at the father,

<P>who, Jimmie judged, had sunk down on the floor or in a corner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why deh blazes don' chere try teh keep Jim from fightin'?

<P>I'll break her jaw," she suddenly bellowed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The man mumbled with drunken indifference.&nbsp; "Ah, wha' deh

<P>hell.&nbsp; W'a's odds?&nbsp; Wha' makes kick?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Because he tears 'is clothes, yeh damn fool," cried the woman

<P>in supreme wrath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The husband seemed to become aroused.&nbsp; "Go teh hell," he

<P>thundered fiercely in reply.&nbsp; There was a crash against the door

<P>and something broke into clattering fragments.&nbsp; Jimmie partially

<P>suppressed a howl and darted down the stairway.&nbsp; Below he paused

<P>and listened.&nbsp; He heard howls and curses, groans and shrieks,

<P>confusingly in chorus as if a battle were raging.&nbsp; With all was
the

<P>crash of splintering furniture.&nbsp; The eyes of the urchin glared
in

<P>fear that one of them would discover him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Curious faces appeared in doorways, and whispered comments

<P>passed to and fro.&nbsp; "Ol' Johnson's raisin' hell agin."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie stood until the noises ceased and the other inhabitants

<P>of the tenement had all yawned and shut their doors.&nbsp; Then he

<P>crawled upstairs with the caution of an invader of a panther den.

<P>Sounds of labored breathing came through the broken door-panels.

<P>He pushed the door open and entered, quaking.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A glow from the fire threw red hues over the bare floor, the cracked

<P>and soiled plastering, and the overturned and broken furniture.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the middle of the floor lay his mother asleep.&nbsp; In one

<P>corner of the room his father's limp body hung across the seat

<P>of a chair.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The urchin stole forward.&nbsp; He began to shiver in dread of

<P>awakening his parents.&nbsp; His mother's great chest was heaving

<P>painfully.&nbsp; Jimmie paused and looked down at her.&nbsp; Her face
was

<P>inflamed and swollen from drinking.&nbsp; Her yellow brows shaded eye-

<P>lids that had brown blue.&nbsp; Her tangled hair tossed in waves over

<P>her forehead.&nbsp; Her mouth was set in the same lines of vindictive

<P>hatred that it had, perhaps, borne during the fight.&nbsp; Her bare,

<P>red arms were thrown out above her head in positions of exhaustion,

<P>something, mayhap, like those of a sated villain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The urchin bended over his mother.&nbsp; He was fearful lest she

<P>should open her eyes, and the dread within him was so strong,

<P>that he could not forbear to stare, but hung as if fascinated

<P>over the woman's grim face.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Suddenly her eyes opened.&nbsp; The urchin found himself looking

<P>straight into that expression, which, it would seem, had the power

<P>to change his blood to salt.&nbsp; He howled piercingly and fell

<P>backward.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman floundered for a moment, tossed her arms about her

<P>head as if in combat, and again began to snore.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie crawled back in the shadows and waited.&nbsp; A noise in the

<P>next room had followed his cry at the discovery that his mother was

<P>awake.&nbsp; He grovelled in the gloom, the eyes from out his drawn
face

<P>riveted upon the intervening door.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He heard it creak, and then the sound of a small voice came to

<P>him.&nbsp; "Jimmie!&nbsp; Jimmie!&nbsp; Are yehs dere?" it whispered.&nbsp;
The urchin

<P>started.&nbsp; The thin, white face of his sister looked at him from
the

<P>door-way of the other room.&nbsp; She crept to him across the floor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The father had not moved, but lay in the same death-like

<P>sleep.&nbsp; The mother writhed in uneasy slumber, her chest wheezing
as

<P>if she were in the agonies of strangulation.&nbsp; Out at the window
a

<P>florid moon was peering over dark roofs, and in the distance the

<P>waters of a river glimmered pallidly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The small frame of the ragged girl was quivering.&nbsp; Her

<P>features were haggard from weeping, and her eyes gleamed from fear.

<P>She grasped the urchin's arm in her little trembling hands and they

<P>huddled in a corner.&nbsp; The eyes of both were drawn, by some force,

<P>to stare at the woman's face, for they thought she need only to

<P>awake and all fiends would come from below.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They crouched until the ghost-mists of dawn appeared at the

<P>window, drawing close to the panes, and looking in at the

<P>prostrate, heaving body of the mother.
