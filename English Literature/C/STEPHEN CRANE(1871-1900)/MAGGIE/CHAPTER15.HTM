<P>A forlorn woman went along a lighted avenue.&nbsp; The street was

<P>filled with people desperately bound on missions.&nbsp; An endless crowd

<P>darted at the elevated station stairs and the horse cars were

<P>thronged with owners of bundles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The pace of the forlorn woman was slow.&nbsp; She was apparently

<P>searching for some one.&nbsp; She loitered near the doors of saloons
and

<P>watched men emerge from them.&nbsp; She scanned furtively the faces
in

<P>the rushing stream of pedestrians.&nbsp; Hurrying men, bent on catching

<P>some boat or train, jostled her elbows, failing to notice her,

<P>their thoughts fixed on distant dinners.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The forlorn woman had a peculiar face.&nbsp; Her smile was no

<P>smile.&nbsp; But when in repose her features had a shadowy look that
was

<P>like a sardonic grin, as if some one had sketched with cruel

<P>forefinger indelible lines about her mouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie came strolling up the avenue.&nbsp; The woman encountered

<P>him with an aggrieved air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, Jimmie, I've been lookin' all over fer yehs--," she began.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie made an impatient gesture and quickened his pace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, don't bodder me!&nbsp; Good Gawd!" he said, with the

<P>savageness of a man whose life is pestered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman followed him along the sidewalk in somewhat the

<P>manner of a suppliant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, Jimmie," she said, "yehs told me ye'd--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie turned upon her fiercely as if resolved to make a last

<P>stand for comfort and peace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Say, fer Gawd's sake, Hattie, don' foller me from one end of

<P>deh city teh deh odder.&nbsp; Let up, will yehs!&nbsp; Give me a minute's

<P>res', can't yehs?&nbsp; Yehs makes me tired, allus taggin' me.&nbsp;
See?

<P>Ain' yehs got no sense.&nbsp; Do yehs want people teh get onto me?

<P>Go chase yerself, fer Gawd's sake."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The woman stepped closer and laid her fingers on his arm.

<P>"But, look-a-here--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Jimmie snarled.&nbsp; "Oh, go teh hell."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He darted into the front door of a convenient saloon and a

<P>moment later came out into the shadows that surrounded the side

<P>door.&nbsp; On the brilliantly lighted avenue he perceived the forlorn

<P>woman dodging about like a scout.&nbsp; Jimmie laughed with an air of

<P>relief and went away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When he arrived home he found his mother clamoring.

<P>Maggie had returned.&nbsp; She stood shivering beneath the torrent

<P>of her mother's wrath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, I'm damned," said Jimmie in greeting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His mother, tottering about the room, pointed a quivering

<P>forefinger.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lookut her, Jimmie, lookut her.&nbsp; Dere's yer sister, boy.

<P>Dere's yer sister.&nbsp; Lookut her!&nbsp; Lookut her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She screamed in scoffing laughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl stood in the middle of the room.&nbsp; She edged about as

<P>if unable to find a place on the floor to put her feet.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ha, ha, ha," bellowed the mother.&nbsp; "Dere she stands!&nbsp; Ain'

<P>she purty?&nbsp; Lookut her!&nbsp; Ain' she sweet, deh beast?&nbsp;
Lookut her!

<P>Ha, ha, lookut her!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She lurched forward and put her red and seamed hands upon her

<P>daughter's face.&nbsp; She bent down and peered keenly up into the eyes

<P>of the girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, she's jes' dessame as she ever was, ain' she?&nbsp; She's her

<P>mudder's purty darlin' yit, ain' she?&nbsp; Lookut her, Jimmie!&nbsp;
Come

<P>here, fer Gawd's sake, and lookut her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loud, tremendous sneering of the mother brought the

<P>denizens of the Rum Alley tenement to their doors.&nbsp; Women came
in

<P>the hallways.&nbsp; Children scurried to and fro.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What's up?&nbsp; Dat Johnson party on anudder tear?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Naw!&nbsp; Young Mag's come home!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Deh hell yeh say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Through the open door curious eyes stared in at Maggie.

<P>Children ventured into the room and ogled her, as if they formed

<P>the front row at a theatre.&nbsp; Women, without, bended toward each

<P>other and whispered, nodding their heads with airs of profound

<P>philosophy.&nbsp; A baby, overcome with curiosity concerning this object

<P>at which all were looking, sidled forward and touched her dress,

<P>cautiously, as if investigating a red-hot stove.&nbsp; Its mother's

<P>voice rang out like a warning trumpet.&nbsp; She rushed forward and

<P>grabbed her child, casting a terrible look of indignation at the girl.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie's mother paced to and fro, addressing the doorful of

<P>eyes, expounding like a glib showman at a museum.&nbsp; Her voice rang

<P>through the building.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dere she stands," she cried, wheeling suddenly and pointing

<P>with dramatic finger.&nbsp; "Dere she stands!&nbsp; Lookut her!&nbsp;
Ain' she a

<P>dindy?&nbsp; An' she was so good as to come home teh her mudder, she

<P>was!&nbsp; Ain' she a beaut'?&nbsp; Ain' she a dindy?&nbsp; Fer Gawd's
sake!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The jeering cries ended in another burst of shrill laughter.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl seemed to awaken.&nbsp; "Jimmie--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He drew hastily back from her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, now, yer a hell of a t'ing, ain' yeh?" he said, his

<P>lips curling in scorn.&nbsp; Radiant virtue sat upon his brow and his

<P>repelling hands expressed horror of contamination.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie turned and went.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The crowd at the door fell back precipitately.&nbsp; A baby falling

<P>down in front of the door, wrenched a scream like a wounded animal

<P>from its mother.&nbsp; Another woman sprang forward and picked it up,

<P>with a chivalrous air, as if rescuing a human being from an

<P>oncoming express train.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the girl passed down through the hall, she went before open

<P>doors framing more eyes strangely microscopic, and sending broad

<P>beams of inquisitive light into the darkness of her path.&nbsp; On the

<P>second floor she met the gnarled old woman who possessed the music box.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So," she cried, "'ere yehs are back again, are yehs?&nbsp; An'

<P>dey've kicked yehs out?&nbsp; Well, come in an' stay wid me teh-night.

<P>I ain' got no moral standin'."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From above came an unceasing babble of tongues, over all of

<P>which rang the mother's derisive laughter.
