<P>As thoughts of Pete came to Maggie's mind, she began to have

<P>an intense dislike for all of her dresses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell ails yeh?&nbsp; What makes yeh be allus fixin' and

<P>fussin'?&nbsp; Good Gawd," her mother would frequently roar at her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She began to note, with more interest, the well-dressed women

<P>she met on the avenues.&nbsp; She envied elegance and soft palms.&nbsp;
She

<P>craved those adornments of person which she saw every day on the

<P>street, conceiving them to be allies of vast importance to women.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Studying faces, she thought many of the women and girls she

<P>chanced to meet, smiled with serenity as though forever cherished

<P>and watched over by those they loved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The air in the collar and cuff establishment strangled her.

<P>She knew she was gradually and surely shrivelling in the hot,

<P>stuffy room.&nbsp; The begrimed windows rattled incessantly from the

<P>passing of elevated trains.&nbsp; The place was filled with a whirl
of

<P>noises and odors.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She wondered as she regarded some of the grizzled women in the

<P>room, mere mechanical contrivances sewing seams and grinding out,

<P>with heads bended over their work, tales of imagined or real

<P>girlhood happiness, past drunks, the baby at home, and unpaid wages.

<P>She speculated how long her youth would endure.&nbsp; She began to see

<P>the bloom upon her cheeks as valuable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She imagined herself, in an exasperating future, as a scrawny

<P>woman with an eternal grievance.&nbsp; Too, she thought Pete to be

<P>a very fastidious person concerning the appearance of women.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She felt she would love to see somebody entangle their fingers

<P>in the oily beard of the fat foreigner who owned the establishment.

<P>He was a detestable creature.&nbsp; He wore white socks with low shoes.

<P>When he tired of this amusement he would go to the mummies and

<P>moralize over them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Usually he submitted with silent dignity to all which he had

<P>to go through, but, at times, he was goaded into comment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What deh hell," he demanded once.&nbsp; "Look at all dese little

<P>jugs!&nbsp; Hundred jugs in a row!&nbsp; Ten rows in a case an' 'bout
a

<P>t'ousand cases!&nbsp; What deh blazes use is dem?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Evenings during the week he took her to see plays in which the

<P>brain-clutching heroine was rescued from the palatial home of her

<P>guardian, who is cruelly after her bonds, by the hero with the

<P>beautiful sentiments.&nbsp; The latter spent most of his time out at

<P>soak in pale-green snow storms, busy with a nickel-plated revolver,

<P>rescuing aged strangers from villains.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie lost herself in sympathy with the wanderers swooning in

<P>snow storms beneath happy-hued church windows.&nbsp; And a choir within

<P>singing "Joy to the World."&nbsp; To Maggie and the rest of the audience

<P>this was transcendental realism.&nbsp; Joy always within, and they,
like

<P>the actor, inevitably without.&nbsp; Viewing it, they hugged themselves

<P>in ecstatic pity of their imagined or real condition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The girl thought the arrogance and granite-heartedness of the

<P>magnate of the play was very accurately drawn.&nbsp; She echoed the

<P>maledictions that the occupants of the gallery showered on this

<P>individual when his lines compelled him to expose his extreme

<P>selfishness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Shady persons in the audience revolted from the pictured

<P>villainy of the drama.&nbsp; With untiring zeal they hissed vice and

<P>applauded virtue.&nbsp; Unmistakably bad men evinced an apparently

<P>sincere admiration for virtue.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loud gallery was overwhelmingly with the unfortunate and the

<P>oppressed.&nbsp; They encouraged the struggling hero with cries, and

<P>jeered the villain, hooting and calling attention to his whiskers.

<P>When anybody died in the pale-green snow storms, the gallery mourned.

<P>They sought out the painted misery and hugged it as akin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the hero's erratic march from poverty in the first act, to

<P>wealth and triumph in the final one, in which he forgives all the

<P>enemies that he has left, he was assisted by the gallery, which

<P>applauded his generous and noble sentiments and confounded the

<P>speeches of his opponents by making irrelevant but very sharp

<P>remarks.&nbsp; Those actors who were cursed with villainy parts were

<P>confronted at every turn by the gallery.&nbsp; If one of them rendered

<P>lines containing the most subtile distinctions between right and

<P>wrong, the gallery was immediately aware if the actor meant

<P>wickedness, and denounced him accordingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The last act was a triumph for the hero, poor and of the

<P>masses, the representative of the audience, over the villain

<P>and the rich man, his pockets stuffed with bonds, his heart packed

<P>with tyrannical purposes, imperturbable amid suffering.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maggie always departed with raised spirits from the showing

<P>places of the melodrama.&nbsp; She rejoiced at the way in which the
poor

<P>and virtuous eventually surmounted the wealthy and wicked.&nbsp; The

<P>theatre made her think.&nbsp; She wondered if the culture and refinement

<P>she had seen imitated, perhaps grotesquely, by the heroine on the

<P>stage, could be acquired by a girl who lived in a tenement house

<P>and worked in a shirt factory.
