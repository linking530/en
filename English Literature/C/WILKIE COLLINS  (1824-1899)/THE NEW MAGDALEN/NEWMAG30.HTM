<P>CONTAINING SELECTIONS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY
AND MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT; TO WHICH ARE ADDED EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF
THE REVEREND JULIAN GRAY.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>I.</CENTER>


<P><I>From</I> MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT <I>to</I> MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY.

<P>"I HASTEN to thank you, dear Miss Roseberry, for your last kind letter,
received by yesterday's mail from Canada. Believe me, I appreciate your
generous readiness to pardon and forget what I so rudely said to you at
a time when the arts of an adventuress had blinded me to the truth. In
the grace which has forgiven me I recognize the inbred sense of justice
of a true lady. Birth and breeding can never fail to assert themselves:
I believe in them, thank God, more firmly than ever.

<P>"You ask me to keep you informed of the progress of Julian Gray's infatuation,
and of the course of conduct pursued toward him by Mercy Merrick.

<P>"If you had not favored me by explaining your object, I might have felt
some surprise at receiving from a lady in your position such a request
as this. But the motives by which you describe yourself as being actuated
are beyond dispute. The existence of Society, as you truly&nbsp;<!--577-->say,
is threatened by the present lamentable prevalence of Liberal ideas throughout
the length and breadth of the land. We can only hope to protect ourselves
against impostors interested in gaining a position among persons of our
rank by becoming in some sort (unpleasant as it may be) familiar with the
arts by which imposture too frequently succeeds. If we wish to know to
what daring lengths cunning can go, to what pitiable self-delusion credulity
can consent, we must watch the proceedings--even while we shrink from them--of
a Mercy Merrick and a Julian Gray.

<P>"In taking up my narrative again where my last letter left off, I must
venture to set you right on one point.

<P>"Certain expressions which have escaped your pen suggest to me that
you blame Julian Gray as the cause of Lady Janet's regrettable visit to
the Refuge the day after Mercy Merrick had left her house. This is not
quite correct. Julian, as you will presently see, has enough to answer
for without being held responsible for errors of judgment in which he has
had no share. Lady Janet (as she herself told me) went to the Refuge of
her own free-will to ask Mercy Merrick's pardon for the language which
she had used on the previous day. 'I passed a night of such misery as no
words can describe'--this, I assure you, is what her ladyship really said
to me--'thinking over what my vile pride and selfishness and obstinacy
had made me say and do. I would have gone down on my knees to beg her pardon
if she&nbsp;<!--578-->would have let me. My first happy moment was when
I won her consent to come and visit me sometimes at Mablethorpe House.'

<P>"You will, I am sure, agree with me that such extravagance as this is
to be pitied rather than blamed. How sad to see the decay of the faculties
with advancing age! It is a matter of grave anxiety to consider how much
longer poor Lady Janet can be trusted to manage her own affairs. I shall
take an opportunity of touching on the matter delicately when I next see
her lawyer.

<P>"I am straying from my subject. And--is it not strange?--I am writing
to you as confidentially as if we were old friends

<P>"To return to Julian Gray. Innocent of instigating his aunt's first
visit to the Refuge, he is guilty of having induced her to go there for
the second time the day after I had dispatched my last letter to you. Lady
Janet's object on this occasion was neither more nor less than to plead
her nephew's cause as humble suitor for the hand of Mercy Merrick. Imagine
the descent of one of the oldest families in England inviting an adventuress
in a Refuge to honor a clergyman of the Church of England by becoming his
wife! In what times do we live! My dear mother shed tears of shame when
she heard of it. How you would love and admire my mother!

<P>"I dined at Mablethorpe House, by previous appointment, on the day when
Lady Janet returned from her degrading errand.

<P>"'Well?' I said, waiting, of course, until the servant was out of the
room.

<P><!--579-->"'Well,' Lady Janet answered, 'Julian was quite right.'

<P>"'Quite right in what?'

<P>"'In saying that the earth holds no nobler woman than Mercy Merrick.'

<P>"'Has she refused him again?'

<P>"'She has refused him again.'

<P>"'Thank God!' I felt it fervently, and I said it fervently. Lady Janet
laid down her knife and fork, and fixed one of her fierce looks on me.

<P>"'It may not be your fault, Horace,' she said, 'if your nature is incapable
of comprehending what is great and generous in other natures higher than
yours. But the least you can do is to distrust your own capacity of appreciation.
For the future keep your opinions (on questions which you don't understand)
modestly to yourself. I have a tenderness for you for your father's sake;
and I take the most favorable view of your conduct toward Mercy Merrick.
I humanely consider it the conduct of a fool.' (Her own words, Miss Roseberry.
I assure you once more, her own words.) 'But don't trespass too far on
my indulgence--don't insinuate again that a woman who is good enough (if
she died this night) to go to heaven, is <I>not</I> good enough to be my
nephew's wife.'

<P>"I expressed to you my conviction a little way back that it was doubtful
whether poor Lady Janet would be much longer competent to manage her own
affairs. Perhaps you thought me hasty then? What do you think now?

<P>"It was, of course, useless to reply seriously&nbsp;<!--580-->to the
extraordinary reprimand that I had received. Besides, I was really shocked
by a decay of principle which proceeded but too plainly from decay of the
mental powers. I made a soothing and respectful reply, and I was favored
in return with some account of what had really happened at the Refuge.
My mother and my sisters were disgusted when I repeated the particulars
to them. You will be disgusted too.

<P>"The interesting penitent (expecting Lady Janet's visit) was, of course,
discovered in a touching domestic position! She had a foundling baby asleep
on her lap; and she was teaching the alphabet to an ugly little vagabond
girl whose acquaintance she had first made in the street. Just the sort
of artful <I>tableau vivant</I> to impose on an old lady--was it not?

<P>"You will understand what followed, when Lady Janet opened her matrimonial
negotiation. Having perfected herself in her part, Mercy Merrick, to do
her justice, was not the woman to play it badly. The most magnanimous sentiments
flowed from her lips. She declared that her future life was devoted to
acts of charity, typified, of course, by the foundling infant and the ugly
little girl. However she might personally suffer, whatever might be the
sacrifice of her own feelings--observe how artfully this was put, to insinuate
that she was herself in love with him!--she could not accept from Mr. Julian
Gray an honor of which she was unworthy. Her gratitude to him and her interest
in him alike forbade her to compromise his brilliant future by consent<!--581-->ing
to a marriage which would degrade him in the estimation of all his friends.
She thanked him (with tears); she thanked Lady Janet (with more tears);
but she dare not, in the interests of <I>his</I> honor and <I>his</I> happiness,
accept the hand that he offered to her. God bless and comfort him; and
God help her to bear with her hard lot!

<P>"The object of this contemptible comedy is plain enough to my mind.
She is simply holding off (Julian, as you know, is a poor man) until the
influence of Lady Janet's persuasion is backed by the opening of Lady Janet's
purse. In one word--Settlements! But for the profanity of the woman's language,
and the really lamentable credulity of the poor old lady, the whole thing
would make a fit subject for a burlesque.

<P>"But the saddest part of the story is still to come.

<P>"In due course of time the lady's decision was communicated to Julian
Gray. He took leave of his senses on the spot. Can you believe it?-- he
has resigned his curacy! At a time when the church is thronged every Sunday
to hear him preach, this madman shuts the door and walks out of the pulpit.
Even Lady Janet was not far enough gone in folly to abet him in this. She
remonstrated, like the rest of his friends. Perfectly useless! He had but
one answer to everything they could say: 'My career is closed.' What stuff!

<P>"You will ask, naturally enough, what this perverse man is going to
do next. I don't&nbsp;<!--582-->scruple to say that he is bent on committing
suicide. Pray do not be alarmed! There is no fear of the pistol, the rope,
or the river. Julian is simply courting death--within the limits of the
law.

<P>"This is strong language, I know. You shall hear what the facts are,
and judge for yourself.

<P>"Having resigned his curacy, his next proceeding was to offer his services,
as volunteer, to a new missionary enterprise on the West Coast of Africa.
The persons at the head of the mission proved, most fortunately, to have
a proper sense of their duty. Expressing their conviction of the value
of Julian's assistance in the most handsome terms, they made it nevertheless
a condition of entertaining his proposal that he should submit to examination
by a competent medical man. After some hesitation he consented to this.
The doctor's report was conclusive. In Julian's present state of health
the climate of West Africa would in all probability kill him in three months'
time.

<P>"Foiled in his first attempt, he addressed himself next to a London
Mission. Here it was impossible to raise the question of climate, and here,
I grieve to say, he has succeeded.

<P>"He is now working--in other words, he is now deliberately risking his
life--in the Mission to Green Anchor Fields. The district known by this
name is situated in a remote part of London, near the Thames. It is notoriously
infested by the most desperate and degraded set of wretches in the whole
metropolitan population, and it is&nbsp;<!--583-->so thickly inhabited
that it is hardly ever completely free from epidemic disease. In this horrible
place, and among these dangerous people, Julian is now employing himself
from morning to night. None of his old friends ever see him. Since he joined
the Mission he has not even called on Lady Janet Roy.

<P>"My pledge is redeemed--the facts are before you. Am I wrong in taking
my gloomy view of the prospect? I cannot forget that this unhappy man was
once my friend, and I really see no hope for him in the future. Deliberately
self-exposed to the violence of ruffians and the outbreak of disease, who
is to extricate him from his shocking position? The one person who can
do it is the person whose association with him would be his ruin--Mercy
Merrick. Heaven only knows what disasters it may be my painful duty to
communicate to you in my next letter!

<P>"You are so kind as to ask me to tell you something about myself and
my plans.

<P>"I have very little to say on either head. After what I have suffered--my
feelings trampled on, my confidence betrayed--I am as yet hardly capable
of deciding what I shall do. Returning to my old profession--to the army--is
out of the question, in these leveling days, when any obscure person who
can pass an examination may call himself my brother officer, and may one
day, perhaps, command me as my superior in rank. If I think of any career,
it is the career of diplomacy. Birth and breeding have not quite disappeared
as essential qualifications in <I>that</I> branch&nbsp;<!--584-->of the
public service. But I have decided nothing as yet.

<P>"My mother and sisters, in the event of your returning to England, desire
me to say that it will afford them the greatest pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Sympathizing with me, they do not forget what you too have suffered. A
warm welcome awaits you when you pay your first visit at our house. Most
truly yours,

<P>"HORACE HOLMCROFT."

<CENTER>II.</CENTER>


<P><I>From</I> MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY <I>to</I> MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT.

<P>"DEAR MR. HOLMCROFT--I snatch a few moments from my other avocations
to thank you for your most interesting and delightful letter. How well
you describe, how accurately you judge! If Literature stood a little higher
as a profession, I should almost advise you--but no! if you entered Literature,
how could <I>you</I> associate with the people whom you would be likely
to meet?

<P>"Between ourselves, I always thought Mr. Julian Gray an overrated man.
I will not say he has justified my opinion. I will only say I pity him.
But, dear Mr. Holmcroft, how can you, with your sound judgment, place the
sad alternatives now before him on the same level? To die in Green Anchor
Fields, or to fall into the clutches of that vile wretch--is there any
comparison between the two? Better a thou<!-585-->sand times die at the
post of duty than marry Mercy Merrick.

<P>"As I have written the creature's name, I may add--so as to have all
the sooner done with the subject--that I shall look with anxiety for your
next letter. Do not suppose that I feel the smallest curiosity about this
degraded and designing woman. My interest in her is purely religious. To
persons of my devout turn of mind she is an awful warning. When I feel
Satan near me--it will be <I>such</I> a means of grace to think of Mercy
Merrick!

<P>"Poor Lady Janet! I noticed those signs of mental decay to which you
so feelingly allude at the last interview I had with her in Mablethorpe
House. If you can find an opportunity, will you say that I wish her well,
here and hereafter? and will you please add that I do not omit to remember
her in my prayers?

<P>"There is just a chance of my visiting England toward the close of the
autumn. My fortunes have changed since I wrote last. I have been received
as reader and companion by a lady who is the wife of one of our high judicial
functionaries in this part of the world. I do not take much interest in
<I>him</I>; he is what they call a 'self-made man.' His wife is charming.
Besides being a person of highly intellectual tastes, she is greatly her
husband's superior--as you will understand when I tell you that she is
related to the Gommerys of Pommery; <I>not</I> the Pommerys of Gommery,
who (as your knowledge of our old families will inform you) only&nbsp;<!--586-->claim
kindred with the younger branch of that ancient race.

<P>"In the elegant and improving companionship which I now enjoy I should
feel quite happy but for one drawback. The climate of Canada is not favorable
to my kind patroness, and her medical advisers recommend her to winter
in London. In this event, I am to have the privilege of accompanying her.
Is it necessary to add that my first visit will be paid at your house?
I feel already united by sympathy to your mother and your sisters. There
is a sort of freemasonry among gentlewomen, is there not? With best thanks
and remembrances, and many delightful anticipations of your next letter,
believe me, dear Mr. Holmcroft,

<P>"Truly yours, GRACE ROSEBERRY."
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>III.</CENTER>


<P><I>From</I> MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT <I>to</I> MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY.

<P>"MY DEAR MISS ROSEBERRY--Pray excuse my long silence. I have waited
for mail after mail, in the hope of being able to send you some good news
at last. It is useless to wait longer. My worst forebodings have been realized:
my painful duty compels me to write a letter which will surprise and shock
you.

<P>"Let me describe events in their order as they happened. In this way
I may hope to gradually prepare your mind for what is to come.

<P>"About three weeks after I wrote to you last, Julian Gray paid the penalty
of his headlong&nbsp;<!--587-->rashness. I do not mean that he suffered
any actual violence at the hands of the people among whom he had cast his
lot. On the contrary, he succeeded, incredible as it may appear, in producing
a favorable impression on the ruffians about him. As I understand it, they
began by respecting his courage in venturing among them alone; and they
ended in discovering that he was really interested in promoting their welfare.
It is to the other peril, indicated in my last letter, that he has fallen
a victim--the peril of disease. Not long after he began his labors in the
district fever broke out. We only heard that Julian had been struck down
by the epidemic when it was too late to remove him from the lodging that
he occupied in the neighborhood. I made inquiries personally the moment
the news reached us. The doctor in attendance refused to answer for his
life.

<P>"In this alarming state of things poor Lady Janet, impulsive and unreasonable
as usual, insisted on leaving Mablethorpe House and taking up her residence
near her nephew.

<P>"Finding it impossible to persuade her of the folly of removing from
home and its comforts at her age, I felt it my duty to accompany her. We
found accommodation (such as it was) in a river-side inn, used by ship-captains
and commercial travelers. I took it on myself to provide the best medical
assistance, Lady Janet's insane prejudices against doctors impelling her
to leave this important part of the arrangements entirely in my hands.

<P><!--588-->"It is needless to weary you by entering into details on the
subject of Julian's illness.

<P>"The fever pursued the ordinary course, and was characterized by the
usual intervals of delirium and exhaustion succeeding each other. Subsequent
events, which it is, unfortunately, necessary to relate to you, leave me
no choice but to dwell (as briefly as possible) on the painful subject
of the delirium. In other cases the wanderings of fever-stricken people
present, I am told, a certain variety of range. In Julian's case they were
limited to one topic. He talked incessantly of Mercy Merrick. His invariable
petition to his medical attendants entreated them to send for her to nurse
him. Day and night that one idea was in his mind, and that one name on
his lips.

<P>"The doctors naturally made inquiries as to this absent person. I was
obliged (in confidence) to state the circumstances to them plainly.

<P>"The eminent physician whom I had called in to superintend the treatment
behaved admirably. Though he has risen from the lower order of the people,
he has, strange to say, the instincts of a gentleman. He thoroughly understood
our trying position, and felt all the importance of preventing such a person
as Mercy Merrick from seizing the opportunity of intruding herself at the
bedside. A soothing prescription (I have his own authority for saying it)
was all that was required to meet the patient's case. The local doctor,
on the other hand, a young man (and evidently a red-hot radical), proved
to be&nbsp;<!--589-->obstinate, and, considering his position, insolent
as well. 'I have nothing to do with the lady's character, and with your
opinion of it,' he said to me. 'I have only, to the best of my judgment,
to point out to you the likeliest means of saving the patient's life. Our
art is at the end of its resources. Send for Mercy Merrick, no matter who
she is or what she is. There is just a chance--especially if she proves
to be a sensible person and a good nurse--that he may astonish you all
by recognizing her. In that case only, his recovery is probable. If you
persist in disregarding his entreaties, if you let the delirium go on for
four-and-twenty hours more, he is a dead man.'

<P>"Lady Janet was, most unluckily, present when this impudent opinion
was delivered at the bedside.

<P>"Need I tell you the sequel? Called upon to choose between the course
indicated by a physician who is making his five thousand a year, and who
is certain of the next medical baronetcy, and the advice volunteered by
an obscure general practitioner at the East End of London, who is not making
his five hundred a year--need I stop to inform you of her ladyship's decision?
You know her; and you will only too well understand that her next proceeding
was to pay a third visit to the Refuge.

<P>"Two hours later--I give you my word of honor I am not exaggerating--Mercy
Merrick was established at Julian's bedside.

<P>"The excuse, of course, was that it was her duty not to let any private
scruples of her own&nbsp;<!--590-->stand in the way, when a medical authority
had declared that she might save the patient's life. You will not be surprised
to hear that I withdrew from the scene. The physician followed my example--after
having written his soothing prescription, and having been grossly insulted
by the local practitioner's refusing to make use of it. I went back in
the doctor's carriage. He spoke most feelingly and properly. Without giving
any positive opinion, I could see that he had abandoned all hope of Julian's
recovery. 'We are in the hands of Providence, Mr. Holmcroft;' those were
his last words as he set me down at my mother's door.

<P>"I have hardly the heart to go on. If I studied my own wishes, I should
feel inclined to stop here.

<P>"Let me, at least, hasten to the end. In two or three days' time I received
my first intelligence of the patient and his nurse. Lady Janet informed
me that he had recognized her. When I heard this I felt prepared for what
was to come. The next report announced that he was gaining strength, and
the next that he was out of danger. Upon this Lady Janet returned to Mablethorpe
House. I called there a week ago--and heard that he had been removed to
the sea-side. I called yesterday--and received the latest information from
her ladyship's own lips. My pen almost refuses to write it. Mercy Merrick
has consented to marry him!

<P>"An outrage on Society--that is how my mother and my sisters view it;
that is how <I>you</I> will view it too. My mother has herself&nbsp;<!--591->struck Julian's name off her invitation-list.  The servants have their orders, if he presumes to call: 'Not at home.'



<P>"I am unhappily only too certain that I am correct in writing to you of this disgraceful marriage as of a settled thing.  Lady Janet went the length of showing me the letters--one from Julian, the other from the woman herself.  Fancy Mercy Merrick in correspondence with Lady Janet Roy! addressing her as 'My dear Lady Janet,' and signing, 'Yours affectionately!'



<P>"I had not the patience to read either of the letters through.  Julian's tone is the tone of a Socialist; in my opinion his bishop ought to be informed of it.  As for <I>her</I> she plays her part just as cleverly with her pen as she played it with her tongue.  'I cannot disguise from myself that I am wrong in yielding.  .  .  .  Sad forebodings fill my mind when I think of the future.  .  .  .  I feel as if the first contemptuous look that is cast at my husband will destroy <I>my</I> happiness, though it may not disturb <I>him</I>.  .  .  .  As long as I was parted from him I could control my own weakness, I could accept my hard lot.  But how can I resist him after having watched for weeks at his bedside; after having seen his first smile, and heard his first grateful words to me while I was slowly helping him back to life?'



<P>"There is the tone which she takes through four closely written pages of nauseous humility and clap-trap sentiment!  It is enough to make one despise women.  Thank God, there is the contrast at hand to remind me of what is due to <!--592-->the
better few among the sex. I feel that my mother and my sisters are doubly
precious to me now. May I add, on the side of consolation, that I prize
with hardly inferior gratitude the privilege of corresponding with <I>you?</I>

<P>"Farewell for the present. I am too rudely shaken in my most cherished
convictions, I am too depressed and disheartened, to write more. All good
wishes go with you, dear Miss Roseberry, until we meet.

<P>"Most truly yours, HORACE HOLMCROFT."

<CENTER>IV.</CENTER>


<P><I>Extracts from the</I> DIARY <I>of</I> THE REVEREND JULIAN GRAY.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>FIRST EXTRACT.</CENTER>


<P>. . . ."A month to-day since we were married! I have only one thing
to say: I would cheerfully go through all that I have suffered to live
this one month over again. I never knew what happiness was until now. And
better still, I have persuaded Mercy that it is all her doing. I have scattered
her misgivings to the winds; she is obliged to submit to evidence, and
to own that she can make the happiness of my life.

<P>"We go back to London to-morrow. She regrets leaving the tranquil retirement
of this remote sea-side place--she dreads change. I care nothing for it.
It is all one to me where I go, so long as my wife is with me."
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>SECOND EXTRACT.</CENTER>


<P>"The first cloud has risen. I entered the room unexpectedly just now,
and found her in tears.

<P><!--593-->"With considerable difficulty I persuaded her to tell me what
had happened. Are there any limits to the mischief that can be done by
the tongue of a foolish woman? The landlady at my lodgings is the woman,
in this case. Having no decided plans for the future as yet, we returned
(most unfortunately, as the event has proved) to the rooms in London which
I inhabited in my bachelor days. They are still mine for six weeks to come,
and Mercy was unwilling to let me incur the expense of taking her to a
hotel. At breakfast this morning I rashly congratulated myself (in my wife's
hearing) on finding that a much smaller collection than usual of letters
and cards had accumulated in my absence. Breakfast over, I was obliged
to go out. Painfully sensitive, poor thing, to any change in my experience
of the little world around me which it is possible to connect with the
event of my marriage, Mercy questioned the landlady, in my absence, about
the diminished number of my visitors and my correspondents. The woman seized
the opportunity of gossiping about me and my affairs, and my wife's quick
perception drew the right conclusion unerringly. My marriage has decided
certain wise heads of families on discontinuing their social relations
with me. The facts, unfortunately, speak for themselves. People who in
former years habitually called upon me and invited me--or who, in the event
of my absence, habitually wrote to me at this season--have abstained with
a remarkable unanimity from calling, inviting, or writing now.

<P><!--594-->"It would have been sheer waste of time--to say nothing of
its also implying a want of confidence in my wife--if I had attempted to
set things right by disputing Mercy's conclusion. I could only satisfy
her that not so much as the shadow of disappointment or mortification rested
on my mind. In this way I have, to some extent, succeeded in composing
my poor darling. But the wound has been inflicted, and the wound is felt.
There is no disguising that result. I must face it boldly.

<P>"Trifling as this incident is in my estimation, it has decided me on
one point already. In shaping my future course I am now resolved to act
on my own convictions--in preference to taking the well-meant advice of
such friends as are still left to me.

<P>"All my little success in life has been gained in the pulpit. I am what
is termed a popular preacher--but I have never, in my secret self, felt
any exultation in my own notoriety, or any extraordinary respect for the
means by which it has been won. In the first place, I have a very low idea
of the importance of oratory as an intellectual accomplishment. There is
no other art in which the conditions of success are so easy of attainment;
there is no other art in the practice of which so much that is purely superficial
passes itself off habitually for something that claims to be profound.
Then, again, how poor it is in the results which it achieves! Take my own
case. How often (for example) have I thundered with all my heart and soul
against the wicked extrava<!--595-->gance of dress among women--against
their filthy false hair and their nauseous powders and paints! How often
(to take another example) have I denounced the mercenary and material spirit
of the age--the habitual corruptions and dishonesties of commerce, in high
places and in low! What good have I done? I have delighted the very people
whom it was my object to rebuke. 'What a charming sermon!' 'More eloquent
than ever!' 'I used to dread the sermon at the other church--do you know,
I quite look forward to it now.' That is the effect I produce on Sunday.
On Monday the women are off to the milliners to spend more money than ever;
the city men are off to business to make more money than ever--while my
grocer, loud in my praises in his Sunday coat, turns up his week-day sleeves
and adulterates his favorite preacher's sugar as cheerfully as usual!

<P>"I have often, in past years, felt the objections to pursuing my career
which are here indicated. They were bitterly present to my mind when I
resigned my curacy, and they strongly influence me now.

<P>"I am weary of my cheaply won success in the pulpit. I am weary of society
as I find it in my time. I felt some respect for myself, and some heart
and hope in my works among the miserable wretches in Green Anchor Fields.
But I can not, and must not, return among them: I have no right, <I>now</I>,
to trifle with my health and my life. I must go back to my preaching, or
I must leave England. Among a primitive people, away&nbsp;<!--596-->from
the cities--in the far and fertile West of the great American continent--I
might live happily with my wife, and do good among my neighbors, secure
of providing for our wants out of the modest little income which is almost
useless to me here. In the life which I thus picture to myself I see love,
peace, health, and duties and occupations that are worthy of a Christian
man. What prospect is before me if I take the advice of my friends and
stay here? Work of which I am weary, because I have long since ceased to
respect it; petty malice that strikes at me through my wife, and mortifies
and humiliates her, turn where she may. If I had only myself to think of,
I might defy the worst that malice can do. But I have Mercy to think of--Mercy,
whom I love better than my own life! Women live, poor things, in the opinions
of others. I have had one warning already of what my wife is likely to
suffer at the hands of my 'friends'--Heaven forgive me for misusing the
word! Shall I deliberately expose her to fresh mortifications?--and this
for the sake of returning to a career the rewards of which I no longer
prize? No! We will both be happy--we will both be free! God is merciful,
Nature is kind, Love is true, in the New World as well as the Old. To the
New World we will go!"

<P>"I hardly know whether I have done right or wrong. I mentioned yesterday
to Lady Janet the cold reception of me on my return to London, and the
painful sense of it felt by my wife.

<P><!--597-->"My aunt looks at the matter from her own peculiar point of
view, and makes light of it accordingly. 'You never did, and never will,
understand Society, Julian,' said her ladyship. 'These poor stupid people
simply don't know what to do. They are waiting to be told by a person of
distinction whether they are, or are not, to recognize your marriage. In
plain English, they are waiting to be led by Me. Consider it done. I will
lead them.'

<P>"I thought my aunt was joking. The event of to-day has shown me that
she is terribly in earnest. Lady Janet has issued invitations for one of
her grand balls at Mablethorpe House; and she has caused the report to
be circulated everywhere that the object of the festival is 'to celebrate
the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Julian Gray!'

<P>"I at first refused to be present. To my amazement, however, Mercy sides
with my aunt. She reminds me of all that we both owe to Lady Janet; and
she has persuaded me to alter my mind. We are to go to the ball--at my
wife express request!

<P>"The meaning of this, as I interpret it, is that my poor love is still
pursued in secret by the dread that my marriage has injured me in the general
estimation. She will suffer anything, risk anything, believe anything,
to be freed from that one haunting doubt. Lady Janet predicts a social
triumph; and my wife's despair--not my wife's conviction--accepts the prophecy.
As for me, I am prepared for the&nbsp;<!--598-->result. It will end in
our going to the New World, and trying Society in its infancy, among the
forests and the plains. I shall quietly prepare for our departure, and
own what I have done at the right time--that is to say, when the ball is
over."

<P>"I have met with the man for my purpose--an old college friend of mine,
now partner in a firm of ship-owners, largely concerned in emigration.

<P>"One of their vessels sails for America, from the port of London, in
a fortnight, touching at Plymouth. By a fortunate coincidence, Lady Janet's
ball takes place in a fortnight. I see my way.

<P>"Helped by the kindness of my friend, I have arranged to have a cabin
kept in reserve, on payment of a small deposit. If the ball ends (as I
believe it will) in new mortifications for Mercy--do what they may, I defy
them to mortify <I>me</I>--I have only to say the word by telegraph, and
we shall catch the ship at Plymouth.

<P>"I know the effect it will have when I break the news to her, but I
am prepared with my remedy. The pages of my diary, written in past years,
will show plainly enough that it is not <I>she</I> who is driving me away
from England. She will see the longing in me for other work and other scenes
expressing itself over and over again long before the time when we first
met."

<P>"Mercy's ball dress--a present from kind Lady Janet--is finished. I
was allowed to see the first trial, or preliminary rehearsal, of this work
of art. I don't in the least understand the merits of silk and lace; but
one thing I know--my wife will be the most beautiful woman at the ball.

<P>"The same day I called on Lady Janet to thank her, and encountered a
new revelation of the wayward and original character of my dear old aunt.

<P>"She was on the point of tearing up a letter when I went into her room.
Seeing me, she suspended her purpose and handed me the letter. It was in
Mercy's handwriting. Lady Janet pointed to a passage on the last page.
'Tell your wife, with my love,' she said, 'that I am the most obstinate
woman of the two. I positively refuse to read her, as I positively refuse
to listen to her, whenever she attempts to return to that one subject.
Now give me the letter back.' I gave it back, and saw it torn up before
my face. The 'one subject' prohibited to Mercy as sternly as ever is still
the subject of the personation of Grace Roseberry! Nothing could have been
more naturally introduced, or more delicately managed, than my wife's brief
reference to the subject. No matter. The reading of the first line was
enough. Lady Janet shut her eyes and destroyed the letter--Lady Janet is
determined to live and die absolutely ignorant of the true story of 'Mercy
Merrick.'&nbsp;<!--600-->What unanswerable riddles we are! Is it wonderful
if we perpetually fail to understand one another?"

<P>"The morning after the ball.

<P>"It is done and over. Society has beaten Lady Janet. I have neither
patience nor time to write at length of it. We leave for Plymouth by the
afternoon express.

<P>"We were rather late in arriving at the ball. The magnificent rooms
were filling fast. Walking through them with my wife, she drew my attention
to a circumstance which I had not noticed at the time. 'Julian,' she said,
'look round among the ladies, and tell me if you see anything strange.'
As I looked round the band began playing a waltz. I observed that a few
people only passed by us to the dancing-room. I noticed next that of those
few fewer still were young. At last it burst upon me. With certain exceptions
(so rare as to prove the rule), there were no young girls at Lady Janet's
ball. I took Mercy at once back to the reception-room. Lady Janet's face
showed that she, too, was aware of what had happened. The guests were still
arriving. We received the men and their wives, the men and their mothers,
the men and their grandmothers--but, in place of their unmarried daughters,
elaborate excuses, offered with a shameless politeness wonderful to see.
Yes! This was how the matrons in high life had got over the difficulty
of meeting Mrs. Julian Gray at Lady Janet's house.

<P><!--601->"Let me do strict justice to every one.  The ladies who <I>were</I> present showed the needful respect for their hostess.  They did their duty--no, overdid it, is perhaps the better phrase.



<P>"I really had no adequate idea of the coarseness and rudeness which have filtered their way through society in these later times until I saw the reception accorded to my wife.  The days of prudery and prejudice are days gone by.  Excessive amiability and excessive liberality are the two favorite assumptions of the modern generation.  To see the women expressing their liberal forgetfulness of my wifely misfortunes, and the men their amiable anxiety to encourage her husband; to hear the same set phrases repeated in every room--'So charmed to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Gray; so <I>much</I> obliged to dear Lady Janet for giving us this opportunity!--Julian, old man, what a beautiful creature!  I envy you; upon my honor, I envy you!'--to receive this sort of welcome, emphasized by obtrusive hand-shakings, sometimes actually by downright kissings of my wife, and then to look round and see that not one in thirty of these very people had brought their unmarried daughters to the ball, was, I honestly believe, to see civilized human nature in its basest conceivable aspect.  The New World may have its disappointments in store for us, but it cannot possibly show us any spectacle so abject as the spectacle which we witnessed last night at my aunt's ball.



<P>"Lady Janet marked her sense of the proceeding adopted by her guests by leaving them <!--602-->to
themselves. Her guests remained and supped heartily notwithstanding. They
all knew by experience that there were no stale dishes and no cheap wines
at Mablethorpe House. They drank to the end of the bottle, and they ate
to the last truffle in the dish.

<P>"Mercy and I had an interview with my aunt upstairs before we left.
I felt it necessary to state plainly my resolution to leave England. The
scene that followed was so painful that I cannot prevail on myself to return
to it in these pages. My wife is reconciled to our departure; and Lady
Janet accompanies us as far as Plymouth--these are the results. No words
can express my sense of relief, now that it is all settled. The one sorrow
I shall carry away with me from the shores of England will be the sorrow
of parting with dear, warm-hearted Lady Janet. At her age it is a parting
for life.

<P>"So closes my connection with my own country. While I have Mercy by
my side I face the unknown future, certain of carrying my happiness with
me, go where I may. We shall find five hundred adventurers like ourselves
when we join the emigrant ship, for whom their native land has no occupation
and no home. Gentlemen of the Statistical Department, add two more to the
number of social failures produced by England in the year of our Lord eighteen
hundred and seventy-one--Julian Gray and Mercy Merrick.
