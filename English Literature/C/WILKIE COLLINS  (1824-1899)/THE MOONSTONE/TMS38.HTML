CHAPTER II</H1></CENTER>
`B<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTEREDGE</FONT>!' I said, pointing to the well-remembered
book on his knee, `has <I>Robinson Crusoe</I> informed you, this evening,
that you might expect to see Franklin Blake?'

<P>`By the lord Harry, Mr. Franklin!' cried the old man, `that's exactly
what <I>Robinson Crusoe</I> has done!'

<P>He struggled to his feet with my assistance, and stood for a moment,
looking backwards and forwards between <I>Robinson Crusoe</I> and me, apparently
at a loss to discover which of us had surprised him most. The verdict ended
in favour of the book. Holding it open before him in both hands, he surveyed
the wonderful volume with a stare of unutterable anticipation--as if he
expected to see Robinson Crusoe himself walk out of the pages, and favour
us with a personal interview.

<P>`Here's the bit, Mr. Franklin!' he said, as soon as he had recovered
the use of his speech. `As I live by bread, sir, here's the bit I was reading,
the moment before you came in! Page one hundred and fifty-six as follows:--"I
stood like one Thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an Apparition." If that
isn't as much as to say: "Expect the sudden appearance of Mr. Franklin
Blake"--there's no meaning in the English language!' said Betteredge, closing
the book with a bang, and getting one of his hands free at last to take
the hand which I offered him.

<P>I had expected him, naturally enough under the circumstances, to overwhelm
me with questions. But no--the hospitable impulse was the uppermost impulse
in the old servant's mind, when a member of the family appeared (no matter
how!) as a visitor at the house.

<P>`Walk in, Mr. Franklin,' he said, opening the door behind him, with
his quaint old-fashioned bow. `I'll ask what brings you here afterwards--I
must make you comfortable first. There have been sad changes, since you
went away. The house is shut up, and the servants are gone. Never mind
that! I'll cook your dinner; and the gardener's wife will make your bed--and
if there's a bottle of our famous Latour claret left in the cellar, down
your throat, Mr. Franklin, that bottle shall go. I bid you welcome, sir!
I bid you heartily welcome!' said the poor old fellow, fighting manfully
against the gloom of the deserted house, and receiving me with the sociable
and courteous attention of the bygone time.

<P>It vexed me to disappoint him. But the house was Rachel's house, now.
Could I eat in it, or sleep in it, after what had happened in London? The
commonest sense of self-respect forbade me--properly forbade me--to cross
the threshold.

<P>I took Betteredge by the arm, and led him out into the garden. There
was no help for it. I was obliged to tell him the truth. Between his attachment
to Rachel, and his attachment to me, he was sorely puzzled and distressed
at the turn things had taken. His opinion, when he expressed it, was given
in his usual downright manner, and was agreeably redolent of the most positive
philosophy I know--the philosophy of the Betteredge school.

<P>`Miss Rachel has her faults--I've never denied it,' he began. `And riding
the high horse, now and then, is one of them. She has been trying to ride
over <I>you</I>--and you have put up with it. Lord, Mr. Franklin, don't
you know women by this time better than that? You have heard me talk of
the late Mrs. Betteredge?'

<P>I had heard him talk of the late Mrs. Betteredge pretty often--invariably
producing her as his one undeniable example of the inbred frailty and perversity
of the other sex. In that capacity he exhibited her now.

<P>`Very well, Mr. Franklin. Now listen to me. Different women have different
ways of riding the high horse. The late Mrs. Betteredge took her exercise
on that favourite female animal whenever I happened to deny her anything
that she had set her heart on. So sure as I came home from my work on these
occasions, so sure was my wife to call to me up the kitchen stairs, and
to say that, after my brutal treatment of her, she hadn't the heart to
cook me my dinner. I put up with it for some time--just as you are putting
up with it now from Miss Rachel. At last my patience wore out. I went downstairs,
and I took Mrs. Betteredge--affectionately, you understand--up in my arms,
and carried her, holus-bolus, into the best parlour, where she received
her company. I said, "That's the right place for you, my dear," and so
went back to the kitchen. I locked myself in, and took off my coat, and
turned up my shirt-sleeves, and cooked my own dinner. When it was done,
I served it up in my best manner, and enjoyed it most heartily. I had my
pipe and my drop of grog afterwards; and then I cleared the table, and
washed the crockery, and cleaned the knives and forks, and put the things
away, and swept up the hearth. When things were as bright and clean again
as bright and clean could be, I opened the door and let Mrs. Betteredge
in. "I've had my dinner, my dear," I said; "and I hope you will find that
I have left the kitchen all that your fondest wishes can desire." For the
rest of that woman's life, Mr. Franklin, I never had to cook my dinner
again! Moral: You have put up with Miss Rachel in London; don't put up
with her in Yorkshire. Come back to the house.'

<P>Quite unanswerable! I could only assure my good friend that even <I>his</I>
powers of persuasion were, in this case, thrown away on me.

<P>`It's lovely evening,' I said. `I shall walk to Frizinghall, and stay
at the hotel, and you must come to-morrow morning and breakfast with me.
I have something to say to you.'

<P>Betteredge shook his head gravely.

<P>`I am heartily sorry for this,' he said. `I had hoped, Mr. Franklin,
to hear that things were all smooth and pleasant again between you and
Miss Rachel. If you must have your own way, sir,' he continued, after a
moment's reflection, `there is no need to go to Frizinghall to-night for
a bed. It's to be had nearer than that. There's Hotherstone's Farm, barely
two miles from here. You can hardly object to <I>that</I> on Miss Rachel's
account,' the old man added slily. `Hotherstone lives, Mr. Franklin, on
his own freehold.'

<P>I remembered the place the moment Betteredge mentioned it. The farm-house
stood in a sheltered inland valley, on the banks of the prettiest stream
in that part of Yorkshire: and the farmer had a spare bedroom and parlour,
which he was accustomed to let to artists, anglers, and tourists in general.
A more agreeable place of abode, during my stay in the neighbourhood, I
could not have wished to find.

<P>`Are the rooms to let?' I inquired.

<P>`Mrs. Hotherstone herself, sir, asked for my good word to recommend
the rooms, yesterday.'

<P>`I'll take them, Betteredge, with the greatest pleasure.'

<P>We went back to the yard, in which I had left my travelling-bag. After
putting a stick through the handle, and swinging the bag over his shoulder,
Betteredge appeared to relapse into the bewilderment which my sudden appearance
had caused, when I surprised him in the beehive chair. He looked incredulously
at the house, and then he wheeled about, and looked more incredulously
still at me.

<P>`I've lived a goodish long time in the world,' said this best and dearest
of all old servants--`but the like of this, I never did expect to see.
There stands the house, and here stands Mr. Franklin Blake--and, Damme,
if one of them isn't turning his back on the other, and going to sleep
in a lodging!'

<P>He led the way out, wagging his head and growling ominously. `There's
only one more miracle that <I>can</I> happen,' he said to me, over his
shoulder. `The next thing you'll do, Mr. Franklin, will be to pay me back
that seven and sixpence you borrowed of me when you were a boy.'

<P>This stroke of sarcasm put him in a better humour with himself and with
me. We left the house, and passed through the lodge gates. Once clear of
the grounds, the duties of hospitality (in Betteredge's code of morals)
ceased, and the privileges of curiosity began.

<P>He dropped back, so as to let me get on a level with him. `Fine evening
for a walk, Mr. Franklin,' he said, as if we had just accidentally encountered
each other at that moment. `Supposing you had gone to the hotel at Frizinghall,
sir?'

<P>`Yes?'

<P>`I should have had the honour of breakfasting with you, tomorrow morning.'

<P>`Come and breakfast with me at Hotherstone's Farm, instead.'

<P>`Much obliged to you for your kindness, Mr. Franklin. But it wasn't
exactly breakfast that I was driving at. I think you mentioned that you
had something to say to me? If it's no secret, sir,' said Betteredge, suddenly
abandoning the crooked way, and taking the straight one, `I'm burning to
know what's brought you down here, if you please, in this sudden way.'

<P>`What brought me here before?' I asked.

<P>`The Moonstone, Mr. Franklin. But what brings you now, sir?'

<P>`The Moonstone again, Betteredge.'

<P>The old man suddenly stood still, and looked at me in the grey twilight
as if he suspected his own ears of deceiving him.

<P>`If that's a joke, sir,' he said, `I am afraid I'm getting a little
dull in my old age. I don't take it.'

<P>`It's no joke,' I answered. `I have come here to take up the inquiry
which was dropped when I left England. I have come here to do what nobody
has done yet--to find out who took the Diamond.'

<P>`Let the Diamond be, Mr. Franklin! Take my advice, and let the Diamond
be! That cursed Indian jewel has misguided everybody who has come near
it. Don't waste your money and your temper--in the fine spring-time of
your life, sir--by meddling with the Moonstone. How can <I>you</I> hope
to succeed (saving your presence), when Sergeant Cuff himself made a mess
of it? Sergeant Cuff!' repeated Betteredge, shaking his forefinger at me
sternly. `The greatest policeman in England!'

<P>`My mind is made up, my old friend. Even Sergeant Cuff doesn't daunt
me. By the by, I may want to speak to him, sooner or later. Have you heard
anything of him lately?'

<P>`The Sergeant won't help you, Mr. Franklin.'

<P>`Why not?'

<P>`There has been an event, sir, in the police circles, since you went
away. The great Cuff has retired from business. He has got a little cottage
at Dorking; and he's up to his eyes in the growing of roses. I have it
in his own handwriting, Mr. Franklin. He has grown the white moss rose,
without budding it on the dog-rose first. And Mr. Begbie the gardener is
to go to Dorking, and own that the Sergeant has beaten him at last.'

<P>`It doesn't much matter,' I said. `I must do without Sergeant Cuff's
help. And I must trust to you, at starting.'

<P>It is likely enough that I spoke rather carelessly. At any rate, Betteredge
seemed to be piqued by something in the reply which I had just made to
him. `You might trust to worse than me, Mr. Franklin--I can tell you that,'
he said, a little sharply.

<P>The tone in which he retorted, and a certain disturbance, after he had
spoken, which I detected in his manner, suggested to me that he was possessed
of some information which he hesitated to communicate.

<P>`I expect you to help me,' I said, `in picking up the fragments of evidence
which Sergeant Cuff has left behind him. I know you can do that. Can you
do no more?'

<P>`What more can you expect from me, sir?' asked Betteredge, with an appearance
of the utmost humility.

<P>`I expect more--from what you said just now.'

<P>`Mere boasting, Mr. Franklin,' returned the old man obstinately. `Some
people are born boasters, and they never get over it to their dying day.
I'm one of them.'

<P>There was only one way to take with him. I appealed to his interest
in Rachel, and his interest in me.

<P>`Betteredge, would you be glad to hear that Rachel and I were good friends
again?'

<P>`I have served your family, sir, to mighty little purpose, if you doubt
it!'

<P>`Do you remember how Rachel treated me, before I left England?'

<P>`As well as if it was yesterday! My lady herself wrote you a letter
about it; and you were so good as to show the letter to me. It said that
Miss Rachel was mortally offended with you, for the part you had taken
in trying to recover her jewel. And neither my lady, nor you, nor anybody
else could guess why.'

<P>`Quite true, Betteredge! And I come back from my travels, and find here
mortally offended with me still. I knew that the Diamond was at the bottom
of it, last year, and I know that the Diamond is at the bottom of it now.
I have tried to speak to her, and she won't see me. I have tried to write
to her, and she won't answer me. How, in Heaven's name, am I to clear the
matter up? The chance of searching into the loss of the Moonstone, is the
one chance of inquiry that Rachel herself has left me.'

<P>Those words evidently put the case before him, as he had not seen it
yet. He asked a question which satisfied me that I had shaken him.

<P>`There is no ill-feeling in this, Mr. Franklin, on your side--is there?'

<P>`There was some anger,' I answered, `when I left London. But that is
all worn out now. I want to make Rachel come to an understanding with me--and
I want nothing more.'

<P>`You don't feel any fear, sir--supposing you make any discoveries--in
regard to what you may find out about Miss Rachel?'

<P>I understood the jealous belief in his young mistress which prompted
those words.

<P>`I am as certain of her as you are,' I answered. `The fullest disclosure
of her secret will reveal nothing that can alter her place in your estimation,
or in mine.'

<P>Betteredge's last-left scruples vanished at that.

<P>`If I am doing wrong to help you, Mr. Franklin,' he exclaimed, `all
I can say is--I am as innocent of seeing it as the babe unborn! I can put
you on the road to discovery, if you can only go on by yourself. You remember
that poor girl of ours--Rosanna Spearman?'

<P>`Of course!'

<P>`You always thought she had some sort of confession, in regard to this
matter of the Moonstone, which she wanted to make to you?'

<P>`I certainly couldn't account for her strange conduct in any other way.'

<P>`You may set that doubt at rest, Mr. Franklin, whenever you please.'

<P>It was my turn to come to a standstill now. I tried vainly, in the gathering
darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, I asked a little
impatiently what he meant.

<P>`Steady, sir!' proceeded Betteredge. `I mean what I say. Rosanna Spearman
left a sealed letter behind her--a letter addressed to <I>you</I>.'

<P>`Where is it?'

<P>`In the possession of a friend of hers, at Cobb's Hole. You must have
heard tell, when you were here last, sir, of Limping Lucy--a lame girl
with a crutch.'

<P>`The fisherman's daughter?'

<P>`The same, Mr. Franklin.'

<P>`Why wasn't the letter forwarded to me?'

<P>`Limping Lucy has a will of her own, sir. She wouldn't give it into
any hands but yours. And you had left England before I could write to you.'

<P>`Let's go back, Betteredge, and get it at once!'

<P>`Too late, sir, to-night. They're great savers of candles along our
coast; and they go to bed early at Cobb's Hole.'

<P>`Nonsense! We might get there in half an hour.'

<P>`<I>You</I> might, sir. And when you did get there, you would find the
door locked.' He pointed to a light, glimmering below us; and, at the same
moment, I heard through the stillness of the evening the bubbling of a
stream. `There's the Farm, Mr. Franklin! Make yourself comfortable for
to-night, and come to me to-morrow morning--if you'll be so kind?'

<P>`You will go with me to the fisherman's cottage?'

<P>`Yes, sir.'

<P>`Early?'

<P>`As early, Mr. Franklin, as you like.'

<P>We descended the path that led to the Farm.
