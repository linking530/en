CHAPTER VI</H1></CENTER>
(1) `M<FONT SIZE=-1>ISS</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>LACK</FONT> presents here
compliments to Mr. Franklin Blake; and, in sending him the fifth chapter
of her humble narrative, begs to say that she feels quite unequal to enlarge
as she could wish on an event so awful, under the circumstances, as Lady
Verinder's death. She has, therefore, attached to her own manuscript, copious
Extracts from precious publications in her possession, all bearing on this
terrible subject. And may those Extracts (Miss Clack fervently hopes) sound
as the blast of a trumpet in the ears of her respected kinsman, Mr. Franklin
Blake.'

<P>(2) `Mr. Franklin Blake presents his compliments to Miss Clack, and
begs to thank her for the fifth chapter of her narrative. In returning
the extracts sent with it, he will refrain from mentioning any personal
objection which he may entertain to this species of literature, and will
merely say that the proposed additions to the manuscript are not necessary
to the fulfilment of the purpose that he has in view.'

<P>(3) `Miss Clack begs to acknowledge the return of her Extracts. She
affectionately reminds Mr. Franklin Blake that she is a Christian, and
that it is, therefore, quite impossible for him to offend her. Miss C.
persists in feeling the deepest interest in Mr. Blake, and pledges herself,
on the first occasion when sickness may lay him low, to offer him the use
of her Extracts for the second time. In the meanwhile she would be glad
to know, before beginning the final chapters of her narrative, whether
she may be permitted to make her humble contribution complete, by availing
herself of the light which later discoveries have thrown on the mystery
of the Moonstone.'

<P>(4) `Mr. Franklin Blake is sorry to disappoint Miss Clack. He can only
repeat the instructions which he had the honour of giving her when she
began her narrative. She is requested to limit herself to her own individual
experience of persons and events, as recorded in her diary. Later discoveries
she will be good enough to leave to the pens of those persons who can write
in the capacity of actual witnesses.'

<P>(5) `Miss Clack is extremely sorry to trouble Mr. Franklin Blake with
another letter. Her Extracts have been returned, and the expression of
her matured views on the subject of the Moonstone has been forbidden. Miss
Clack is painfully conscious that she ought (in the worldly phrase) to
feel herself put down. But, no--Miss C. has learnt Perseverance in the
School of Adversity. Her object in writing is to know whether Mr. Blake
(who prohibits everything else) prohibits the appearance of the present
correspondence in Miss Clack's narrative? Some explanation of the position
in which Mr. Blake's interference has placed her as an authoress, seems
due on the ground of common justice. And Miss Clack, on her side, is most
anxious that her letters should be produced to speak for themselves.'

<P>(6) `Mr. Franklin Blake agrees to Miss Clack's proposal, on the understanding
that she will kindly consider this intimation of his consent as closing
the correspondence between them.'

<P>(7) `Miss Clack feels it an act of Christian duty (before the correspondence
closes) to inform Mr. Franklin Blake that his last letter--evidently intended
to offend her--has not succeeded in accomplishing the object of the writer.
She affectionately requests Mr. Blake to retire to the privacy of his own
room, and to consider with himself whether the training which can thus
elevate a poor weak woman above the reach of insult, be not worthy of greater
admiration than he is now disposed to feel for it. On being favoured with
an intimation to that effect, Miss C. solemnly pledges herself to send
back the complete series of her Extracts to Mr. Franklin Blake.'

<P>[To this letter no answer was received. Comment is needless.
