<CENTER>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>THE STATEMENT OF SERGEANT CUFF'S MAN</FONT>
(1849)</CENTER>


<P>O<FONT SIZE=-1>N</FONT> the twenty-seventh of June last, I received
instructions from Sergeant Cuff to follow three men; suspected of murder,
and described as Indians. They had been seen on the Tower Wharf that morning,
embarking on board the steamer bound for Rotterdam.

<P>I left London by a steamer belonging to another company, which sailed
on the morning of Thursday the twenty-eighth. Arriving at Rotterdam, I
succeeded in finding the commander of the Wednesday's steamer. He informed
me that the Indians had certainly been passengers on board his vessel --
but as far as Gravesend only. Off that place, one of the three had inquired
at what time they would reach Calais. On being informed that the steamer
was bound to Rotterdam, the spokesman of the party expressed the greatest
surprise and distress at the mistake which he and his two friends had made.
They were all willing (he said) to sacrifice their passage money, if the
commander of the steamer would only put them ashore. Commiserating their
position, as foreigners in a strange land, and knowing no reason for detaining
them, the commander signalled for a shore boat, and the three men left
the vessel.

<P>This proceeding of the Indians having been plainly resolved on beforehand,
as a means of preventing their being traced, I lost no time in returning
to England. I left the steamer at Gravesend, and discovered that the Indians
had gone from that place to London. Thence, I again traced them as having
left for Plymouth. Inquiries made at Plymouth proved that they had sailed,
forty-eight hours previously, in the <I>Bewley Castle</I>, East Indiaman,
bound direct to Bombay.

<P>On receiving this intelligence, Sergeant Cuff caused the authorities
at Bombay to be communicated with, overland -- so that the vessel might
be boarded by the police immediately on her entering the port. This step
having been taken, my connection with the matter came to an end. I have
heard nothing more of it since that time.

<CENTER>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>THE STATEMENT OF THE CAPTAIN</FONT> (1849)</CENTER>


<P>I'<FONT SIZE=-1>AM</FONT> requested by Sergeant Cuff to set in writing
certain facts, concerning three men (believed to be Hindoos) who were passengers,
last summer, in the ship <I>Bewley Castle</I>, bound for Bombay direct,
under my command.

<P>The Hindoos joined us at Plymouth. On the passage out I heard no complaint
of their conduct. They were berthed in the forward part of the vessel.
I had but few occasions myself of personally noticing them.

<P>In the latter part of the voyage, we had the misfortune to be becalmed
for three days and nights, off the coast of India. I have not got the ship's
journal to refer to, and I cannot now call to mind the latitude and longitude.
As to our position, therefore, I am only able to state generally that the
currents drifted us in towards the land, and that when the wind found us
again, we reached our port in twenty-four hours afterwards.

<P>The discipline of a ship (as all seafaring persons know) becomes relaxed
in a long calm. The discipline of my ship became relaxed. Certain gentlemen
among the passengers got some of the smaller boats lowered, and amused
themselves by rowing about, swimming, when the sun at evening time was
cool enough to let them divert themselves in that way. The boats when done
with ought to have been slung up again in their places. Instead of this
they were left moored to the ship's side. What with the heat, and what
with the vexation of the weather, neither officers nor men seemed to be
in heart for their duty while the calm lasted.

<P>On the third night, nothing unusual was heard or seen by the watch on
deck. When the morning came, the smallest of the boats was missing -- and
the three Hindoos were next reported to be missing too.

<P>If these men had stolen the boat shortly after dark (which I have no
doubt they did), we were near enough to the land to make it vain to send
in pursuit of them, when the discovery was made in the morning. I have
no doubt they got ashore, in that calm weather (making all due allowances
for fatigue and clumsy rowing), before daybreak.

<P>On reaching our port I there learnt, for the first time, the reason
these passengers had for seizing their opportunity of escaping from the
ship. I could only make the same statement to the authorities which I have
made here. They considered me to blame for allowing the discipline of the
vessel to be relaxed. I have expressed my regret on this score to them,
and to my owners. Since that time, nothing has been heard to my knowledge
of the three Hindoos. I have no more to add to what is here written.

<CENTER>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>THE STATEMENT OF MR. MURTHWAITE</FONT> (1850)</CENTER>

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;(<I>In a letter to</I> M<FONT SIZE=-1>R</FONT>. B<FONT SIZE=-1>RUFF</FONT>)</CENTER>


<P>H<FONT SIZE=-1>AVE</FONT> you any recollection, my dear sir, of a semi-savage
person whom you met out at dinner, in London, in the autumn of 'forty-eight?
Permit me to remind you that the person's name was Murthwaite, and that
you and he had a long conversation together after dinner. The talk related
to an Indian Diamond, called the Moonstone, and to a conspiracy then in
existence to get possession of the gem.

<P>Since that time, I have been wandering in Central Asia. Thence I have
drifted back to the scene of some of my past adventures in the north and
north-west of India. About a fortnight since, I found myself in a certain
district or province (but little known to Europeans) called Kattiawar.

<P>Here an adventure befell me, in which (incredible as it may appear)
you are personally interested.

<P>In the wild regions of Kattiawar (and how wild they are, you will understand,
when I tell you that even the husbandmen plough the land, armed to the
teeth), the population is fanatically devoted to the old Hindoo religion
-- to the ancient worship of Bramah and Vishnu. The few Mahometan families,
thinly scattered about the villages in the interior, are afraid to taste
meat of any kind. A Mahometan even suspected of killing that sacred animal,
the cow, is, as a matter of course, put to death without mercy in these
parts by the pious Hindoo neighbours who surround them. To strengthen the
religious enthusiasm of the people, two of the most famous shrines of Hindoo
pilgrimage are contained within the boundaries of Kattiawar. One of them
is Dwarka, the birthplace of the god Krishna. The other is the sacred city
of Somnauth -- sacked, and destroyed, as long since as the eleventh century,
by the Mahometan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni.

<P>Finding myself, for the second time, in these romantic regions, I resolved
not to leave Kattiawar, without looking once more on the magnificent desolation
of Somnauth. At the place where I planned to do this, I was (as nearly
as I could calculate it) some three days distant, journeying on foot, from
the sacred city.

<P>I had not been long on the road, before I noticed that other people
-- by twos and threes -- appeared to be travelling in the same direction
as myself.

<P>To such of these as spoke to me, I gave myself out as a Hindoo-Boodhist,
from a distant province, bound on a pilgrimage. It is needless to say that
my dress was of the sort to carry out this description. Add, that I know
the language as well as I know my own, and that I am lean enough and brown
enough to make it no easy matter to detect my European origin -- and you
will understand that I passed muster with the people readily: not as one
of themselves, but as a stranger from a distant part of their own country.

<P>On the second day, the number of Hindoos travelling in my direction
had increased to fifties and hundreds. On the third day, the throng had
swollen to thousands; all slowly converging to one point -- the city of
Somnauth.

<P>A trifling service which I was able to render to one of my fellow-pilgrims,
during the third day's journey, proved the means of introducing me to certain
Hindoos of the higher caste. From these men I learnt that the multitude
was on its way to a great religious ceremony, which was to take place on
a hill at a little distance from Somnauth. The ceremony was in honour of
the god of the Moon; and it was to be held at night.

<P>The crowd detained us as we drew near to the place of celebration. By
the time we reached the hill the moon was high in the heaven. My Hindoo
friends possessed some special privileges which enabled them to gain access
to the shrine. They kindly allowed me to accompany them. When we arrived
at the place, we found the shrine hidden from our view by a curtain hung
between two magnificent trees. Beneath the trees a flat projection of rock
jutted out, and formed a species of natural platform. Below this I stood,
in company with my Hindoo friends.

<P>Looking back down the hill, the view presented the grandest spectacle
of Nature and Man, in combination, that I have ever seen. The lower slopes
of the eminence melted imperceptibly into a grassy plain, the place of
the meeting of three rivers. On one side, the graceful winding of the waters
stretched away, now visible, now hidden by trees, as far as the eye could
see. On the other, the waveless ocean slept in the calm of the night. People
this lovely scene with tens of thousands of human creatures, all dressed
in white, stretching down the sides of the hill, overflowing into the plain,
and fringing the nearer banks of the winding rivers. Light this halt of
the pilgrims by the wild red flames of cressets and torches, streaming
up at intervals from every part of the innumerable throng. Imagine the
moonlight of the East, pouring in unclouded glory over all -- and you will
form some idea of the view that met me when I looked forth from the summit
of the hill.

<P>A strain of plaintive music, played on stringed instruments and flutes,
recalled my attention to the hidden shrine.

<P>I turned, and saw on the rocky platform the figures of three men. In
the central figure of the three I recognized the man to whom I had spoken
in England, when the Indians appeared on the terrace at Lady Verinder's
house. The other two who had been his companions on that occasion were
no doubt his companions also on this.

<P>One of the spectators, near whom I was standing, saw me start. In a
whisper, he explained to me the apparition of the three figures on the
platform of rock.

<P>They were Brahmins (he said) who had forfeited their caste in the service
of the god. The god had commanded that their purification should be the
purification by pilgrimage. On that night, the three men were to part.
In three separate directions, they were to set forth as pilgrims to the
shrines of India. Never more were they to look on each other's faces. Never
more were they to rest on their wanderings, from the day which witnessed
their separation, to the day which witnessed their death.

<P>As those words were whispered to me, the plaintive music ceased. The
three men prostrated themselves on the rock, before the curtain which hid
the shrine. They rose -- they looked on one another -- they embraced. Then
they descended separately among the people. The people made way for them
in dead silence. In three different directions I saw the crowd part, at
one and the same moment. Slowly the grand white mass of the people closed
together again. The track of the doomed men through the ranks of their
fellow-mortals was obliterated. We saw them no more.

<P>A new strain of music, loud and jubilant, rose from the hidden shrine.
The crowd around me shuddered, and pressed together.

<P>The curtain between the trees was drawn aside, and the shrine was disclosed
to view.

<P>There, raised high on a throne -- seated on his typical antelope, with
his four arms stretching towards the four corners of the earth -- there,
soared above us, dark and awful in the mystic light of heaven, the god
of the Moon. And there, in the forehead of the deity, gleamed the yellow
Diamond, whose splendour had last shone on me in England, from the bosom
of a woman's dress!

<P>Yes! after the lapse of eight centuries, the Moonstone looks forth once
more, over the walls of the sacred city in which its story first began.
How it has found its way back to its wild native land -- by what accident,
or by what crime, the Indians regained possession of their sacred gem,
may be in your knowledge, but is not in mine. You have lost sight of it
in England, and (if I know anything of this people) you have lost sight
of it for ever.

<P>So the years pass, and repeat each other; so the same events revolve
in the cycles of time. What will be the next adventures of the Moonstone?
Who can tell?
