A MORNING CALL.



I.



THE newspapers have announced the return of Lord and Lady

Holchester to their residence in London, after an absence on the

continent of more than six months.



It is the height of the season. All day long, within the

canonical hours, the door of Holchester House is perpetually

opening to receive visitors. The vast majority leave their cards,

and go away again. Certain privileged individuals only, get out

of their carriages, and enter the house.



Among these last, arriving at an earlier hour than is customary,

is a person of distinction who is positively bent on seeing

either the master or the mistress of the house, and who will take

no denial. While this person is parleying with the chief of the

servants , Lord Holchester, passing from one room to another,

happens to cross the inner end of the hall. The person instantly

darts at him with a cry of "Dear Lord Holchester!" Julius turns,

and sees--Lady Lundie!



He is fairly caught, and he gives way with his best grace. As he

opens the door of the nearest room for her ladyship, he furtively

consults his watch, and says in his inmost soul, "How am I to get

rid of her before the others come?"



Lady Lundie settles down on a sofa in a whirlwind of silk and

lace, and becomes, in her own majestic way, "perfectly charming."

She makes the most affectionate inquiries about Lady Holchester,

about the Dowager Lady Holchester, about Julius himself. Where

have they been? what have they seen? have time and change helped

them to recover the shock of that dreadful event, to which Lady

Lundie dare not more particularly allude? Julius answers

resignedly, and a little absently. He makes polite inquiries, on

his side, as to her ladyship's plans and proceedings--with a mind

uneasily conscious of the inexorable lapse of time, and of

certain probabilities which that lapse may bring with it. Lady

Lundie has very little to say about herself. She is only in town

for a few weeks. Her life is a life of retirement. "My modest

round of duties at Windygates, Lord Holchester; occasionally

relieved, when my mind is overworked, by the society of a few

earnest friends whose views harmonize with my own--my existence

passes (not quite uselessly, I hope) in that way. I have no news;

I see nothing--except, indeed, yesterday, a sight of the saddest

kind." She pauses there. Julius observes that he is expected to

make inquiries, and makes them accordingly.



Lady Lundie hesitates; announces that her news refers to that

painful past event which she has already touched on; acknowledges

that she could not find herself in London without feeling an act

of duty involved in making inquiries at the asylum in which

Hester Dethridge is confined for life; announces that she has not

only made the inquiries, but has seen the unhappy woman herself;

has spoken to her, has found her unconscious of her dreadful

position, incapable of the smallest exertion of memory, resigned

to the existence that she leads, and likely (in the opinion of

the medical superintendent) to live for some years to come.

Having stated these facts, her ladyship is about to make a few of

those "remarks appropriate to the occasion," in which she excels,

when the door opens; and Lady Holchester, in search of her

missing husband, enters the room.



II.



There is a new outburst of affectionate interest on Lady Lundie's

part--met civilly, but not cordially, by Lady Holchester.

Julius's wife seems, like Julius, to be uneasily conscious of the

lapse of time. Like Julius again, she privately wonders how long

Lady Lundie is going to stay.



Lady Lundie shows no signs of leaving the sofa. She has evidently

come to Holchester House to say something--and she has not said

it yet. Is she going to say it? Yes. She is going to get, by a

roundabout way, to the object in view. She has another inquiry of

the affectionate sort to make. May she be permitted to resume the

subject of Lord and Lady Holchester's travels? They have been at

Rome. Can they confirm the shocking intelligence which has

reached her of the "apostasy" of Mrs. Glenarm?



Lady Holchester can confirm it, by personal xexperience. Mrs.

Glenarm has renounced the world, and has taken refuge in the

bosom of the Holy Catholic Church. Lady Holchester has seen her

in a convent at Rome. She is passing through the period of her

probation; and she is resolved to take the veil. Lady Lundie, as

a good Protestant, lifts her hands in horror--declares the topic

to be too painful to dwell on--and, by way of varying it, goes

straight to the point at last. Has Lady I Holchester, in the

course of her continental experience, happened to meet with, or

to hear of--Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth?



"I have ceased, as you know, to hold any communication with my

relatives," Lady Lundie explains. "The course they took at the

time of our family trial--the sympathy they felt with a Person

whom I can not even now trust myself to name more

particularly--alienated us from each other. I may be grieved,

dear Lady Holchester; but I bear no malice. And I shall always

feel a motherly interest in hearing of Blanche's welfare. I have

been told that she and her husband were traveling, at the time

when you and Lord Holchester were traveling. Did you meet with

them?"



Julius and his wife looked at each other. Lord Holchester is

dumb. Lady Holchester replies:



"We saw Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth at Florence, and afterward

at Naples, Lady Lundie. They returned to England a week since, in

anticipation of a certain happy event, which will possibly

increase the members of your family circle. They are now in

London. Indeed, I may tell you that we expect them here to lunch

to-day."



Having made this plain statement, Lady Holchester looks at Lady

Lundie. (If _that_ doesn't hasten her departure, nothing will!)



Quite useless! Lady Lundie holds her ground. Having heard

absolutely nothing of her relatives for the last six months, she

is burning with curiosity to hear more. There is a name she has

not mentioned yet. She places a certain constraint upon herself,

and mentions it now.



"And Sir Patrick?" says her ladyship, subsiding into a gentle

melancholy, suggestive of past injuries condoned by Christian

forgiveness. "I only know what report tells me. Did you meet with

Sir Patrick at Florence and Naples, also?"



Julius and his wife look at each other again. The clock in the

hall strikes. Julius shudders. Lady Holchester's patience begins

to give way. There is an awkward pause. Somebody must say

something. As before, Lady Holchester replies "Sir Patrick went

abroad, Lady Lundie, with his niece and her husband; and Sir

Patrick has come back with them."



"In good health?" her ladyship inquires.



"Younger than ever," Lady Holchester rejoins.



Lady Lundie smiles satirically. Lady Holchester notices the

smile; decides that mercy shown to _this_ woman is mercy

misplaced; and announces (to her husband's horror) that she has

news to tell of Sir Patrick, which will probably take his

sister-in-law by surprise.



Lady Lundie waits eagerly to hear what the news is.



"It is no secret," Lady Holchester proceeds--"though it is only

known, as yet to a few intimate friends. Sir Patrick has made an

important change in his life."



Lady Lundie's charming smile suddenly dies out.



"Sir Patrick is not only a very clever and a very agreeable man,"

Lady Holchester resumes a little maliciously; "he is also, in all

his habits and ways (as you well know), a man younger than his

years--who still possesses many of the qualities which seldom

fail to attract women."



Lady Lundie starts to her feet.



"You don't mean to tell me, Lady Holchester, that Sir Patrick is

married?"



"I do."



Her ladyship drops back on the sofa; helpless really and truly

helpless, under the double blow that has fallen on her. She is

not only struck out of her place as the chief woman of the

family, but (still on the right side of forty) she is socially

superannuated, as The Dowager Lady Lundie, for the rest of her

life!



"At his age!" she exclaims, as soon as she can speak.



"Pardon me for reminding you," Lady Holchester answers, "that

plenty of men marry at Sir Patrick's age. In his case, it is only

due to him to say that his motive raises him beyond the reach of

ridicule or reproach. His marriage is a good action, in the

highest sense of the word. It does honor to _him,_ as well as to

the lady who shares his position and his name."



"A young girl, of course!" is Lady Lundie's next remark.



"No. A woman who has been tried by no common suffering, and who

has borne her hard lot nobly. A woman who deserves the calmer and

the happier life on which she is entering now."



"May I ask who she is?"



Before the question can be answered, a knock at the house door

announces the arrival of visitors. For the third time, Julius and

his wife  look at each other. On this occasion, Julius interferes.



"My wife has already told you, Lady Lundie, that we expect Mr.

and Mrs. Brinkworth to lunch. Sir Patrick, and the new Lady

Lundie, accompany them. If I am mistaken in supposing that it

might not be quite agreeable to you to meet them, I can only ask

your pardon. If I am right, I will leave Lady Holchester to

receive our friends, and will do myself the honor of taking you

into another room."



He advances to the door of an inner room. He offers his arm to

Lady Lundie. Her ladyship stands immovable; determined to see the

woman who has supplanted her. In a moment more, the door of

entrance from the hall is thrown open; and the servant announces,

"Sir Patrick and Lady Lundie. Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth."



Lady Lundie looks at the woman who has taken her place at the

head of the family; and sees--ANNE SILVESTER!
