CHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH.



THE LETTER AND THE LAW.



THE many-toned murmur of the current of London life--flowing

through the murky channel of Drury Lane--found its muffled way

from the front room to the back. Piles of old music lumbered the

dusty floor. Stage masks and weapons, and portraits of singers

and dancers, hung round the walls. An empty violin case in one

corner faced a broken bust of Rossini in another. A frameless

print, representing the Trial of Queen Caroline, was pasted over

the fireplace. The chairs were genuine specimens of ancient

carving in oak. The table was an equally excellent example of

dirty modern deal. A small morsel of drugget was on the floor;

and a large deposit of soot was on the ceiling. The scene thus

presented, revealed itself in the back drawing-room of a house in

Drury Lane, devoted to the transaction of musical and theatrical

business of the humbler sort. It was late in the afternoon, on

Michaelmas-day. Two persons were seated together in the room:

they were Anne Silvester and Sir Patrick Lundie.



The opening conversation between them--comprising, on one side,

the narrative of what had happened at Perth and at Swanhaven;

and, on the other, a statement of the circumstances attending the

separation of Arnold and Blanche--had come to an end. It rested

with Sir Patrick to lead the way to the next topic. He looked at

his companion, and hesitated.



"Do you feel strong enough to go on?" he asked. "If you would

prefer to rest a little, pray say so."



"Thank you, Sir Patrick. I am more than ready, I a m eager, to go

on. No words can say how anxious I feel to be of some use to you,

if I can. It rests entirely with your experience to show me how."



"I can only do that, Miss Silvester, by asking you without

ceremony for all the information that I want. Had you any object

in traveling to London, which you have not mentioned to me yet? I

mean, of course, any object with which I hare a claim (as Arnold

Brinkworth's representative) to be acquainted?"



"I had an object, Sir Patrick. And I have failed to accomplish

it."



"May I ask what it was?"



"It was to see Geoffrey Delamayn."



Sir Patrick started. "You have attempted to see _him!_ When?"



"This morning."



"Why, you only arrived in London last night!"



"I only arrived," said Anne, "after waiting many days on the

journey. I was obliged to rest at Edinburgh, and again at

York--and I was afraid I had given Mrs. Glenarm time enough to

get to Geoffrey Delamayn before me."



"Afraid?" repeated Sir Patrick. "I understood that you had no

serious intention of disputing the scoundrel with Mrs. Glenarm.

What motive could possibly have taken you _his_ way?"



"The same motive which took me to Swanhaven."



"What! the idea that it rested with Delamayn to set things right?

and that you might bribe him to do it, by consenting to release

him, so far as your claims were concerned?"



"Bear with my folly, Sir Patrick, as patiently as you can! I am

always alone now; and I get into a habit of brooding over things.

I have been brooding over the position in which my misfortunes

have placed Mr. Brinkworth. I have been obstinate--unreasonably

obstinate--in believing that I could prevail with Geoffrey

Delamayn, after I had failed with Mrs. Glenarm. I am obstinate

about it still. If he would only have heard me, my madness in

going to Fulham might have had its excuse." She sighed bitterly,

and said no more.



Sir Patrick took her hand.



"It _has_ its excuse," he said, kindly. "Your motive is beyond

reproach. Let me add--to quiet your mind--that, even if Delamayn

had been willing to hear you, and had accepted the condition, the

result would still have been the same. You are quite wrong in

supposing that he has only to speak, and to set this matter

right. It has passed entirely beyond his control. The mischief

was done when Arnold Brinkworth spent those unlucky hours with

you at Craig Fernie."



"Oh, Sir Patrick, if I had only known that, before I went to

Fulham this morning!"



She shuddered as she said the words. Something was plainly

associated with her visit to Geoffrey, the bare remembrance of

which shook her nerves. What was it? Sir Patrick resolved to

obtain an answer to that question, before be ventured on

proceeding further with the main object of the interview.



"You have told me your reason for going to Fulham," he said. "But

I have not heard what happened there yet."



Anne hesitated. "Is it necessary for me to trouble you about

that?" she asked--with evident reluctance to enter on the

subject.



"It is absolutely necessary," answered Sir Patrick, "because

Delamayn is concerned in it."



Anne summoned her resolution, and entered on her narrative in

these words:







"The person who carries on the business here discovered the

address for me," she began. "I had some difficulty, however, in

finding the house. It is little more than a cottage; and it is

quite lost in a great garden, surrounded by high walls. I saw a

carriage waiting. The coachman was walking his horses up and

down--and he showed me the door. It was a high wooden door in the

wall, with a grating in it. I rang the bell. A servant-girl

opened the grating, and looked at me. She refused to let me in.

Her mistress had ordered her to close the door on all

strangers--especially strangers who were women. I contrived to

pass some money to her through the grating, and asked to speak to

her mistress. After waiting some time, I saw another face behind

the bars--and it struck me that I recognized it. I suppose I was

nervous. It startled me. I said, 'I think we know each other.'

There was no answer. The door was suddenly opened--and who do you

think stood before me?"



"Was it somebody I know?"



"Yes."



"Man? or woman?"



"It was Hester Dethridge."



"Hester Dethridge!"



"Yes. Dressed just as usual, and looking just as usual--with her

slate hanging at her side."



"Astonishing! Where did I last see her? At the Windygates

station, to be sure--going to London, after she had left my

sister-in-law's service. Has she accepted another place--without

letting me know first, as I told her?"



"She is living at Fulham."



"In service?"



"No. As mistress of her own house."



"What! Hester Dethridge in possession of a house of her own?

Well! well! why shouldn't she have a rise in the world like other

people? Did she let you in?"



"She stood for some time looking at me, in that dull strange way

that she has. The servants at Windygates always said she was not

in her right mind--and you will say, Sir Patrick, when you hear

what happened, that the servants were not mistaken. She must be

mad. I said, 'Don't you remember me?' She lifted her slate, and

wrote, 'I remember you, in a dead swoon at Windygates House.' I

was quite unaware that she had been present when I fainted in the

library. The discovery startled me--or that dreadful, dead-cold

look that she has in her eyes startled me--I don't know which. I

couldn't speak to her just at first. She wrote on her slate

again--the strangest question--in these words: 'I said, at the

time, brought to it by a man. Did I say true?' If the question

had been put in the usual way, by any body else, I should have

considered it too insolent to be noticed. Can you understand my

answering it, Sir Patrick? I can't understand it myself, now--and

yet I did answer. She forced me to it with her stony eyes. I said

'yes.' "



"Did all this take place at the door?"



"At the door."



"When did she let you in?"



"The next thing she did was to let me in. She took me by the arm,

in a rough way, and drew me inside the door, and shut it. My

nerves are broken; my courage is gone. I crept with cold when she

touched me. She dropped my arm. I stood like a child, waiting for

what it pleased her to say or do next. She rested her two hands

on her sides, and took a long look at me. She made a horrid dumb

sound--not as if she was angry; more, if such a thing could be,

as if she was satisfied--pleased even, I should have said, if it

had been any body but Hester Dethridge. Do you understand it?"



"Not yet. Let me get nearer to understanding it by asking

something before you go on. Did she show any attachment to you,

when you were both at Windygates?"



"Not the least. She appeared to be incapable of attachment to me,

or to any body."



"Did she write any more questions on her slate?"



"Yes. She wrote another question under what she had written just

before. Her mind was still running on my fainting fit, and on the

'man' who had 'brought me to it.' She held up the slate; and the

words were these: 'Tell me how he served you, did he knock you

down?' Most people would have laughed at the question. _I_ was

startled by it. I told her, No. She shook her head as if she

didn't believe me. She wrote on her slate, 'We are loth to own it

when they up with their fists and beat us--ain't we?' I said,

'You are quite wrong.' She went on obstinately with her writing.

'Who is the man?'--was her next question. I had control enough

over myself to decline telling her that. She opened the door, and

pointed to me to go out. I made a sign entreating her to wait a

little. She went back, in her impenetrable way, to the writing on

the slate--still about the 'man.' This time, the question was

plainer still. She had evidently placed her own interpretation of

my appearance at the house. She wrote, 'Is it the man who lodges

here?' I saw that she would close the door on me if I didn't

answer. My only chance with her was to own that she had guessed

right. I said 'Yes. I want to see him.' She took me by the arm,

as roughly as before--and led me into the house."



"I begin to understand her," said Sir Patrick. "I remember

hearing, in my brother's time, that she had been brutally

ill-used by her husband. The association of id eas, even in _her_

confused brain, becomes plain, if you bear that in mind. What is

her last remembrance of you? It is the remembrance of a fainting

woman at Windygates."



"Yes."



"She makes you acknowledge that she has guessed right, in

guessing that a man was, in some way, answerable for the

condition in which she found you. A swoon produced by a shock

indicted on the mind, is a swoon that she doesn't understand. She

looks back into her own experience, and associates it with the

exercise of actual physical brutality on the part of the man. And

she sees, in you, a reflection of her own sufferings and her own

case. It's curious--to a student of human nature. And it

explains, what is otherwise unintelligible--her overlooking her

own instructions to the servant, and letting you into the house.

What happened next?"



"She took me into a room, which I suppose was her own room. She

made signs, offering me tea. It was done in the strangest

way--without the least appearance of kindness. After what you

have just said to me, I think I can in some degree interpret what

was going on in her mind. I believe she felt a hard-hearted

interest in seeing a woman whom she supposed to be as unfortunate

as she had once been herself. I declined taking any tea, and

tried to return to the subject of what I wanted in the house. She

paid no heed to me. She pointed round the room; and then took me

to a window, and pointed round the garden--and then made a sign

indicating herself. 'My house; and my garden'--that was what she

meant. There were four men in the garden--and Geoffrey Delamayn

was one of them. I made another attempt to tell her that I wanted

to speak to him. But, no! She had her own idea in her mind. After

beckoning to me to leave the window, she led the way to the

fire-place, and showed me a sheet of paper with writing on it,

framed and placed under a glass, and hung on the wall. She

seemed, I thought, to feel some kind of pride in her framed

manuscript. At any rate, she insisted on my reading it. It was an

extract from a will."



"The will under which she had inherited the house?"



"Yes. Her brother's will. It said, that he regretted, on his

death-bed, his estrangement from his only sister, dating from the

time when she had married in defiance of his wishes and against

his advice. As a proof of his sincere desire to be reconciled

with her, before he died, and as some compensation for the

sufferings that she had endured at the hands of her deceased

husband, he left her an income of two hundred pounds a year,

together with the use of his house and garden, for her lifetime.

That, as well as I remember, was the substance of what it said."



"Creditable to her brother, and creditable to herself," said Sir

Patrick. "Taking her odd character into consideration, I

understand her liking it to be seen. What puzzles me, is her

letting lodgings with an income of her own to live on."



"That was the very question which I put to her myself. I was

obliged to be cautious, and to begin by asking about the lodgers

first--the men being still visible out in the garden, to excuse

the inquiry. The rooms to let in the house had (as I understood

her) been taken by a person acting for Geoffrey Delamayn--his

trainer, I presume. He had surprised Hester Dethridge by barely

noticing the house, and showing the most extraordinary interest

in the garden."



"That is quite intelligible, Miss Silvester. The garden you have

described would be just the place he wanted for the exercises of

his employer--plenty of space, and well secured from observation

by the high walls all round. What next?"



"Next, I got to the question of why she should let her house in

lodgings at all. When I asked her that, her face turned harder

than ever. She answered me on her slate in these dismal words: 'I

have not got a friend in the world. I dare not live alone.' There

was her reason! Dreary and dreadful, Sir Patrick, was it not?"



"Dreary indeed! How did it end? Did you get into the garden?"



"Yes--at the second attempt. She seemed suddenly to change her

mind; she opened the door for me herself. Passing the window of

the room in which I had left her, I looked back. She had taken

her place, at a table before the window, apparently watching for

what might happen. There was something about her, as her eyes met

mine (I can't say what), which made me feel uneasy at the time.

Adopting your view, I am almost inclined to think now, horrid as

the idea is, that she had the expectation of seeing me treated as

_she_ had been treated in former days. It was actually a relief

to me--though I knew I was going to run a serious risk--to lose

sight of her. As I got nearer to the men in the garden, I heard

two of them talking very earnestly to Geoffrey Delamayn. The

fourth person, an elderly gentleman, stood apart from the rest at

some little distance. I kept as far as I could out of sight,

waiting till the talk was over. It was impossible for me to help

hearing it. The two men were trying to persuade Geoffrey Delamayn

to speak to the elderly gentleman. They pointed to him as a

famous medical man. They reiterated over and over again, that his

opinion was well worth having--"



Sir Patrick interrupted her. "Did they mention his name?" he

asked.



"Yes. They called him Mr. Speedwell."



"The man himself! This is even more interesting, Miss Silvester,

than you suppose. I myself heard Mr. Speedwell warn Delamayn that

he was in broken health, when we were visiting together at

Windygates House last month. Did he do as the other men wished

him? Did he speak to the surgeon?"



"No. He sulkily refused--he remembered what you remember. He

said, 'See the man who told me I was broken down?--not I!' After

confirming it with an oath, he turned away from the others.

Unfortunately, he took the direction in which I was standing, and

discovered me. The bare sight of me seemed to throw him instantly

into a state of frenzy. He--it is impossible for me to repeat the

language that he used: it is bad enough to have heard it. I

believe, Sir Patrick, but for the two men, who ran up and laid

hold of him, that Hester Dethridge would have seen what she

expected to see. The change in him was so frightful--even to me,

well as I thought I knew him in his fits of passion--I tremble

when I think of it. One of the men who had restrained him was

almost as brutal, in his way. He declared, in the foulest

language, that if Delamayn had a fit, he would lose the race, and

that I should be answerable for it. But for Mr. Speedwell, I

don't know what I should have done. He came forward directly.

'This is no place either for you, or for me,' he said--and gave

me his arm, and led me back to the house. Hester Dethridge met us

in the passage, and lifted her hand to stop me. Mr. Speedwell

asked her what she wanted. She looked at me, and then looked

toward the garden, and made the motion of striking a blow with

her clenched fist. For the first time in my experience of her--I

hope it was my fancy--I thought I saw her smile. Mr. Speedwell

took me out. 'They are well matched in that house,' he said. 'The

woman is as complete a savage as the men.' The carriage which I

had seen waiting at the door was his. He called it up, and

politely offered me a place in it. I said I would only trespass

on his kindness as far as to the railway station. While we were

talking, Hester Dethridge followed us to the door. She made the

same motion again with her clenched hand, and looked back toward

the garden--and then looked at me, and nodded her head, as much

as to say, 'He will do it yet!' No words can describe how glad I

was to see the last of her. I hope and trust I shall never set

eyes on her again!"



"Did you hear how Mr. Speedwell came to be at the house? Had he

gone of his own accord? or had he been sent for?"



"He had been sent for. I ventured to speak to him about the

persons whom I had seen in the garden. Mr. Speedwell explained

everything which I was not able of myself to understand, in the

kindest manner. One of the two strange men in the garden was the

trainer; the other was a doctor, whom the trainer was usually in

the habit of consulting. It seems that the real reason for their

bringing Geof frey Delamayn away from Scotland when they did, was

that the trainer was uneasy, and wanted to be near London for

medical advice. The doctor, on being consulted, owned that he was

at a loss to understand the symptoms which he was asked to treat.

He had himself fetched the great surgeon to Fulham, that morning.

Mr. Speedwell abstained from mentioning that he had foreseen what

would happen, at Windygates. All he said was, 'I had met Mr.

Delamayn in society, and I felt interest enough in the case to

pay him a visit--with what result, you have seen yourself.' "



"Did he tell you any thing about Delamayn's health?"



"He said that he had questioned the doctor on the way to Fulham,

and that some of the patient's symptoms indicated serious

mischief. What the symptoms were I did not hear. Mr. Speedwell

only spoke of changes for the worse in him which a woman would be

likely to understand. At one time, he would be so dull and

heedless that nothing could rouse him. At another, he flew into

the most terrible passions without any apparent cause. The

trainer had found it almost impossible (in Scotland) to keep him

to the right diet; and the doctor had only sanctioned taking the

house at Fulham, after being first satisfied, not only of the

convenience of the garden, but also that Hester Dethridge could

be thoroughly trusted as a cook. With her help, they had placed

him on an entirely new diet. But they had found an unexpected

difficulty even in doing that. When the trainer took him to the

new lodgings, it turned out that he had seen Hester Dethridge at

Windygates, and had taken the strongest prejudice against her. On

seeing her again at Fulham, he appeared to be absolutely

terrified."



"Terrified? Why?"



"Nobody knows why. The trainer and the doctor together could only

prevent his leaving the house, by threatening to throw up the

responsibility of preparing him for the race, unless he instantly

controlled himself, and behaved like a man instead of a child.

Since that time, he has become reconciled, little by little, to

his new abode--partly through Hester Dethridge's caution in

keeping herself always out of his way; and partly through his own

appreciation of the change in his diet, which Hester's skill in

cookery has enabled the doctor to make. Mr. Speedwell mentioned

some things which I have forgotten. I can only repeat, Sir

Patrick, the result at which he has arrived in his own mind.

Coming from a man of his authority, the opinion seems to me to be

startling in the last degree. If Geoffrey Delamayn runs in the

race on Thursday next, he will do it at the risk of his life."



"At the risk of dying on the ground?"



"Yes."



Sir Patrick's face became thoughtful. He waited a little before

he spoke again.



"We have not wasted our time," he said, "in dwelling on what

happened during your visit to Fulham. The possibility of this

man's death suggests to my mind serious matter for consideration.

It is very desirable, in the interests of my niece and her

husband, that I should be able to foresee, if I can, how a fatal

result of the race might affect the inquiry which is to be held

on Saturday next. I believe you may be able to help me in this."



"You have only to tell me how, Sir Patrick."



"I may count on your being present on Saturday?"



"Certainly."



"You thoroughly understand that, in meeting Blanche, you will

meet a person estranged from you, for the present--a friend and

sister who has ceased (under Lady Lundie's influence mainly) to

feel as a friend and sister toward you now?"



"I was not quite unprepared, Sir Patrick, to hear that Blanche

had misjudged me. When I wrote my letter to Mr. Brinkworth, I

warned him as delicately as I could, that his wife's jealousy

might be very easily roused. You may rely on my self-restraint,

no matter how hardly it may be tried. Nothing that Blanche can

say or do will alter my grateful remembrance of the past. While I

live, I love her. Let that assurance quiet any little anxiety

that you may have felt as to my conduct--and tell me how I can

serve those interests which I have at heart as well as you."



"You can serve them, Miss Silvester, in this way. You can make me

acquainted with the position in which you stood toward Delamayn

at the time when you went to the Craig Fernie inn."



"Put any questions to me that you think right, Sir Patrick."



"You mean that?"



"I mean it."



"I will begin by recalling something which you have already told

me. Delamayn has promised you marriage--"



"Over and over again!"



"In words?"



"Yes."



"In writing?"



"Yes."



"Do you see what I am coming to?"



"Hardly yet."



"You referred, when we first met in this room, to a letter which

you recovered from Bishopriggs, at Perth. I have ascertained from

Arnold Brinkworth that the sheet of note-paper stolen from you

contained two letters. One was written by you to Delamayn--the

other was written by Delamayn to you. The substance of this last

Arnold remembered. Your letter he had not read. It is of the

utmost importance, Miss Silvester, to let me see that

correspondence before we part to-day."



Anne made no answer. She sat with her clasped hands on her lap.

Her eyes looked uneasily away from Sir Patrick's face, for the

first time.



"Will it not be enough," she asked, after an interval, "if I tell

you the substance of my letter, without showing it?"



"It will _not_ be enough," returned Sir Patrick, in the plainest

manner. "I hinted--if you remember--at the propriety of my seeing

the letter, when you first mentioned it, and I observed that you

purposely abstained from understanding me, I am grieved to put

you, on this occasion, to a painful test. But if you _are_ to

help me at this serious crisis, I have shown you the way."



Anne rose from her chair, and answered by putting the letter into

Sir Patrick's hands. "Remember what he has done, since I wrote

that," she said. "And try to excuse me, if I own that I am

ashamed to show it to you now."



With those words she walked aside to the window. She stood there,

with her hand pressed on her breast, looking out absently on the

murky London view of house roof and chimney, while Sir Patrick

opened the letter.



It is necessary to the right appreciation of events, that other

eyes besides Sir Patrick's should follow the brief course of the

WINDYGATES HOUSE. _August_ 19, 1868.



"GEOFFREY DELAMAYN,--I have waited in the hope that you would

ride over from your brother's place, and see me--and I have

waited in vain. Your conduct to me is cruelty itself; I will bear

it no longer. Consider! in your own interests, consider--before

you drive the miserable woman who has trusted you to despair. You

have promised me marriage by all that is sacred. I claim your

promise. I insist on nothing less than to be what you vowed I

should be--what I have waited all this weary time to be--what I

_am,_ in the sight of Heaven, your wedded wife. Lady Lundie gives

a lawn-party here on the 14th. I know you have been asked. I

expect you to accept her invitation. If I don't see you, I won't

answer for what may happen. My mind is made up to endure this

suspense no longer. Oh, Geoffrey, remember the past! Be

faithful--be just--to your loving wife,



"ANNE SILVESTER."



2. _From Geoffrey Delamayn to Anne Silvester._



"DEAR ANNE,--Just called to London to my father. They have

telegraphed him in a bad way. Stop where you are, and I will

write you. Trust the bearer. Upon my soul, I'll keep my promise.

Your loving husband that is to be,

"In a mortal hurry. The train starts 4.30."







Sir Patrick read the correspondence with breathless attention to

the end. At the last lines of the last letter he did what he had

not done for twenty years past--he sprang to his feet at a bound,

and he crossed a room without the help of his ivory cane.



Anne started; and turning round from the window, looked at him in

silent surprise. He was under the influence of strong emotion;

his face, his voice, his manner, all showed it.



"How long had you been in Scotland, when you wrote this?" He

pointed to Anne's letter as he asked the question, put ting it so

eagerly that he stammered over the first words. "More than three

weeks?" he added, with his bright black eyes fixed in absorbing

interest on her face.



"Yes."



"Are you sure of that?"



"I am certain of it."



"You can refer to persons who have seen you?"



"Easily."



He turned the sheet of note-paper, and pointed to Geoffrey's

penciled letter on the fourth page.



"How long had _he_ been in Scotland, when _he_ wrote this? More

than three weeks, too?"



Anne considered for a moment.



"For God's sake, be careful!" said Sir Patrick. "You don't know

what depends on this, If your memory is not clear about it, say

so."



"My memory was confused for a moment. It is clear again now. He

had been at his brother's in Perthshire three weeks before he

wrote that. And before he went to Swanhaven, he spent three or

four days in the valley of the Esk."



"Are you sure again?"



"Quite sure!"



"Do you know of any one who saw him in the valley of the Esk?"



"I know of a person who took a note to him, from me."



"A person easily found?"



"Quite easily."



Sir Patrick laid aside the letter, and seized in ungovernable

agitation on both her hands.



"Listen to me," he said. "The whole conspiracy against Arnold

Brinkworth and you falls to the ground before that

correspondence. When you and he met at the inn--"



He paused, and looked at her. Her hands were beginning to tremble

in his.



"When you and Arnold Brinkworth met at the inn," he resumed, "the

law of Scotland had made you a married woman. On the day, and at

the hour, when he wrote those lines at the back of your letter to

him, you were _Geoffrey Delamayn's wedded wife!_"



He stopped, and looked at her again.



Without a word in reply, without the slightest movement in her

from head to foot, she looked back at him. The blank stillness of

horror was in her face. The deadly cold of horror was in her

hands.



In silence, on his side, Sir Patrick drew back a step, with a

faint reflection of _her_ dismay in his face. Married--to the

villain who had not hesitated to calumniate the woman whom he had

ruined, and then to cast her helpless on the world. Married--to

the traitor who had not shrunk from betraying Arnold's trust in

him, and desolating Arnold's home. Married--to the ruffian who

would have struck her that morning, if the hands of his own

friends had not held him back. And Sir Patrick had never thought

of it! Absorbed in the one idea of Blanche's future, he had never

thought of it, till that horror-stricken face looked at him, and

said, Think of _my_ future, too!



He came back to her. He took her cold hand once more in his.



"Forgive me," he said, "for thinking first of Blanche."



Blanche's name seemed to rouse her. The life came back to her

face; the tender brightness began to shine again in her eyes. He

saw that he might venture to speak more plainly still: he went

on.



"I see the dreadful sacrifice as _you_ see it. I ask myself, have

I any right, has Blanche any right--"



She stopped him by a faint pressure of his hand.



"Yes," she said, softly, "if Blanche's happiness depends on it."
