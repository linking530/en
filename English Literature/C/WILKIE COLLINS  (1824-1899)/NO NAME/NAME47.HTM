<CENTER><I>From Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril.</I></CENTER>


<P>"Westmoreland House, January 3d, 1848.

<P>"DEAR MR. PENDRIL--I write, as you kindly requested, to report how Norah
is going on, and to tell you what changes I see for the better in the state
of her mind on the subject of her sister.

<P>"I cannot say that she is becoming resigned to Magdalen's continued
silence--I know her faithful nature too well to say it. I can only tell
you that she is beginning to find relief from the heavy pressure of sorrow
and suspense in new thoughts and new hopes. I doubt if she has yet realized
this in her own mind; but I see the result, although she is not conscious
of it herself. I see her heart opening to the consolation of another interest
and another love. She has not said a word to me on the subject, nor have
I said a word to her. But as certainly as I know that Mr. George Bartram's
visits have lately grown more and more frequent to the family at Portland
Place--so certainly I can assure you that Norah is finding a relief under
her suspense, which is not of my bringing, and a hope in the future, which
I have not taught her to feel.

<P>"It is needless for me to say that I tell you this in the strictest
confidence. God knows whether the happy prospect which seems to me to be
just dawning will grow brighter or not as time goes on. The oftener I see
Mr. George Bartram--and he has called on me more than once--the stronger
my liking for him grows. To my poor judgment he seems to be a gentleman
in the highest and truest sense of the word. If I could live to see Norah
his wife, I should almost feel that I had lived long enough. But who can
discern the future? We have suffered so much that I am afraid to hope.

<P>"Have you heard anything of Magdalen? I don't know why or how it is;
but since I have known of her husband's death, my old tenderness for her
seems to cling to me more obstinately than ever. Always yours truly,
<BR>"HARRIET GARTH."

<CENTER><I>From Mr. Pendril to Miss Garth.</I></CENTER>


<P>"Serle Street, January 4th, 1848.
<BR>"DEAR MISS GARTH--Of Mrs. Noel Vanstone herself I have heard nothing.
But I have learned, since I saw you, that the report of the position in
which she is left by the death of her husband may be depended upon as the
truth. No legacy of any kind is bequeathed to her. Her name is not once
mentioned in her husband's will.

<P>"Knowing what we know, it is not to be concealed that this circumstance
threatens us with more embarrassment, and perhaps with more distress. Mrs.
Noel Vanstone is not the woman to submit, without a desperate resistance,
to the total overthrow of all her schemes and all her hopes. The mere fact
that nothing whatever has been heard of her since her husband's death is
suggestive to my mind of serious mischief to come. In her situation, and
with her temper, the quieter she is now, the more inveterately I, for one,
distrust her in the future. It is impossible to say to what violent measures
her present extremity may not drive her. It is impossible to feel sure
that she may not be the cause of some public scandal this time, which may
affect her innocent sister as well as herself.

<P>"I know you will not misinterpret the motive which has led me to write
these lines; I know you will not think that I am inconsiderate enough to
cause you unnecessary alarm. My sincere anxiety to see that happy prospect
realized to which your letter alludes has caused me to write far less reservedly
than I might otherwise have written. I strongly urge you to use your influence,
on every occasion when you can fairly exert it, to strengthen that growing
attachment, and to place it beyond the reach of any coming disasters, while
you have the opportunity of doing so. When I tell you that the fortune
of which Mrs. Noel Vanstone has been deprived is entirely bequeathed to
Admiral Bartram; and when I add that Mr. George Bartram is generally understood
to be his uncle's heir--you will, I think, acknowledge that I am not warning
you without a cause. Yours most truly,
<BR>"WILLIAM PENDRIL."

<CENTER><I>From Admiral Bartram to Mrs. Drake</I></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>(housekeeper at St. Crux).</I></CENTER>


<P>"St. Crux, January 10th, 1848.
<BR>"MRS. DRAKE--I have received your letter from London, stating that
you have found me a new parlor-maid at last, and that the girl is ready
to return with you to St. Crux when your other errands in town allow you
to come back.

<P>"This arrangement must be altered immediately, for a reason which I
am heartily sorry to have to write.

<P>"The illness of my niece, Mrs. Girdlestone--which appeared to be so
slight as to alarm none of us, doctors included--has ended fatally. I received
this morning the shocking news of her death. Her husband is said to be
quite frantic with grief. Mr. George has already gone to his brother-in-law's,
to superintend the last melancholy duties and I must follow him before
the funeral takes place. We propose to take Mr. Girdlestone away afterward,
and to try the effect on him of change of place and new scenes. Under these
sad circumstances, I may be absent from St. Crux a month or six weeks at
least; the house will be shut up, and the new servant will not be wanted
until my return.

<P>"You will therefore tell the girl, on receiving this letter, that a
death in the family has caused a temporary change in our arrangements.
If she is willing to wait, you may safely engage her to come here in six
weeks' time; I shall be back then, if Mr. George is not. If she refuses,
pay her what compensation is right, and so have done with her. Yours,
<BR>ARTHUR BARTRAM."

<P>"January 11th.
<BR>"HONORED SIR--I hope to get my errands done, and to return to St. Crux
to-morrow, but write to save you anxiety, in case of delay.

<P>"The young woman whom I have engaged (Louisa by name) is willing to
wait your time; and her present mistress, taking an interest in her welfare,
will provide for her during the interval. She understands that she is to
enter on her new service in six weeks from the present date--namely, on
the twenty-fifth of February next.

<P>"Begging you will accept my respectful sympathy under the sad bereavement
which has befallen the family,

<P>"I remain, honored sir, your humble servant,
<BR>"SOPHIA DRAKE."
