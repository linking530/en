THE STORY CONTINUED BY MARIAN HALCOMBE (in Extracts from her Diary)</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>LIMMERIDGE HOUSE, NOV. 8.</CENTER>


<P>THIS morning Mr Gilmore left us.

<P>His interview with Laura had evidently grieved and surprised him more
than he liked to confess. I felt afraid, from his look and manner when
we parted, that she might have inadvertently betrayed to him the real secret
of her depression and my anxiety. This doubt grew on me so, after he had
gone, that I declined riding out with Sir Percival, and went up to Laura's
room instead.

<P>I have been sadly distrustful of myself, in this difficult and

<P>* The passages omitted, here and elsewhere, in Miss Halcombe's Diary
are only those which bear no reference to Miss Fairlie or to any of the
persons with whom she is associated in these pages. lamentable matter,
ever since I found out my own ignorance of the strength of Laura's unhappy
attachment. I ought to have known that the delicacy and forbearance and
sense of honour which drew me to poor Hartright, and made me so sincerely
admire and respect him, were just the qualities to appeal most irresistibly
to Laura's natural sensitiveness and natural generosity of nature. And
yet, until she opened her heart to me of her own accord, I had no suspicion
that this new feeling had taken root so deeply. I once thought time and
care might remove it. I now fear that it will remain with her and alter
her for life. The discovery that I have committed such an error in judgment
as this makes me hesitate about everything else. I hesitate about Sir Percival,
in the face of the plainest proofs. I hesitate even in speaking to Laura.
On this very morning I doubted, with my hand on the door, whether I should
ask her the questions I had come to put, or not.

<P>When I went into her room I found her walking up and down in great impatience.
She looked flushed and excited, and she came forward at once, and spoke
to me before I could open my lips.

<P>`I wanted you,' she said. `Come and sit down on the sofa with me. Marian!
I can bear this no longer -- I must and will end it.'

<P>There was too much colour in her cheeks, too much energy in her manner,
too much firmness in her voice. The little book of Hartright's drawings
-- the fatal book that she will dream over whenever she is alone -- was
in one of her hands. I began by gently and firmly taking it from her, and
putting it out of sight on a side-table.

<P>`Tell me quietly, my darling, what you wish to do,' I said. `Has Mr
Gilmore been advising you?'

<P>She shook her head. `No, not in what I am thinking of now. He was very
kind and good to me, Marian, and I am ashamed to say I distressed him by
crying. I am miserably helpless -- I can't control myself. For my own sake,
and for all our sakes, I must have courage enough to end it.'

<P>`Do you mean courage enough to claim your release?' I asked.

<P>`No,' she said simply. `Courage, dear, to tell the truth.'

<P>She put her arms round my neck, and rested her head quietly on my bosom
On the opposite wall hung the miniature portrait of her father. I bent
over her, and saw that she was looking at it while her head lay on my breast.

<P>`I can never claim my release from my engagement,' she went on. `Whatever
way it ends it must end wretchedly for me. All l can do, Marian, is not
to add the remembrance that I have broken my promise and forgotten my father's
dying words, to make that wretchedness worse.'

<P>`What is it you propose, then?' I asked.

<P>`To tell Sir Percival Glyde the truth with my own lips,' she answered.
`and to let him release me, if he will, not because I ask him, but because
he knows all.'

<P>`What do you mean, Laura, by ``all''? Sir Percival will know enough
(he has told me so himself) ii he knows that the engagement is opposed
to your own wishes.'

<P>`Can I tell him that, when the engagement was made for me by my father,
with my own consent? I should have kept my promise, not happily. I am afraid,
but still contentedly --' she stopped, turned her face to me, and laid
her cheek close against mine -- `I should have kept my engagement, Marian,
if another love had not grown up in my heart, which was not there when
I first promised to be Sir Percival's wife.'

<P>`Laura! you will never lower yourself by making a confession to him?'

<P>`I shall lower myself, indeed, if I gain my release by hiding from him
what he has a right to know.'

<P>`He has not the shadow of a right to know it!'

<P>`Wrong, Marian, wrong! I ought to deceive no one -- least of all the
man to whom my father gave me, and to whom I gave myself.' She put her
lips to mine, and kissed me. `My own love,' she said softly, `you are so
much too fond of me, and so much too proud of me, that you forget, in my
case, what you would remember in your own. Better that Sir Percival should
doubt my motives, and misjudge my conduct if he will, than that I should
be first false to him in thought, and then mean enough to serve my own
interests by hiding the falsehood.'

<P>I held her away from me in astonishment. For the first time in our lifes
we had changed places -- the resolution was all on her side, the hesitation
all on mine. I looked into the pale, quiet, resigned young face -- I saw
the pure, innocent heart, in the loving eyes that looked back at me --
and the poor worldly cautions and objections that rose to my lips dwindled
and died away in their own emptiness. I hung my head in silence. In her
place the despicably small pride which makes so many women deceitful would
have been my pride, and would have made me deceitful too.

<P>`Don't be angry with me, Marian,' she said, mistaking my silence.

<P>I only answered by drawing her close to me again. I was afraid of crying
if I spoke. My tears do not flow so easily as they ought -- they come almost
like men's tears, with sobs that seem to tear me in pieces, and that frighten
every one about me.

<P>`I have thought of this, love, for many days,' she went on, twining
and twisting my hair with that childish restlessness in her fingers, which
Poor Mrs Vesey still tries so patiently and so vainly to cure her of --
`I have thought of it very seriously, and I can be sure of my courage when
my own conscience tells me I am right. Let me speak to him tomorrow --
in your presence, Marian. I will say nothing that is wrong, nothing that
you or I need be ashamed of -- but, oh, it will ease my heart so to end
this miserable concealment! Only let me know and feel that I have no deception
to answer for on <I>my</I> side, and then, when he has heard what I have
to say, let him act towards me as he will.'

<P>She sighed, and put her head back in its old position on my bosom. Sad
misgivings about what the end would be weighed upon my mind, but still
distrusting myself, I told her that I would do as she wished. She thanked
me, and we passed gradually into talking of other things.

<P>At dinner she joined us again, and was more easy and more herself with
Sir Percival than I have seen her yet. In the evening she went to the piano,
choosing new music of the dexterous, tuneless, florid kind. The lovely
old melodies of Mozart, which poor Hartright was so fond of, she has never
played since he left. The book is no longer in the music-stand. She took
the volume away herself, so that nobody might find it out and ask her to
play from it.

<P>I had no opportunity of discovering whether her purpose of the morning
had changed or not, until she wished Sir Percival good-night -- and then
her own words informed me that it was unaltered. She said, very quietly,
that she wished to speak to him after breakfast, and that he would find
her in her sitting-room with me. He changed colour at those words, and
I felt his hand trembling a little when it came to my turn to take it.
The event of the next morning would decide his future life, and he evidently
knew it.

<P>I went in, as usual, through the door between our two bedrooms, to bid
Laura good-night before she went to sleep. In stooping over her to kiss
her I saw the little book of Hartright's drawings half hidden under her
pillow, just in the place where she used to hide her favourite toys when
she was a child. I could not find it in my heart to say anything, but I
pointed to the book and shook my head. She reached both hands up to my
cheeks, and drew my face down to hers till our lips met.

<P>`Leave it there tonight,' she whispered: `tomorrow may be cruel, and
may make me say good-bye to it for ever.'

<P>9th. -- The first event of the morning was not of a kind to raise my
spirits -- a letter arrived for me from poor Walter Hartright. It is the
answer to mine describing the manner in which Sir Percival cleared himself
of the suspicions raised by Anne Catherine's letter. He writes shortly
and bitterly about Sir Percival's explanations, only carrying that he has
no right to offer an opinion on the conduct of those who are above him.
This is sad, but his occasional references to himself grieve me still more.
He says that the effort to return to his old habits and pursuits grows
harder instead of easier to him every day, and he implores me, if I have
any interest, to exert it to get him employment that will necessitate his
absence from England, and take him among new scenes and new people. I have
been made all the readier to comply with this request by a passage at the
end of his letter, which has almost alarmed me.

<P>After mentioning that he has neither seen nor heard anything of Anne
Catherick, he suddenly breaks off, and hints in the most abrupt, mysterious
manner, that he has been perpetually watched and followed by strange men
ever since he returned to London. He acknowledges that he cannot prove
this extraordinary suspicion by fixing on any particular persons, but he
declares that the suspicion itself is present to him night and day. This
has frightened me, because it looks as if his one fixed idea about Laura
was becoming too much for his mind. I will write immediately to some of
my mother's influential old friends in London, and press his claims on
their notice. Change of scene and change of occupation may really be the
salvation of him at this crisis in his life.

<P>Greatly to my relief, Sir Percival sent an apology for not joining us
at breakfast. He had taken an early cup of coffee in his own room, and
he was still engaged there in writing letters. At eleven o'clock, if that
hour was convenient, he would do himself the honour of waiting on Miss
Fairlie and Miss Halcombe.

<P>My eyes were on Laura's face while the message was being delivered.
I had found her unaccountably quiet and composed on going into her room
in the morning, and so she remained all through breakfast. Even when we
were sitting together on the sofa in her room, waiting for Sir Percival,
she still preserved her self-control.

<P>`Don't be afraid of me, Marian,' was all she said; `I may forget myself
with an old friend like Mr Gilmore, or with a dear sister like you, but
I will not forget myself with Sir Percival Glyde.'

<P>I looked at her, and listened to her in silent surprise. Through all
the years of our close intimacy this passive force in her character had
been hidden from me -- hidden even from herself, till love found it, and
suffering called it forth.

<P>As the clock on the mantelpiece struck eleven Sir Percival knocked at
the door and came in. There was suppressed anxiety and agitation in every
line of his face. The dry, sharp cough, which teases him at most times,
seemed to be troubling him more incessantly than ever. He sat down opposite
to us at the table, and Laura remained by me. I looked attentively at them
both, and he was the palest of the two.

<P>He said a few unimportant words, with a visible effort to preserve his
customary ease of manner. But his voice was not to be steadied, and the
restless uneasiness in his eyes was not to be concealed. He must have felt
this himself, for he stopped in the middle of a sentence, and gave up even
the attempt to hide his embarrassment any longer.

<P>There was just one moment of dead silence before Laura addressed him.

<P>`I wish to speak to you, Sir Percival,' she said, `on a subject that
is very important to us both. My sister is here, because her presence helps
me and gives me confidence. She has not suggested one word of what I am
going to say -- I speak from my own thoughts, not from hers. I am sure
you will be kind enough to understand that before I go any farther?'

<P>Sir Percival bowed. She had proceeded thus far, with perfect outward
tranquillity and perfect propriety of manner. She looked at him, and he
looked at her. They seemed, at the outset, at least, resolved to understand
one another plainly.

<P>`I have heard from Marian,' she went on, `that I have only to claim
my release from our engagement to obtain that release from you. It was
forbearing and generous on your part, Sir Percival, to send me such a message-
It is only doing you justice to say that I am grateful for the offer, and
I hope and believe that it is only doing myself justice to tell you that
I decline to accept it.'

<P>His attentive face relaxed a little. But I saw one of his feet, softly,
quietly, incessantly beating on the carpet under the table, and I felt
that he was secretly as anxious as ever.

<P>`l have not forgotten,' she said, `that you asked my father's permission
before you honoured me with a proposal of marriage. Perhaps you have not
forgotten either what I said when I consented to our engagement? I ventured
to tell you that my father's influence and advice had mainly decided me
to give you my promise. I was guided by my father, because I had always
found him the truest of all advisers, the best and fondest of all protectors
and friends. I have lost him now -- I have only his memory to love, but
my faith in that dear dead friend has never been shaken. I believe at this
moment, as truly as I ever believed, that he knew what was best, and that
his hopes and wishes ought to be my hopes and wishes too.'

<P>Her voice trembled for the first time. Her restless fingers stole their
way into my lap, and held fast by one of my hands. There was another moment
of silence, and then Sir Percival spoke.

<P>`May I ask,' he said, `if I have ever proved myself unworthy of the
trust which it has been hitherto my greatest honour and greatest happiness
to possess?'

<P>`I have found nothing in your conduct to blame,' she answered. `You
have always treated me with the same delicacy and the same forbearance.
You have deserved my trust, and, what is of far more importance in my estimation,
you have deserved my father's trust, out of which mine grew. You have given
me no excuse, even if I had wanted to find one, for asking to be released
from my pledge. What I have said so far has been spoken with the wish to
acknowledge my whole obligation to you. My regard for that obligation,
my regard for my father's memory, and my regard for my own promise, all
forbid me to set the example, on my side, of withdrawing from our present
position. The breaking of our engagement must be entirely your wish and
your act, Sir Percival -- not mine.'

<P>The uneasy beating of his foot suddenly stopped, and he leaned forward
eagerly across the table.

<P>`My act?' he said. `What reason can there be on <I>my</I> side for withdrawing?'

<P>I heard her breath quickening -- I felt her hand growing cold. In spite
of what she had said to me when we were alone, I began to be afraid of
her. I was wrong.

<P>`A reason that it is very hard to tell you,' she answered. `There is
a change in me, Sir Percival -- a change which is serious enough to justify
you, to yourself and to me, in breaking off our engagement.'

<P>His face turned so pale again that even his lips lost their colour.
He raised the arm which lay on the table, turned a little away in his chair,
and supported his head on his hand, so that his profile only was presented
to us.

<P>`What change?' he asked. The tone in which he put the question jarred
on me -- there was something painfully suppressed in it.

<P>She sighed heavily, and leaned towards me a little, so as to rest her
shoulder against mine. I felt her trembling, and tried to spare her by
speaking myself. She stopped me by a warning pressure of her hand, and
then addressed Sir Percival once more, but this time without looking at
him.

<P>`I have heard,' she said, `and I believe it, that the fondest and truest
of all affections is the affection which a woman ought to bear to her husband.
When our engagement began that affection was mine to give, if I could,
and yours to win, if you could. Will you pardon me, and spare me, Sir Percival,
if I acknowledge that it is not so any longer?'

<P>A few tears gathered in her eyes, and dropped over her cheeks slowly
as she paused and waited for his answer. He did not utter a word. At the
beginning of his reply he had moved the hand on which his head rested,
so that it hid his face. I saw nothing but the upper part of his figure
at the table. Not a muscle of him moved. The fingers of the hand which
supported his head were dented deep in his hair. They might have expressed
hidden anger or hidden grief -- it was hard to say which -- there was no
significant trembling in them. There was nothing, absolutely nothing, to
tell the secret of his thoughts at that moment -- the moment which was
the crisis of his life and the crisis of hers.

<P>I was determined to make him declare himself, for Laura's sake.

<P>`Sir Percival!' I interposed sharply, `have you nothing to say when
my sister has said so much? More, in my opinion,' I added, my unlucky temper
getting the better of me, `than any man alive, in your position, has a
right to hear from her.'

<P>That last rash sentence opened a way for him by which to escape me if
he chose, and he instantly took advantage of it.

<P>`Pardon me, Miss Halcombe,' he said, still keeping his hand over his
face, `pardon me if I remind you that I have claimed no such right.'

<P>The few plain words which would have brought him back to the point from
which he had wandered were just on my lips, when Laura checked me by speaking
again.

<P>`l hope I have not made my painful acknowledgment in vain,' she continued.
`I hope it has secured me your entire confidence in what I have still to
say?'

<P>`Pray be assured of it.' He made that brief reply warmly, dropping his
hand on the table while he spoke, and turning towards us again. Whatever
outward change had passed over him was gone now. His face was eager and
expectant -- it expressed nothing but the most intense anxiety to hear
her next words.

<P>`I wish you to understand that I have not spoken from any selfish motive,'
she said. `If you leave me, Sir Percival, after what you have just heard,
you do not leave me to marry another man, you only allow me to remain a
single woman for the rest of my life. My fault towards you has begun and
ended in my own thoughts. It can never go any farther. No word has passed
She hesitated. in doubt about the expression she should use next, hesitated
in a momentary confusion which it was very sad and very painful to see.
`No word has passed,' she patiently and resolutely resumed, `between myself
and the person to whom I am now referring for the first and last time in
your presence of my feelings towards him, or of his feelings towards me
-- no word ever can pass -- neither he nor I arc likely, in this world,
to meet again. I earnestly beg you to spare me from saying any more, and
to believe me, on my word, in what I have just told you. It is the truth,
Sir Percival, the truth which <I>I</I> think my promised husband has a
claim to hear, at any sacrifice of my own feelings. I trust to his generosity
to pardon me, and to his honour to keep my secret.'

<P>`Both those trusts are sacred to me,' he said, `and both shall be sacredly
kept.'

<P>After answering in those terms he paused, and looked at her as if he
was waiting to hear more.

<P>`I have said all I wish to say,' she added quietly -- `I have said more
than enough to justify you in withdrawing from your engagement.'

<P>`You have said more than enough,' he answered, `to make it the dearest
object of my life to <I>keep</I> the engagement.' With those words he rose
from his chair, and advanced a few steps towards the place where she was
sitting.

<P>She started violently, and a faint cry of surprise escaped her. Every
word she had spoken had innocently betrayed her purity and truth to a man
who thoroughly understood the priceless value of a pure and true woman.
Her own noble conduct had been the hidden enemy, throughout, of all the
hopes she had trusted to it. I had dreaded this from the first. I would
have prevented it. if she had allowed me the smallest chance of doing so.
I even waited and watched now, when the harm was done. for a word from
Sir Percival that would give me the opportunity of putting him in the wrong.

<P>`You have left it to <I>me</I>, Miss Fairlie. to resign you,' he continued.
`I am not heartless enough to resign a woman who has just shown herself
to be the noblest of her sex.'

<P>He spoke with such warmth and feeling, with such passionate enthusiasm,
and yet with such perfect delicacy, that she raised her head, flushed up
a little, and looked at him with sudden animation and spirit.

<P>`No!' she said firmly. `The most wretched of her sex, if she must give
herself in marriage when she cannot give her love.'

<P>`May she not give it in the future,' he asked, `if the one object of
her husband's life is to deserve it?'

<P>`Never!' she answered. `If you still persist in maintaining our engagement,
I may be your true and faithful wife, Sir Percival -- your loving wife,
if I know my own heart, never!'

<P>She looked so irresistibly beautiful as she said those brave words that
no man alive could have steeled his heart against her. I tried hard to
feel that Sir Percival was to blame, and to say so, but my womanhood would
pity him, in spite of myself.

<P>`I gratefully accept your faith and truth,' he said. `The least that
you can offer is more to me than the utmost that I could hope for from
any other woman in the world.'

<P>Her left hand still held mine, but her right hand hung listlessly at
her side. He raised it gently to his lips -- touched it with them, rather
than kissed it -- bowed to me -- and then, with perfect delicacy and discretion,
silently quitted the room.

<P>She neither moved nor said a word when he was gone -- she sat by me,
cold and still, with her eyes fixed on the ground. I saw it was hopeless
and useless to speak, and I only put my arm round her, and held her to
me in silence. We remained together so for what seemed a long and weary
time -- so long and so weary, that I grew uneasy and spoke to her softly,
in the hope of producing a change.

<P>The sound of my voice seemed to startle her into consciousness. She
suddenly drew herself away from me and rose to her feet.

<P>`I must submit, Marian, as well as I can,' she said. `My new life has
its hard duties, and one of them begins today.'

<P>As she spoke she went to a side-table near the window, on which her
sketching materials were placed, gathered them together carefully, and
put them in a drawer of her cabinet. She locked the drawer and brought
the key to me.

<P>`I must part from everything that reminds me of him,' she said. `Keep
the key wherever you please -- I shall never want it again.'

<P>Before I could say a word she had turned away to her bookcase, and had
taken from it the album that contained Walter Hartright's drawings. She
hesitated for a moment, holding the little volume fondly in her hands --
then lifted it to her lips and kissed it.

<P>`Oh, Laura! Laura!' I said, not angrily, not reprovingly -- with nothing
but sorrow in my voice, and nothing but sorrow in my heart.

<P>`It is the last time, Marian,' she pleaded. `I am bidding it good-bye
for ever.'

<P>She laid the book on the table and drew out the comb that fastened her
hair. It fell, in its matchless beauty, over her back and shoulders, and
dropped round her, far below her waist. She separated one long, thin lock
from the rest, cut it off, and pinned it carefully, in the form of a circle,
on the first blank page of the album. The moment it was fastened she closed
the volume hurriedly, and placed it in my hands.

<P>`You write to him and he writes to you,' she said. `While I am alive,
if he asks after me always tell him I am well, and never say I am unhappy.
Don't distress him, Marian, for <I>my</I> sake, don't distress him. If
I die first, promise you will give him this little book of his drawings,
with my hair in it. There can be no harm, when I am gone, in telling him
that I put it there with my own hands. And say -- oh, Marian, say for me,
then, what I can never say for myself -- say I loved him!'

<P>She flung her arms round my neck, and whispered the last words in my
ear with a passionate delight in uttering them which it almost broke my
heart to hear. All the long restraint she had imposed on herself gave way
in that first last outburst of tenderness. She broke from me with hysterical
vehemence, and threw herself on the sofa in a paroxysm of sobs and tears
that shook her from head to foot.

<P>I tried vainly to soothe her and reason with her -- she was past being
soothed, and past being reasoned with. It was the sad, sudden end for us
two of this memorable day. When the fit had worn itself Out she was too
exhausted to speak. She slumbered towards the afternoon, and I Put away
the book of drawings so that she might not see it when she woke. My face
was calm, whatever my heart might be, when she opened her eyes again and
looked at me. We said no more to each other about the distressing interview
of the morning. Sir Percival's name was not mentioned. Walter Hartright
was not alluded to again by either of us for the remainder of the day.

<P>10th. -- Finding that she was composed and like herself this morning,
I returned to the painful subject of yesterday, for the sole purpose of
imploring her to let me speak to Sir Percival and Mr Fairlie, more plainly
and strongly than she could speak to either of them herself, about this
lamentable marriage. She interposed, gently but firmly, in the middle of
my remonstrances.

<P>`I left yesterday to decide,' she said; `and yesterday <I>has</I> decided.
It is too late to go back.'

<P>Sir Percival spoke to me this afternoon about what had passed in Laura's
room. He assured me that the unparalleled trust she had placed in him had
awakened such an answering conviction of her innocence and integrity in
his mind, that he was guiltless of having felt even a moment's unworthy
jealousy, either at the time when he was in her presence, or afterwards
when he had withdrawn from it. Deeply as he lamented the unfortunate attachment
which had hindered the progress he might otherwise have made in her esteem
and regard, he firmly believed that it had remained unacknowledged in the
past, and that it would remain, under all changes of circumstance which
it was possible to contemplate, unacknowledged in the future. This was
his absolute conviction; and the strongest proof he could give of it was
the assurance, which he now offered, that he felt no curiosity to know
whether the attachment was of recent date or not, or who had been the object
of it. His implicit confidence in Miss Fairlie made him satisfied with
what she had thought fit to say to him, and he was honestly innocent of
the slightest feeling of anxiety to hear more.

<P>He waited after saying those words and looked at me. I was so conscious
of my unreasonable prejudice against him -- so conscious of an unworthy
suspicion that he might be speculating on my impulsively answering the
very questions which he had just described himself as resolved not to ask
-- that I evaded all reference to this part of the subject with something
like a feeling of confusion on my own part. At the same time I was resolved
not to lose even the smallest opportunity of trying to plead Laura's cause,
and I told him boldly that I regretted his generosity had not carried him
one step farther, and induced him to withdraw from the engagement altogether.

<P>Here, again, he disarmed me by not attempting to defend himself. He
would merely beg me to remember the difference there was between his allowing
Miss Fairlie to give him up, which was a matter of submission only, and
his forcing himself to give up Miss Fairlie, which was, in other words,
asking him to be the suicide of his own hopes. Her conduct of the day before
had so strengthened the unchangeable love and admiration of two long years,
that all active contention against those feelings, on his part, was henceforth
entirely out of his power. I must think him weak, selfish, unfeeling towards
the very woman whom he idolised, and he must bow to my opinion as resignedly
as he could -- only putting it to me, at the same time, whether her future
as a single woman, pining under an unhappily placed attachment which she
could never acknowledge, could be said to promise her a much brighter prospect
than her future as the wife of a man who worshipped the very ground she
walked on? In the last case there was hope from time, however slight it
might be -- in the first case, on her own showing, there was no hope at
all.

<P>I answered him -- more because my tongue is a woman's, and must answer,
than because I had anything convincing to say. It was only too plain that
the course Laura had adopted the day before had offered him the advantage
if he chose to take it -- and that he <I>had</I> chosen to take it. I felt
this at the time, and I feel it just as strongly now, while I write these
lines, in my own room. The one hope left is that his motives really spring,
as he says they do, from the irresistible strength of his attachment to
Laura.

<P>Before I close my diary for tonight I must record that I wrote today,
in poor Hartright's interest, to two of my mother's old friends in London
-- both men of influence and position. If they can do anything for him,
I am quite sure they will. Except Laura, I never was more anxious about
anyone than I am now about Walter. All that has happened since he left
us has only increased my strong regard and sympathy for him. I hope I am
doing right in trying to help him to employment abroad -- I hope, most
earnestly and anxiously, that it will end well.

<P>11th. -- Sir Percival had an interview with Mr Fairlie, and I was sent
for to join them.

<P>I found Mr Fairlie greatly relieved at the prospect of the `family worry'
(as he was pleased to describe his niece's marriage) being settled at last.
So far, I did not feel called on to say anything to him about my own opinion,
but when he proceeded, in his most aggravatingly languid manner, to suggest
that the time for the marriage had better be settled next, in accordance
with Sir Percival's wishes, I enjoyed the satisfaction of assailing Mr
Fairlie's nerves with as strong a protest against hurrying Laura's decision
as I could put into words. Sir Percival immediately assured me that he
felt the force of my objection, and begged me to believe that the proposal
had not been made in consequence of any interference on his part. Mr Fairlie
leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, said we both of us did honour
to human nature, and then repeated his suggestion as coolly as if neither
Sir Percival nor I had said a word in opposition to it. It ended in my
flatly declining to mention the subject to Laura, unless she first approached
it of her own accord. I left the room at once after making that declaration.
Sir Percival looked seriously embarrassed and distressed, Mr Fairlie stretched
out his lazy legs on his velvet footstool, and said, `Dear Marian! how
I envy you your robust nervous system! Don't bang the door!'

<P>On going to Laura's room I found that she had asked for me, and that
Mrs Vesey had informed her that I was with Mr Fairlie. She inquired at
once what I had been wanted for, and I told her all that had passed, without
attempting to conceal the vexation and annoyance that I really felt. Her
answer surprised and distressed me inexpressibly -- it was the very last
reply that I should have expected her to make.

<P>`My uncle is right,' she said. `I have caused trouble and anxiety enough
to you, and to all about me. Let me cause no more, Marian -- let Sir Percival
decide.'

<P>I remonstrated warmly, but nothing that I could say moved her.

<P>`I am held to my engagement,' she replied; `I have broken with my old
life. The evil day will not come the less surely because I put it off.
No, Marian! once again my uncle is right. I have caused trouble enough
and anxiety enough, and I will cause no more.'

<P>She used to be pliability itself, but she was now inflexibly passive
in her resignation -- I might almost say in her despair. Dearly as I love
her, I should have been less pained if she had been violently agitated
-- it was so shockingly unlike her natural character to see her cold and
insensible as I saw her now.

<P>12th. -- Sir Percival put some questions to me at breakfast about Laura,
which left me no choice but to tell him what she had said.

<P>While we were talking she herself came down and joined us. She was just
as unnaturally comPosed in Sir Percival's presence as she had been in mine.
When breakfast was over he had an opportunity of saying a few words to
her privately, in a recess of one of the windows. They were not more than
two or three minutes together, and on their separating she left the room
with Mrs Vesey, while Sir Percival came to me. He said he had entreated
her to favour him by maintaining her privilege of fixing the time for the
marriage at her own will and pleasure. In reply she had merely expressed
her acknowledgments, and had desired him to mention what his wishes were
to Miss Halcombe.

<P>I have no patience to write more. In this instance, as in every other,
Sir Percival has carried his point with the utmost possible credit to himself,
in spite of everything that I can say or do. His wishes are now, what they
were, of course, when he first came here; and Laura having resigned herself
to the one inevitable sacrifice of the marriage, remains as coldly hopeless
and enduring as ever. In parting with the little occupations and relics
that reminded her of Hartright, she seems to have parted with all her tenderness
and all her impressibility. It is only three o'clock in the afternoon while
I write these lines, and Sir Percival has left us already, in the happy
hurry of a bridegroom, to prepare for the bride's reception at his house
in Hampshire. Unless some extraordinary event happens to prevent it they
will be married exactly at the time when he wished to be married -- before
the end of the year. My very fingers burn as I write it!

<P>13th. -- A sleepless night, through uneasiness about Laura. Towards
the morning I came to a resolution to try what change of scene would do
to rouse her. She cannot surely remain in her present torpor of insensibility,
if I take her away from Limmeridge and surround her with the pleasant faces
of old friends? After some consideration I decided on writing to the Arnolds,
in Yorkshire. They are simple, kind-hearted, hospitable people, and she
has known them from her childhood. When I had put the letter in the post-bag
I told her what I had done. It would have been a relief to me if she had
shown the spirit to resist and object. But no -- she only said, `I will
go anywhere with you, Marian. I dare say you are right -- I dare say the
change will do me good.'

<P>14th. -- I wrote to Mr Gilmore, informing him that there was really
a prospect of this miserable marriage taking place, and also mentioning
my idea of trying what change of scene would do for Laura. I had no heart
to go into particulars. Time enough for them when we get nearer to the
end of the year.

<P>15th. -- Three letters for me. The first, from the Arnolds, full of
delight at the prospect of seeing Laura and me. The second, from one of
the gentlemen to whom I wrote on Walter Hartright's behalf, informing me
that he has been fortunate enough to find an opportunity of complying with
my request. The third, from Walter himself, thanking me, poor fellow, in
the warmest terms, for giving him an opportunity of leaving his home, his
country, and his friends. A private expedition to make excavations among
the ruined cities of Central America is, it seems, about to sail from Liverpool.
The draughtsman who had been already appointed to accompany it has lost
heart, and withdrawn at the eleventh hour, and Walter is to fill his place.
He is to be engaged for six months certain, from the time of the landing
in Honduras, and for a year afterwards, if the excavations are successful,
and if the funds hold out. His letter ends with a promise to write me a
farewell line when they are all on board ship, and when the pilot leaves
them. I can only hope and pray earnestly that he and I are both acting
in this matter for the best. It seems of it startles me. And yet, in his
unhappy position, how can I expect him or wish him to remain at home?

<P>16th. -- The carriage is at the door. Laura and I set out on our visit
to the Arnolds today.

<CENTER>POLESDEAN LODGE, YORKSHIRE.</CENTER>


<P>23rd. -- A week in these new scenes and among these kind-hearted people
has done her some good, though not so much as I had hoped. I have resolved
to prolong our stay for another week at least. It is useless to go back
to Limmeridge till there is an absolute necessity for our return.

<P>24th. -- Sad news by this morning's post. The expedition to Central
America sailed on the twenty-first. We have parted with a true man -- we
have lost a faithful friend. Walter Hartright has left England.

<P>25th. -- Sad news yesterday -- ominous news today. Sir Percival Glyde
has written to Mr Fairlie, and Mr Fairlie has written to Laura and me,
to recall us to Limmeridge immediately.

<P>What can this mean? Has the day for the marriage been fixed in our absence?
