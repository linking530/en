PART THE SECOND</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H2>
THE STORY CONTINUED BY WALTER HARTRIGHT</H2></CENTER>
I OPEN a new page. I advance my narrative by one week.

<P>The history of the interval which I thus pass over must remain unrecorded.
My heart turns faint, my mind sinks in darkness and confusion when I think
of it. This must not be, if I who write am to guide, as I ought, you who
read. This must not be, if the clue that leads through the windings of
the story is to remain from end to end untangled in my hands.

<P>A life suddenly changed -- its whole purpose created afresh, its hopes
and fears, its struggles, its interests, and its sacrifices all turned
at once and for ever into a new direction -- this is the prospect which
now opens before me, like the burst of view from a mountain's top. I left
my narrative in the quiet shadow of Limmeridge church -- I resume it, one
week later, in the stir and turmoil of a London street.

<P>The street is in a populous and a poor neighbourhood. The ground floor
of one of the houses in it is occupied by a small news-vendor's shop, and
the first floor and the second are let as furnished lodgings of the humblest
kind.

<P>I have taken those two floors in an assumed name. On the upper floor
I live, with a room to work in, a room to sleep in. On the lower floor,
under the same assumed name, two women live, who are described as my sisters.
I get my bread by drawing and engraving on wood for the cheap periodicals.
My sisters are sup posed to help me by taking in a little needlework. Our
poor place of abode, our humble calling, our assumed relationship, and
our assumed name, are all used alike as a means of hiding us in the house-forest
of London. We are numbered no longer with the people whose lives are open
and known. I am an obscure, unnoticed man, without patron or friend to
help me. Marian Halcombe is nothing now but my eldest sister, who provides
for our household wants by the toil of her own hands. We two, in the estimation
of others, are at once the dupes and the agents of a daring imposture.
We are supposed to be the accomplices of mad Anne Catherick, who claims
the name, the Place, and the living personality of dead Lady Glyde.

<P>That is our situation. That is the changed aspect in which we three
must appear, henceforth, in this narrative, for many and many a page to
come.

<P>In the eye of reason and of law, in the estimation of relatives and
friends, according to every received formality of civilised society, `Laura,
Lady Glyde,' lay buried with her mother in Limmeridge churchyard. Torn
in her own lifetime from the list of the living, the daughter of Philip
Fairlie and the wife of Percival Glyde might still exist for her sister,
might still exist for me, but to all the world besides she was dead. Dead
to her uncle, who had renounced her; dead to the servants of the house,
who had failed to recognise her; dead to the persons in authority, who
had transmitted her fortune to her husband and her aunt; dead to my mother
and my sister, who believed me to be the dupe of an adventuress and the
victim of a fraud; socially, morally, legally -- dead.

<P>And yet alive! Alive in poverty and in hiding. Alive, with the poor
drawing-master to fight her battle, and to win the way back for her to
her place in the world of living beings.

<P>Did no suspicion, excited by my own knowledge of Anne Catherick's resemblance
to her, cross my mind, when her face was first revealed to me? Not the
shadow of a suspicion, from the moment when she lifted her veil by the
side of the inscription which recorded her death.

<P>Before the sun of that day had set, before the last glimpse of the home
which was closed against her had passed from our view, the farewell words
I spoke, when we parted at Limmeridge House, had been recalled by both
of us -- repeated by me, recognised by her. `If ever the time comes, when
the devotion of my whole heart and soul and strength will give you a moment's
happiness, or spare you a moment's sorrow, will you try to remember the
poor drawing-master who has taught you?' She, who now remembered so little
of the trouble and terror of a later time, remembered those words, and
laid her poor head innocently and trustingly on the bosom of the man who
had spoken them. In that moment, when she called me by my name, when she
said, `They have tried to make me forget everything, Walter, but I remember
Marian, and I remember you' -- in that moment, I, who had long since given
her my love, gave her my life, and thanked God that it was mine to bestow
on her. Yes! the time had come, from thousands on thousands of miles away
-- through forest and wilderness, where companions stronger than I had
fallen by my side, through peril of death thrice renewed, and thrice escaped,
the Hand that leads men on the dark road to the future had led me to meet
that time. Forlorn and disowned, sorely tried and sadly changed -- her
Beauty faded, her mind clouded -- robbed of her station in the world, of
her place among living creatures -- the devotion I had promised, the devotion
of my whole heart and soul and strength, might be laid blamelessly now
at those dear feet. In the right of her calamity, in the right of her friendlessness,
she was mine at last! Mine to support, to protect, to cherish, to restore.
Mine to love and honour as father and brother both. Mine to vindicate through
all risks and all sacrifices -- through the hopeless struggle against Rank
and Power, through the long fight with armed deceit and fortified Success,
through the waste of my reputation, through the loss of my friends, through
the hazard of my life.
<CENTER>
<H2>
II</H2></CENTER>
My position is defined -- my motives are acknowledged. The story of Marian
and the story of Laura must come next.

<P>I shall relate both narratives, not in the words (often interrupted,
often inevitably confused) of the speakers themselves, but in the words
of the brief, plain, studiously simple abstract which I committed to writing
for my own guidance, and for the guidance of my legal adviser. So the tangled
web will be most speedily and most intelligibly unrolled.

<P>The story of Marian begins where the narrative of the housekeeper at
Blackwater Park left off.

<P>On Lady Glyde's departure from her husband's house, the fact of that
departure, and the necessary statement of the circumstances under which
it had taken place, were communicated to Miss Halcombe by the housekeeper.
It was not till some days afterwards (how many days exactly, Mrs Michelson,
in the absence of any written memorandum on the subject, could not undertake
to say) that a letter arrived from Madame Fosco announcing Lady Glyde's
sudden death in Count Fosco's house. The letter avoided mentioning dates,
and left it to Mrs Michelson's discretion to break the news at once to
Miss Halcombe, or to defer doing so until that lady's health should be
more firmly established.

<P>Having consulted Mr Dawson (who had been himself delayed, by ill health,
in resuming his attendance at Blackwater Park), Mrs Michelson, by the doctor's
advice, and in the doctor's presence, communicated the news, either on
the day when the letter was received, or on the day after. It is not necessary
to dwell here upon the effect which the intelligence of Lady Glyde's sudden
death produced on her sister. It is only useful to the present purpose
to say that she was not able to travel for more than three weeks afterwards.
At the end of that time she proceeded to London accompanied by the housekeeper.
They parted there -- Mrs Michelson previously informing Miss Halcombe of
her address, in case they might wish to communicate at a future period.

<P>On parting with the housekeeper Miss Halcombe went at once to the office
of Messrs Gilmore &amp; Kyrle to consult with the latter gentleman in Mr
Gilmore's absence. She mentioned to Mr Kyrle what she had thought it desirable
to conceal from every one else (Mrs Michelson included) -- her suspicion
of the circumstances under which Lady Glyde was said to have met her death.
Mr Kyrle, who had previously given friendly proof of his anxiety to serve
Miss Halcombe, at once undertook to make such inquiries as the delicate
and dangerous nature of the investigation proposed to him would permit.

<P>To exhaust this part of the subject before going farther, it may be
mentioned that Count Fosco offered every facility to Mr Kyrle, on that
gentleman's stating that he was sent by Miss Halcombe to collect such particulars
as had not yet reached her of Lady Glyde's decease. Mr Kyrle was placed
in communication with the medical man, Mr Goodricke, and with the two servants.
In the absence of any means of ascertaining the exact date of Lady Glyde's
departure from Blackwater Park, the result of the doctor's and the servants'
evidence, and of the volunteered statements of Count Fosco and his wife,
was conclusive to the mind of Mr Kyrle. He could only assume that the intensity
of Miss Halcombe's suffering, under the loss of her sister, had misled
her judgment in a most deplorable manner, and he wrote her word that the
shocking suspicion to which she had alluded in his presence was, in his
opinion, destitute of the smallest fragment of foundation in truth. Thus
the investigation by Mr Gilmore's partner began and ended.

<P>Meanwhile, Miss Halcombe had returned to Limmeridge House, and had there
collected all the additional information which she was able to obtain.

<P>Mr Fairlie had received his first intimation of his niece's death from
his sister, Madame Fosco, this letter also not containing any exact reference
to dates. He had sanctioned his sister's proposal that the deceased lady
should be laid in her mother's grave in Limmeridge churchyard. Count Fosco
had accompanied the remains to Cumberland, and had attended the funeral
at Limmeridge, which took place on the 30th of July. It was followed, as
a mark of respect, by all the inhabitants of the village and the neighbourhood.
On the next day the inscription (originally drawn out, it was said, by
the aunt of the deceased lady, and submitted for approval to her brother,
Mr Fairlie) was engraved on one side of the monument over the tomb.

<P>On the day of the funeral, and for one day after it, Count Fosco had
been received as a guest at Limmeridge House, but no interview had taken
place between Mr Fairlie and himself, by the former gentleman's desire.
They had communicated by writing, and through this medium Count Fosco had
made Mr Fairlie acquainted with the details of his niece's last illness
and death. The letter presenting this information added no new facts to
the facts already known, but one very remarkable paragraph was contained
in the postscript. It referred to Anne Catherick.

<P>The substance of the paragraph in question was as follows --

<P>It first informed Mr Fairlie that Anne Catherick (of whom he might hear
full particulars from Miss Halcombe when she reached Limmeridge) had been
traced and recovered in the neighbourhood of Blackwater Park, and had been
for the second time placed under the charge of the medical man from whose
custody she had once escaped.

<P>This was the first part of the postscript. The second part warned Mr
Fairlie that Anne Catherick's mental malady had been aggravated by her
long freedom from control, and that the insane hatred and distrust of Sir
Percival Glyde, which had been one of her most marked delusions in former
times, still existed under a newly-acquired form. The unfortunate woman's
last idea in connection with Sir Percival was the idea of annoying and
distressing him, and of elevating herself, as she supposed, in the estimation
of the patients and nurses, by assuming the character of his deceased wife,
the scheme of this personation having evidently occurred to her after a
stolen interview which she had succeeded in obtaining with Lady Glyde,
and at which she had observed the extraordinary accidental likeness between
the deceased lady and herself. It was to the last degree improbable that
she would succeed a second time in escaping from the Asylum, but it was
just possible she might find some means of annoying the late Lady Glyde's
relatives with letters, and in that case Mr Fairlie was warned beforehand
how to receive them.

<P>The postscript, expressed in these terms, was shown to Miss Halcombe
when she arrived at Limmeridge. There were also placed in her possession
the clothes Lady Glyde had worn, and the other effects she had brought
with her to her aunt's house. They had been carefully collected and sent
to Cumberland by Madame Fosco.

<P>Such was the posture of affairs when Miss Halcombe reached Limmeridge
in the early part of September.

<P>Shortly afterwards she was confined to her room by a relapse, her weakened
physical energies giving way under the severe mental affliction from which
she was now suffering. On getting stronger again, in a month's time, her
suspicion of the circumstances described as attending her sister's death
still remained unshaken. She had heard nothing in the interim of Sir Percival
Glyde, but letters had reached her from Madame Fosco, making the most affectionate
inquiries on the part of her husband and herself. Instead of answering
these letters, Miss Halcombe caused the house in St John's Wood, and the
proceedings of its inmates, to be privately watched.

<P>Nothing doubtful was discovered. The same result attended the next investigations,
which were secretly instituted on the subject of Mrs Rubelle. She had arrived
in London about six months before with her husband. They had come from
Lyons, and they had taken a house in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square,
to be fitted up as a boarding-house for foreigners, who were expected to
visit England in large numbers to see the Exhibition of 1851. Nothing was
known against husband or wife in the neighbourhood. They were quiet people,
and they had paid their way honestly up to the present time. The final
inquiries related to Sir Percival Glyde. He was settled in Paris, and living
there quietly in a small circle of English and French friends.

<P>Foiled at all points, but still not able to rest, Miss Halcombe next
determined to visit the Asylum in which she then supposed Anne Catherick
to be for the second time confined. She had felt a strong curiosity about
the woman in former days, and she was now doubly interested -- first, in
ascertaining whether the report of Anne Catherick's attempted personation
of Lady Glyde was true, and secondly (if it proved to be true), in discovering
for herself what the poor creature's real motives were for attempting the
deceit.

<P>Although Count Fosco's letter to Mr Fairlie did not mention the address
of the Asylum, that important omission cast no difficulties in Miss Halcombe's
way. When Mr Hartright had met Anne Catherick at Limmeridge, she had informed
him of the locality in which the house was situated, and Miss Halcombe
had noted down the direction in her diary, with all the other particulars
of the interview exactly as she heard them from Mr Hartright's own lips.
Accordingly she looked back at the entry and extracted the address -- furnished
herself with the Count's letter to Mr Fairlie as a species of credential
which might be useful to her, and started by herself for the Asylum on
the eleventh of October.

<P>She passed the night of the eleventh in London. It had been her intention
to sleep at the house inhabited by Lady Glyde's old governess, but Mrs
Vesey's agitation at the sight of her lost pupil's nearest and dearest
friend was so distressing that Miss Halcombe considerately refrained from
remaining in her presence, and removed to a respectable boarding-house
in the neighbourhood, recommended by Mrs Vesey's married sister. The next
day she proceeded to the Asylum, which was situated not far from London
on the northern side of the metropolis.

<P>She was immediately admitted to see the proprietor.

<P>At first he appeared to be decidedly unwilling to let her communicate
with his patient. But on her showing him the postscript to Count Fosco's
letter -- on her reminding him that she was the `Miss Halcombe' there referred
to -- that she was a near relative of the deceased Lady Glyde -- and that
she was therefore naturally interested, for family reasons, in observing
for herself the extent of Anne Catherick's delusion in relation to her
late sister -- the tone and manner of the owner of the Asylum altered,
and he withdrew his objections. He probably felt that a continued refusal,
under these circumstances, would not only be an act of discourtesy in itself,
but would also imply that the proceedings in his establishment were not
of a nature to bear investigation by respectable strangers.

<P>Miss Halcombe's own impression was that the owner of the Asylum had
not been received into the confidence of Sir Percival and the Count. His
consenting at all to let her visit his patient seemed to afford one proof
of this, and his readiness in making admissions which could scarcely have
escaped the lips of an accomplice. certainly appeared so furnish another.

<P>For example, in the course of the introductory conversation which took
place, he informed Miss Halcombe that Anne Catherick had been brought back
to him with the necessary order and certificates by Count Fosco on the
twenty-seventh of July -- the Count also producing a letter of explanations
and instructions signed by Sir Percival Glyde. On receiving his inmate
again, the proprietor of the Asylum acknowledged that he had observed some
curious personal changes in her. Such changes no doubt were not without
precedent in his experience of persons mentally afflicted. Insane people
were often at one time, outwardly as well as inwardly, unlike what they
were at another -- the change from better to worse, or from worse to better,
in the madness having a necessary tendency to produce alterations of appearance
externally. He allowed for these, and he allowed also for the modification
in the form of Anne Catherick's delusion, which was reflected no doubt
in her manner and expression. But he was still perplexed at times by certain
differences between his patient before she had escaped and his patient
since she had been brought back. Those differences were too minute to be
described. He could not Say of course that she was absolutely altered in
height or shape or complexion, or in the colour of her hair and eyes, or
in the general form of her face -- the change was something that he felt
more than something that he saw. In short, the case had been a puzzle from
the first, and one more perplexity was added to it now.

<P>It cannot be said that this conversation led to the result of even partially
preparing Miss Halcombe's mind for what was to come. But it produced, nevertheless,
a very serious effect upon her. She was so completely unnerved by it, that
some little time elapsed before she could summon composure enough to follow
the proprietor of the Asylum to that part of the house in which the inmates
were confined.

<P>On inquiry, it turned out that the supposed Anne Catherick was then
taking exercise in the grounds attached to the establishment. One of the
nurses volunteered to conduct Miss Halcombe to the place, the proprietor
of the Asylum remaining in the house for a few minutes to attend to a case
which required his services, and then engaging to join his visitor in the
grounds.

<P>The nurse led Miss Halcombe to a distant part of the property, which
was prettily laid out, and after looking about her a little, turned into
a turf walk, shaded by a shrubbery on either side. About half-way down
this walk two women were slowly approaching. The nurse pointed to them
and said, `There is Anne Catherick, ma'am, with the attendant who waits
on her. The attendant will answer any questions you wish to put.' With
those words the nurse left her to return to the duties of the house.

<P>Miss Halcombe advanced on her side, and the women advanced on theirs.
When they were within a dozen paces of each other, one of the women stopped
for an instant, looked eagerly at the strange lady, shook off the nurse's
grasp on her, and the next moment rushed into Miss Halcombe's arms. In
that moment Miss Halcombe recognised her sister -- recognised the dead-alive.

<P>Fortunately for the success of the measures taken subsequently, no one
was present at that moment but the nurse. She was a young woman, and she
was so startled that she was at first quite incapable of interfering. When
she was able to do so her whole services were required by Miss Halcombe,
who had for the moment sunk altogether in the effort to keep her own senses
under the shock of the discovery. After waiting a few minutes in the fresh
air and the cool shade, her natural energy and courage helped her a little,
and she became sufficiently mistress of herself to feel the necessity of
recalling her presence of mind for her unfortunate sister's sake.

<P>She obtained permission to speak alone with the patient, on condition
that they both remained well within the nurse's view. There was no time
for questions -- there was only time for Miss Halcombe to impress on the
unhappy lady the necessity of controlling herself, and to assure her of
immediate help and rescue if she did so. The prospect of escaping from
the Asylum by obedience to her sister's directions was sufficient to quiet
Lady Glyde, and to make her understand what was required of her. Miss Halcombe
next returned to the nurse, placed all the gold she then had in her pocket
(three sovereigns) in the nurse's hands, and asked when and where she could
speak to her alone.

<P>The woman was at first surprised and distrustful. But on Miss Halcombe's
declaring that she only wanted to put some questions which she was too
much agitated to ask at that moment, and that she had no intention of misleading
the nurse into any dereliction of duty, the woman took the money, and proposed
three o'clock on the next day as the time for the interview. She might
then slip out for half an hour, after the patients had dined, and she would
meet the lady in a retired place, outside the high north wall which screened
the grounds of the house. Miss Halcombe had only time to assent, and to
whisper to her sister that she should hear from her on the next day, when
the proprietor of the Asylum joined them. He noticed his visitor's agitation,
which Miss Halcombe accounted for by saying that her interview with Anne
Catherick had a little startled her at first. She took her leave as soon
after as possible -- that is to say, as soon as she could summon courage
to force herself from the presence of her unfortunate sister.

<P>A very little reflection, when the capacity to reflect returned, convinced
her that any attempt to identify Lady Glyde and to rescue her by legal
means, would, even if successful, involve a delay that might be fatal to
her sister's intellects, which were shaken already by the horror of the
situation to which she had been consigned. By the time Miss Halcombe had
got back to London, she had determined to effect Lady Glyde's escape privately,
by means of the nurse.

<P>She went at once to her stockbroker, and sold out of the funds all the
little property she possessed, amounting to rather less than seven hundred
pounds. Determined, if necessary, to pay the price of her sister's liberty
with every farthing she had in the world, she repaired the next day, having
the whole sum about her in bank-notes, to her appointment outside the Asylum
wall.

<P>The nurse was there. Miss Halcombe approached the subject cautiously
by many preliminary questions. She discovered, among other particulars,
that the nurse who had in former times attended on the true Anne Catherick
had been held responsible (although she was not to blame for it) for the
patient's escape, and had lost her place in consequence. The same penalty,
it was added, would attach to the person then speaking to her, if the supposed
Anne Catherick was missing a second time; and, moreover, the nurse in this
case had an especial interest in keeping her place. She was engaged to
be married, and she and her future husband were waiting till they could
save, together, between two and three hundred pounds to start in business.
The nurse's wages were good, and she might succeed, by strict economy,
in contributing her small share towards the sum required in two years'
time.

<P>On this hint Miss Halcombe spoke. She declared that the supposed Anne
Catherick was nearly related to her, that she had been placed in the Asylum
under a fatal mistake, and that the nurse would be doing a good and a Christian
action in being the means of restoring them to one another. Before there
was time to start a single objection, Miss Halcombe took four banknotes
of a hundred pounds each from her pocket-book, and offered them to the
woman. as a compensation for the risk she was to run, and for the loss
of her place.

<P>The nurse hesitated, through sheer incredulity and surprise. Miss Halcombe
pressed the point on her firmly.

<P>`You will be doing a good action,`she repeated; `you will be helping
the most injured and unhappy woman alive. There is your marriage portion
for a reward. Bring her safely to me here, and I will put these four bank-notes
into your hand before I claim her.'

<P>`Will you give me a letter saying those words, which I can show to my
sweetheart when he asks how I got the money?' inquired the woman.

<P>`I will bring the letter with me, ready written and signed,' answered
Miss Halcombe.

<P>`Then I'll risk it,' said the nurse.

<P>`When?'

<P>`Tomorrow.'

<P>It was hastily agreed between them that Miss Halcombe should return
early the next morning and wait out of sight among the trees -- always,
however, keeping near the quiet spot of ground under the north wall. The
nurse could fix no time for her appearance, caution requiring that she
should wait and be guided by circumstances. On that understanding they
separated.

<P>Miss Halcombe was at her place, with the promised letter and the promised
bank-notes, before ten the next morning. She waited more than an hour and
a half. At the end of that time the nurse came quickly round the corner
of the wall holding Lady Glyde by the arm. The moment they met Miss Halcombe
put the bank-notes and the letter into her hand, and the sisters were united
again.

<P>The nurse had dressed Lady Glyde, with excellent forethought, in a bonnet,
veil, and shawl of her own. Miss Halcombe only detained her to suggest
a means of turning the pursuit in a false direction, when the escape was
discovered at the Asylum. She was to go back to the house, to mention in
the hearing of the other nurses that Anne Catherick had been inquiring
latterly about the distance from London to Hampshire. to wait till the
last moment, before discovery was inevitable, and then to give the alarm
that Anne was missing. The supposed inquiries about Hampshire, when communicated
to the owner of the Asylum, would lead him to imagine that his patient
had returned to Blackwater Park, under the influence of the delusion which
made her persist in asserting herself to be Lady Glyde, and the first pursuit
would, in all probability, be turned in that direction.

<P>The nurse consented to follow these suggestions, the more readily as
they offered her the means of securing herself against any worse consequences
than the loss of her place, by remaining in the Asylum, and so maintaining
the appearance of innocence, at least. She at once returned to the house,
and Miss Halcombe lost no time in taking her sister back with her to London.
They caught the afternoon train to Carlisle the same afternoon, and arrived
at Limmeridge, without accident or difficulty of any kind, that night.

<P>During the latter part of their journey they were alone in the carriage,
and Miss Halcombe was able to collect such remembrances of the past as
her sister's confused and weakened memory was able to recall. The terrible
story of the conspiracy so obtained was presented in fragments, sadly incoherent
in themselves, and widely detached from each other. Imperfect as the revelation
was, it must nevertheless be recorded here before this explanatory narrative
closes with the events of the next day at Limmeridge House.
