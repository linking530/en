Chapter 36</H1></CENTER>
But you must excuse one thing -- you must excuse my beginning, Mr Hartright,
with an expression of surprise at the interest which you appear to have
felt in my late daughter. It is quite unaccountable to me. If that interest
makes you anxious for any particulars of her early life, I must refer you
to Mrs Clements, who knows more of the subject than I do. Pray understand
that I do not profess to have been at all over-fond of my late daughter.
She was a worry to me from first to last, with the additional disadvantage
of being always weak in the head. You like candour, and I hope this satisfies
you.

<P>There is no need to trouble you with many personal particulars relating
to those Past times. It will be enough to say that I observed the terms
of the bargain on my side, and that I enjoyed my comfortable income in
return, paid quarterly.

<P>Now and then I got away and changed the scene for a short time, always
asking leave of my lord and master first, and generally getting it. He
was not, as I have already told you, fool enough to drive me too hard,
and he could reasonably rely on my holding my tongue for my own sake, if
not for his. One of my longest trips away from home was the trip I took
to Limmeridge to nurse a half-sister there, who was dying. She was reported
to have saved money, and I thought it as well (in case any accident happened
to stop my allowance) to look after my own interests in that direction.
As things turned out, however, my pains were all thrown away, and I got
nothing, because nothing was to be had.

<P>I had taken Anne to the north with me, having my whims and fancies,
occasionally, about my child, and getting, at such times, jealous of Mrs
Clements' influence over her. I never liked Mrs Clements. She was a poor,
empty-headed, spiritless woman -- what you call a born drudge -- and I
was now and then not averse to plaguing her by taking Anne away. Not knowing
what else to do with my girl while I was nursing in Cumberland, I put her
to school at Limmeridge. The lady of the manor, Mrs Fairlie (a remarkably
plain-looking woman, who had entrapped one of the handsomest men in England
into marrying her), amused me wonderfully by taking a violent fancy to
my girl. The consequence was, she learnt nothing at school, and was petted
and spoilt at Limmeridge House. Among other whims and fancies which they
taught her there, they put some nonsense into her head about always wearing
white. Hating white and liking colours myself, I determined to take the
nonsense out of her head as soon as we got home again.

<P>Strange to say, my daughter resolutely resisted me. When she had got
a notion once fixed in her mind she was, like other halfwitted people,
as obstinate as a mule in keeping it. We quarrelled finely, and Mrs Clements,
not liking to see it, I suppose, offered to take Anne away to live in London
with her. I should have said Yes, if Mrs Clements had not sided with my
daughter about her dressing herself in white. But being determined she
should not dress herself in white, and disliking Mrs Clements more than
ever for taking part against me, I said No, and meant No, and stuck to
No. The consequence was, my daughter remained with me, and the consequence
of that, in its turn, was the first serious quarrel that happened about
the Secret.

<P>The circumstance took place long after the time I have just been writing
of. I had been settled for years in the new town, and was steadily living
down my bad character and slowly gaining ground among the respectable inhabitants.
It helped me forward greatly towards this object to have my daughter with
me. Her harmlessness and her fancy for dressing in white excited a certain
amount of sympathy. I left off opposing her favourite whim on that account,
because some of the sympathy was sure, in course of time, to fall to my
share. Some of it did fall. I date my getting a choice of the two best
sittings to let in the church from that time, and I date the clergyman's
first bow from my getting the sittings.

<P>Well, being settled in this way, I received a letter one morning from
that highly born gentleman (now deceased) in answer to one of mine, warning
him, according to agreement, of my wishing to leave the town for a little
change of air and scene.

<P>The ruffianly side of him must have been uppermost, I suppose, when
he got my letter, for he wrote back, refusing me in such abominably insolent
language, that I lost all command over myself, and abused him, in my daughter's
presence, as `a low imposter whom I could ruin for life if I chose to open
my lips and let out his Secret.' I said no more about him than that, being
brought to my senses as soon as those words had escaped me by the sight
of my daughter's face looking eagerly and curiously at mine. I instantly
ordered her out of the room until I had composed myself again.

<P>My sensations were not pleasant, I can tell you, when I came to reflect
on my own folly. Anne had been more than usually crazy and queer that year,
and when I thought of the chance there might be of her repeating my words
in the town, and mentioning his name in connection with them, if inquisitive
people got hold of her, I was finely terrified at the possible consequences.
My worst fears for myself, my worst dread of what he might do, led me no
farther than this. I was quite unprepared for what really did happen only
the next day.

<P>On that next day, without any warning to me to expect him, he came to
the house.

<P>His first words, and the tone in which he spoke them, surly as it was,
showed me plainly enough that he had repented already of his insolent answer
to my application, and that he had come in a mighty had temper to try and
set matters right again before it was too late. Seeing my daughter in the
room with me (I had been afraid to let her out of my sight after what had
happened the day before) he ordered her away. They neither of them liked
each other, and he vented the ill-temper on her which he was afraid to
show to <I>me.</I>

<P>`Leave us,' he said, looking at her over his shoulder. She looked back
over her shoulder and waited as if she didn't care to go. `Do you hear?'
he roared out, `leave the room.' `Speak to me civilly,' says she, getting
red in the face. `Turn the idiot out,' says he, looking my way. She had
always had crazy notions of her own about her dignity, and that word `idiot'
upset her in a moment. Before I could interfere she stepped up to him in
a fine passion. `Beg my pardon, directly,' says she, `or I'll make it the
worse for you. I'll let out your Secret. I can ruin you for life if I choose
to open my lips.' My own words! -- repeated exactly from what I had said
the day before -- repeated, in his presence, as if they had come from herself.
He sat speechless, as white as the paper I am writing on, while I pushed
her out of the room. When he recovered himself --

<P>No! I am too respectable a woman to mention what he said when he recovered
himself. My pen is the pen of a member of the rector's congregation, and
a subscriber to the `Wednesday Lectures on justification by Faith' -- how
can you expect me to employ it in writing bad language? Suppose, for yourself,
the raging, swearing frenzy of the lowest ruffian in England, and let us
get on together, as fast as may be, to the way in which it all ended.

<P>It ended, as you probably guess by this time, in his insisting on securing
his own safety by shutting her up.

<P>I tried to set things right. I told him that she had merely repeated,
like a parrot, the words she had heard me say and that she knew no particulars
whatever, because I had mentioned none. I explained that she had affected,
out of crazy spite against him, to know what she really did not know --
that she only wanted to threaten him and aggravate him for speaking to
her as he had just spoken -- ad that my unlucky words gave her just the
chance of doing mischief of which she was in search. I referred him to
other queer ways of hers, and to his own experience of the vagaries of
half-witted people -- it was all to no purpose -- he would not believe
me on my oath -- he was absolutely certain I had betrayed the whole Secret.
In short, he would hear of nothing but shutting her up.

<P>Under these circumstances, I did my duty as a mother. `No pauper Asylum,'
I said, `I won't have her put in a pauper Asylum. A Private Establishment,
if you please. I have my feelings as a mother, and my character to preserve
in the town, and I will submit to nothing but a Private Establishment,
of the sort which my genteel neighbours would choose for afflicted relatives
of their own.' Those were my words. It is gratifying to me to reflect that
I did my duty. Though never overfond of my late daughter, I had a proper
pride about her. No pauper stain -- thanks to my firmness and resolution
-- ever rested on My child.

<P>Having carried my point (which I did the more easily, in consequence
of the facilities offered by private Asylums), I could not refuse to admit
that there were certain advantages gained by shutting her up. In the first
place, she was taken excellent care of -- being treated (as I took care
to mention in the town) on the footing of a lady. In the second place,
she was kept away from Welmingham, where she might have set people suspecting
and inquiring, by repeating my own incautious words.

<P>The only drawback of putting her under restraint was a very slight one.
We merely turned her empty boast about knowing the Secret into a fixed
delusion. Having first spoken in sheer crazy spitefulness against the man
who had offended her, she was cunning enough to see that she had seriously
frightened him, and sharp enough afterwards to discover that <I>he</I>
was concerned in shutting her up. The consequence was she flamed out into
a perfect frenzy of passion against him, going to the Asylum, and the fist
words she said to the nurses, after they had quieted her, were, that she
was put in confinement for knowing his Secret, and that she meant to open
her lips and ruin him, when the right time came.

<P>She may have said the same thing to you, when you thoughtlessly assisted
her escape. She certainly said it (as I heard last summer) to the unfortunate
woman who married our sweet-tempered, nameless gentleman lately deceased.
If either you, or that unlucky lady, had questioned my daughter closely,
and had insisted on her explaining what she really meant, you would have
found her lose all her self-importance suddenly, and get vacant, and restless,
and confused -- you would have discovered that I am writing nothing here
but the plain truth. She knew that there was a Secret -- she knew who was
connected with it -- she knew who would suffer by its being known -- and
beyond that, whatever airs of importance she may have given herself, whatever
crazy boasting she may have indulged in with strangers, she never to her
dying day knew more.

<P>Have I satisfied your curiosity? I have taken pains enough to satisfy
it at any rate. There is really nothing else I have to tell you about myself
or my daughter. My worst responsibilities, so far as she was concerned,
were all over when she was secured in the Asylum. I had a form of letter
relating to the circumstances under which she was shut up, given me to
write, in answer to one Miss Halcombe, who was curious in the matter, and
who must have heard plenty of lies about me from a certain tongue well
accustomed to the telling of the same. And I did what I could afterwards
to trace my runaway daughter, and prevent her from doing mischief by making
inquiries myself in the neighbourhood where she was falsely reported to
have been seen. But these, and other trifles like them, are of little or
no interest to you after what you have heard already.

<P>So far, I have written in the friendliest possible spirit. But I cannot
close this letter, without adding a word here of serious remonstrance and
reproof, addressed to yourself.

<P>In the course of your personal interview with me, you audaciously referred
to my late daughter's parentage on the father's side, as if that parentage
was a matter of doubt. This was highly improper and very ungentlemanlike
on your part! If we see each other again, remember, if you please, that
I will allow no liberties to be taken with my reputation, and that the
moral atmosphere of Welmingham (to use a favourite expression of my friend
the rector's) must not be tainted by loose conversation of any kind. If
you allow yourself to doubt that my husband was Anne's father, you personally
insult me in the grossest manner. If you have felt, and if you still continue
to feel, an unhallowed curiosity on this subject, I recommend you, in your
own interests, to check it at once and for ever. On this side of the grave,
Mr Hartright, whatever may happen on the other, that curiosity will never
be gratified.

<P>Perhaps, after what I have just said, you will see the necessity of
writing me an apology. Do so, and I will willingly receive it. I will,
afterwards, if your wishes point to a second interview with me, go a step
farther, and receive you. My circumstances only enable me to invite you
to tea -- not that they are at all altered for the worse by what has happened.
I have always lived, as I think I told you, well within my income, and
I have saved enough, in the last twenty years, to make me quite comfortable
for the rest of my life. It is not my intention to leave Welmingham. There
are one or two little advantages which I have still to gain in the town.
The clergyman bows to me -- as you saw. He is married, and his wife is
not quite so civil. I propose to join the Dorcas Society, and I mean to
make the clergyman's wife bow to me next.

<P>If you favour me with your company, pray understand that the conversation
must be entirely on general subjects. Any attempted reference to this letter
will be quite useless -- I am determined not to acknowledge having written
it. The evidence has been destroyed in the fire, I know, but I think it
desirable to err on the side of caution, nevertheless.

<P>On this account no names are mentioned here, nor is any signature attached
to these lines: the handwriting is disguised throughout, and I mean to
deliver the letter myself, under circumstances which will prevent all fears
of its being traced to my house. You can have no possible cause to complain
of these precautions, seeing that they do not affect the information I
here communicate, in consideration of the special indulgence which you
have deserved at my hands. My hour for tea is half-past five, and my buttered
toast waits for nobody.

THE STORY CONTINUED BY WALTER HARTRIGHT</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H2>
XI</H2></CENTER>
My first impulse, after reading Mrs Catherick's extraordinary narrative,
was to destroy it. The hardened shameless depravity of the whole composition,
from beginning to end -- the atrocious perversity of mind which persistently
associated me with a calamity for which I was in no sense answerable, and
with a death which I had risked my life in trying to avert -- so disgusted
me, that I was on the point of tearing the letter, when a consideration
suggested itself which warned me to wait a little before I destroyed it.

<P>This consideration was entirely unconnected with Sir Percival. The information
communicated to me, so far as it concerned him, did little more than confirm
the conclusions at which I had already arrived.

<P>He had committed his offence, as I had supposed him to have committed
it, and the absence of all reference, on Mrs Catherick's part, to the duplicate
register at Knowlesbury, strengthened my previous conviction that the existence
of the book, and the risk of detection which it implied, must have been
necessarily unknown to Sir Percival. My interest in the question of the
forgery was now at an end, and my only object in keeping the letter was
to make it of some future service in clearing up the last mystery that
still remained to baffle me -- the parentage of Anne Catherick on the father's
side. There were one or two sentences dropped in her mother's narrative,
which it might be useful to refer to again, when matters of more immediate
importance allowed me leisure to search for the missing evidence. I did
not despair of still finding that evidence, and I had lost none of my anxiety
to discover it, for I had lost none of my interest in tracing the father
of the poor creature who now lay at rest in Mrs Fairlie's grave.

<P>Accordingly, I sealed up the letter and put it away carefully in my
pocket-book, to be referred to again when the time came.

<P>The next day was my last in Hampshire. When I had appeared again before
the magistrate at Knowlesbury, and when I had attended at the adjourned
inquest, I should be free to return to London by the afternoon or the evening
train.

<P>My first errand in the morning was, as usual, to the post-office, The
letter from Marian was there, but I thought when it was handed to me that
it felt unusually light. I anxiously opened the envelope. There was nothing
inside but a small strip of paper folded in two. The few blotted hurriedly-written
lines which were traced on it contained these words:

<P>`Come back as soon as you can. I have been obliged to move. Come to
Gower's Walk, Fulham (number five). I will be on the look-out for you.
Don't be alarmed about us, we are both safe and well. But come back. --
Marian.'

<P>The news which those lines contained -- news which I instantly associated
with some attempted treachery on the part of Count Fosco -- fairly overwhelmed
me. I stood breathless with the paper crumpled up in my hand. What had
happened? What subtle wickedness had the Count planned and executed in
my absence? A night had passed since Marian's note was written -- hours
must elapse still before I could get back to them -- some new disaster
might have happened already of which I was ignorant. And here, miles and
miles away from them, here I must remain -- held, doubly held, at the disposal
of the law!

<P>I hardly know to what forgetfulness of my obligations anxiety and alarm
might not have tempted me, but for the quieting influence of my faith in
Marian. My absolute reliance on her was the one earthly consideration which
helped me to restrain myself, and gave me courage to wait. The inquest
was the first of the impediments in the way of my freedom of action. I
attended it at the appointed time, the legal formalities requiring my presence
in the room, but as it turned out, not calling on me to repeat my evidence.
This useless delay was a hard trial, although I did my best to quiet my
impatience by following the course of the proceedings as closely as I could.

<P>The London solicitor of the deceased (Mr Merriman) was among the persons
present. But he was quite unable to assist the objects of the inquiry.
He could only say that he was inexpressibly shocked and astonished, and
that he could throw no light whatever on the mysterious circumstances of
the case. At intervals during the adjourned investigation, he suggested
questions which the Coroner put, but which led to no results. After a patient
inquiry, which lasted nearly three hours, and which exhausted every available
source of information, the jury pronounced the customary verdict in cases
of sudden death by accident. They added to the formal decision a statement,
that there had been no evidence to show how the keys had been abstracted,
how the fire had been caused, or what the purpose was for which the deceased
had entered the vestry. This act closed the proceedings. The legal representative
of the dead man was left to provide for the necessities of the interment,
and the witnesses were free to retire.

<P>Resolved not to lose a minute in getting to Knowlesbury, I paid my bill
at the hotel, and hired a fly to take me to the town. A gentleman who heard
me give the order, and who saw that I was going alone, informed me that
he lived in the neighbourhood of Knowlesbury, and asked if I would have
any objection to his getting home by sharing the fly with me. I accepted
his proposal as a matter of course.

<P>Our conversation during the drive was naturally occupied by the one
absorbing subject of local interest.

<P>My new acquaintance had some knowledge of the late Sir Percival's solicitor,
and he and Mr Merriman had been discussing the state of the deceased gentleman's
affairs and the succession to the property. Sir Percival's embarrassments
were so well known all over the county that his solicitor could only make
a virtue of necessity and plainly acknowledge them. He had died without
leaving a will, and he had no personal property to bequeath, even if he
had made one, the whole fortune which he had derived from his wife having
been swallowed up by his creditors. The heir to the estate (Sir Percival
having left no issue) was a son of Sir Felix Glyde's first cousin, an officer
in command of an East Indiaman. He would find his unexpected inheritance
sadly encumbered, but the property would recover with time, and, if `the
captain' was careful, he might be a rich man yet before he died.

<P>Absorbed as I was in the one idea of getting to London, this information
(which events proved to be perfectly correct) had an interest of its own
to attract my attention. I thought it justified me in keeping secret my
discovery of Sir Percival's fraud. The heir, whose rights he had usurped,
was the heir who would now have the estate. The income from it, for the
last three-and-twenty years, which should properly have been his, and which
the dead man had squandered to the last farthing, was gone beyond recall.
If I spoke, my speaking would confer advantage on to no one. If I kept
the secret, my silence concealed the character of the man who had cheated
Laura into marrying him. For her sake, I wished to conceal it -- for her
sake, still, I tell this story under feigned names.

<P>I parted with my chance companion at Knowlesbury, and went at once to
the town-hall. As I had anticipated, no one was present to prosecute the
case against me -- the necessary formalities were observed, and I was discharged.
On leaving the court a letter from Mr Dawson was put into my hand. It informed
me that he was absent on professional duty, and it reiterated the offer
I had already received from him of any assistance which I might require
at his hands. I wrote back, warmly acknowledging my obligations to his
kindness, and apologising for not expressing my thanks personally, in consequence
of my immediate recall on pressing business to town.

<P>Half an hour later I was speeding back to London by the express train.
