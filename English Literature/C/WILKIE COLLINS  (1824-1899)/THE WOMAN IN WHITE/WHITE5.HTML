Not a word more was said, on either side, as we walked back to the house.
Miss Halcombe hastened immediately to her sister's room, and I withdrew
to my studio to set in order all of Mr Fairlie's drawings that I had not
yet mounted and restored before I resigned them to the care of other hands.
Thoughts that I had hitherto restrained, thoughts that made my position
harder than ever to endure, crowded on me now that I was alone.

<P>She was engaged to be married, and her future husband was Sir Percival
Glyde. A man of the rank of Baronet, and the owner of property in Hampshire.

<P>There were hundreds of baronets in England, and dozens of landowners
in Hampshire. Judging by the ordinary rules of evidence, I had not the
shadow of a reason, thus far, for connecting Sir Percival Glyde with the
suspicious words of inquiry that had been spoken to me by the woman in
white. And yet, I did connect him with them. Was it because he had now
become associated in my mind with Miss Fairlie, Miss Fairlie being, in
her turn, associated with Anne Catherick, since the night when I had discovered
the ominous likeness between them? Had the events of the morning so unnerved
me already that I was at the mercy of any delusion which common chances
and common coincidences might suggest to my imagination? Impossible to
say. I could only feel that what had passed between Miss Halcombe and myself,
on our way from the summer-house, had affected me very strangely. The foreboding
of some undiscoverable danger lying hid from us all in the darkness of
the future was strong on me. The doubt whether I was not linked already
to a chain of events which even my approaching departure from Cumberland
would be Powerless to snap asunder -- the doubt whether we any of us saw
the end as the end would really be -- gathered more and more darkly over
my mind. Poignant as it was, the sense of suffering caused by the miserable
end of my brief, presumptuous love seemed to be blunted and deadened by
the still stronger sense of something obscurely impending, something invisibly
threatening, that Time was holding over our heads.

<P>I had been engaged with the drawings little more than half an hour,
when there was a knock at the door. It opened, on my answering; and, to
my surprise, Miss Halcombe entered the room.

<P>Her manner was angry and agitated. She caught up a chair for herself
before I could give her one, and sat down in it, close at my side.

<P>`Mr Hartright,' she said, `I had hoped that all painful subjects of
conversation were exhausted between us, for today at least. But it is not
to be so. There is some underhand villainy at work to frighten my sister
about her approaching marriage. You saw me send the gardener on to the
house, with a letter addressed, in a strange handwriting, to Miss Fairlie?'

<P>`Certainly.'

<P>`The letter is an anonymous letter -- a vile attempt to injure Sir Percival
Glyde in my sister's estimation. It has so agitated and alarmed her that
I have had the greatest possible difficulty in composing her spirits sufficiently
to allow me to leave her room and come here. I know this is a family matter
on which I ought not to consult you, and in which you can feel no concern
or interest --'

<P>`I beg your pardon, Miss Halcombe. I feel the strongest possible concern
and interest in anything that affects Miss Fairlie's happiness or yours.'

<P>`I am glad to hear you say so. You are the only person in the house,
or out of it, who can advise me. Mr Fairlie, in his state of health and
with his horror of difficulties and mysteries of all kinds, is not to be
thought of. The clergyman is a good, weak man, who knows nothing out of
the routine of his duties; and our neighbours are just the sort of comfortable,
jog-trot acquaintances whom one cannot disturb in times of trouble and
danger. What I want to know is this: ought I at once to take such steps
as I can to discover the writer of the letter? or ought I to wait, and
apply to Mr Fairlie's legal adviser tomorrow? It is a question -- perhaps
a very important one -- of gaining or losing a day. Tell me what you think,
Mr Hartright. If necessity had not already obliged me to take you into
my confidence under very delicate circumstances, even my helpless situation
would, perhaps, be no excuse for me. But as things are I cannot surely
be wrong, after all that has passed between us, in forgetting that you
are a friend of only three months' standing.'

<P>She gave me the letter. It began abruptly, without any preliminary form
of address, as follows --

<P>`Do you believe in dreams? I hope, for your own sake, that you do. See
what Scripture says about dreams and their fulfilment (Genesis xl. 8, xli.
25; Daniel iv. 18-25), and take the warning I send you before it is too
late.

<P>`Last night I dreamed about you, Miss Fairlie. I dreamed that I was
standing inside the communion rails of a church -- I on one side of the
altar-table, and the clergyman, with his surplice and his prayer-book,
on the other.

<P>`After a time there walked towards us, down the aisle of the church,
a man and a woman, coming to be married. You were the woman. You looked
so pretty and innocent in your beautiful white silk dress, and your long
white lace veil, that my heart felt for you, and the tears came into my
eyes.

<P>`They were tears of pity, young lady, that heaven blesses; and instead
of falling from my eyes like the everyday tears that we all of us shed,
they turned into two rays of light which slanted nearer and nearer to the
man standing at the altar with you, till they touched his breast. The two
rays sprang in arches like two rainbows between me and him. I looked along
them, and I saw down into his inmost heart.

<P>`The outside of the man you were marrying was fair enough to see. He
was neither tall nor short -- he was a little below the middle size. A
light, active, high-spirited man -- about five-and-forty years old, to
look at. He had a pale face, and was bald over the forehead, but had dark
hair on the rest of his head. His beard was shaven on his chin, but was
let to grow, of a fine rich brown, on his cheeks and his upper lip. His
eyes were brown too, and very bright; his nose straight and handsome, and
delicate enough to have done for a woman's. His hands the same. He was
troubled from time to time with a dry hacking cough, and when he put up
his white right hand to his mouth, he showed the red scar of an old wound
across the back of it. Have I dreamt of the right man? You know best, Miss
Fairlie, and you can say if I was deceived or not. Read next, what I saw
beneath the outside -- I entreat you, read, and profit.

<P>`I looked along the two rays of light, and I saw down into his inmost
heart. It was black as night, and on it were written, in the red flaming
letters which are the handwriting of the fallen angel, ``Without pity and
without remorse. He has strewn with misery the paths of others, and he
will live to strew with misery the path of this woman by his side.'' I
read that, and then the rays of light shifted and pointed over his shoulder;
and there, behind him, stood a fiend laughing. And the rays of light shifted
once more, and pointed over your shoulder; and there, behind you, stood
an angel weeping. And the rays of light shifted for the third time, and
pointed straight between you and that man. They widened and widened, thrusting
you both asunder, one from the other. And the clergyman looked for the
marriage-service in vain; it was gone out of the book, and he shut up the
leaves, and put it from him in despair. And I woke with my eyes full of
tears and my heart beating -- for I believe in dreams.

<P>`Believe too, Miss Fairlie -- I beg of you, for your own sake, believe
as I do. Joseph and Daniel, and others in the Scripture, believed in dreams.
Inquire into the past life of that man with the scar on his hand, before
you say the words that make you his miserable wife. I don't give you this
warning on my account, but on yours. I have an interest in your well-being
that will live as long as I draw breath. Your mother's daughter has a tender
place in my heart -- for your mother was my first, my best, my only friend.'

<P>There the extraordinary letter ended, without a signature of any sort.

<P>The handwriting afforded no prospect of a clue. It was traced on ruled
lines, in the cramped, conventional copy-book character technically termed
`mall hand.' It was feeble and faint, and defaced by blots, but had otherwise
nothing to distinguish it.

<P>`That is not an illiterate letter,' said Miss Halcombe, `and at the
same time, it is surely too incoherent to be the letter of an educated
person in the higher ranks of life. The reference to the bridal dress and
veil, and other little expressions, seem to point to it as the production
of some woman. What do you think, Mr Hartright?'

<P>`I think so too. It seems to me to be not only the letter of a woman,
but of a woman whose mind must be --'

<P>`Deranged?' suggested Miss Halcombe. `It struck me in that light too.'

<P>I did not answer. While I was speaking, my eyes rested on the last sentence
of the letter: `Your mother's daughter has a tender place in my heart --
for your mother was my first, my best, my only friend.' Those words and
the doubt which had just escaped me as to the sanity of the writer of the
letter, acting together on my mind, suggested an idea, which I was literally
afraid to express openly, or even to encourage secretly. I began to doubt
whether my own faculties were not in danger of losing their balance. It
seemed almost like a monomania to be tracing back everything strange that
happened, everything unexpected that was said, always to the same hidden
source and the same sinister influence. I resolved, this time, in defence
of my own courage and my own sense, to come to no decision that plain fact
did not warrant, and to turn my back resolutely on everything that tempted
me in the shape of surmise.

<P>`If we have any chance of tracing the person who has written this,'
I said, returning the letter to Miss Halcombe, `there can be no harm in
seizing our opportunity the moment it offers. I think we ought to speak
to the gardener again about the elderly woman who gave him the letter,
and then to continue our inquiries in the village. But first let me ask
a question. You mentioned just now the alternative of consulting Mr Fairlie's
legal adviser tomorrow. Is there no possibility of communicating with him
earlier? Why not today?'

<P>`I can only explain,' replied Miss Halcombe, `by entering into certain
particulars, connected with my sister's marriage-engagement, which I did
not think it necessary or desirable to mention to you this morning. One
of Sir Percival Glyde's objects in coming here on Monday, is to fix the
period of his marriage, which has hitherto been left quite unsettled. He
is anxious that the event should take place before the end of the year.'

<P>`Does Miss Fairlie know of that wish?' I asked eagerly.

<P>`She has no suspicion of it, and after what has happened, I shall not
take the responsibility upon myself of enlightening her. Sir Percival has
only mentioned his views to Mr Fairlie, who has told me himself that he
is ready and anxious, as Laura's guardian, to forward them. He has written
to London, to the family solicitor, Mr Gilmore. Mr Gilmore happens to be
away in Glasgow on business, and he has replied by proposing to stop at
Limmeridge House on his way back to town. He will arrive tomorrow, and
will stay with us a few days, so as to allow Sir Percival time to plead
his own cause. If he succeeds, Mr Gilmore will then return to London, taking
with him his instructions for my sister's marriage-settlement. You understand
now, Mr Hartright, why I speak of waiting to take legal advice until tomorrow?
Mr Gilmore is the old and tried friend of two generations of Fairlies,
and we can trust him, as we could trust no one else.'

<P>The marriage-settlement! The mere hearing of those two words stung me
with a jealous despair that was poison to my higher and better instincts.
I began to think -- it is hard to con fess this, but I must suppress nothing
from beginning to end of the terrible story that I now stand committed
to reveal -- I began to think, with a hateful eagerness of hope, of the
vague charges against Sir Percival Glyde which the anonymous letter contained.
What if those wild accusations rested on a foundation of truth? What if
their truth could be proved before the fatal words of consent were spoken,
and the marriage-settlement was drawn? I have tried to think since, that
the feeling which then animated me began and ended in pure devotion to
Miss Fairlie's interests, but I have never succeeded in deceiving myself
into believing it, and I must not now attempt to deceive others. The feeling
began and ended in reckless, vindictive, hopeless hatred of the man who
was to marry her.

<P>`If we are to find out anything,' I said, speaking under the new influence
which was now directing me, `we had better not let another minute slip
by us unemployed. I can only suggest, once more, the propriety of questioning
the gardener a second time, and of inquiring in the village immediately
afterwards.'

<P>`I think I may be of help to you in both cases,' said Miss Halcombe,
rising. `Let us go, Mr Hartright, at once, and do the best we can together.'

<P>I had the door in my hand to open it for her -- but I stopped, on a
sudden, to ask an important question before we set forth.

<P>`One of the paragraphs of the anonymous letter,' I said. `contains some
sentences of minute personal description. Sir Percival Glyde's name is
not mentioned, I know -- but does that description at all resemble him?'

<P>`Accurately -- even in stating his age to be forty-five --'

<P>Forty-five; and she was not yet twenty-one! Men of his age married wives
of her age every day -- and experience had shown those marriages to be
often the happiest ones. I knew that -- and yet even the mention of his
age, when I contrasted it with hers, added to my blind hatred and distrust
of him.

<P>`Accurately,' Miss Halcombe continued, `even to the scar on his right
hand, which is the scar of a wound that he received years since when he
was travelling in Italy. There can be no doubt that every peculiarity of
his personal appearance is thoroughly well known to the writer of the letter.'

<P>`Even a cough that he is troubled with is mentioned, if I remember right?'

<P>`Yes, and mentioned correctly. He treats it lightly himself, though
it sometimes makes his friends anxious about him.'

<P>`I suppose no whispers have ever been heard against his character?'

<P>`Mr Hartright! I hope you are not unjust enough to let that infamous
letter influence you?'

<P>I felt the blood rush into my cheeks; for I knew that it had influenced
me.

<P>`I hope not,' I answered confusedly. `Perhaps I had no right to ask
the question.'

<P>`I am not sorry you asked it,' she said, `for it enables me to do justice
to Sir Percival's reputation. Not a whisper, Mr Hartright, has ever reached
me, or my family, against him. He has fought successfully two contested
elections, and has come out of the ordeal unscathed. A man who can do that,
in England, is a man whose character is established.'

<P>I opened the door for her in silence, and followed her out. She had
not convinced me. If the recording angel had come down from heaven to confirm
her, and had opened his book to my mortal eyes, the recording angel would
not have convinced me.

<P>We found the gardener at work as usual. No amount of questioning could
extract a single answer of any importance from the lad's impenetrable stupidity.
The woman who had given him the letter was an elderly woman; she had not
spoken a word to him, and she had gone away towards the south in a great
hurry. That was all the gardener could tell us.

<P>The village lay southward of the house. So to the village we went next.

Our inquiries at Limmeridge were patiently pursued in all directions, and
among all sorts and conditions of people. But nothing came of them. Three
of the villagers did certainly assure us that they had seen the woman,
but as they were quite unable to describe her, and quite incapable of agreeing
about the exact direction in which she was proceeding when they last saw
her, these three bright exceptions to the general rude of total ignorance
afforded no more real assistance to us than the mass of their unhelpful
and unobservant neighbours.

<P>The course of our useless investigations brought us, in time, to the
end of the village at which the schools established by Mrs Fairlie were
situated. As we passed the side of the building appropriated to the use
of the boys, I suggested the propriety of making a last inquiry of the
schoolmaster, whom we might presume to be, in virtue of his office, the
most intelligent man in the place.

<P>`I am afraid the schoolmaster must have been occupied with his scholars,'
said Miss Halcombe, `just at the time when the woman passed through the
village and returned again. However, we can but try.'

<P>We entered the playground enclosure, and walked by the schoolroom window
to get round to the door, which was situated at the back of the building.
I stopped for a moment at the window and looked in.

<P>The schoolmaster was sitting at his high desk, with his back to me,
apparently haranguing the pupils, who were all gathered together in front
of him, with one exception. The one exception was a sturdy white-headed
boy, standing apart from all the rest on a stool in a comer -- a forlorn
little Crusoe, isolated in his own desert island of solitary penal disgrace.

<P>The door, when we got round to it, was ajar, and the schoolmaster's
voice reached us plainly, as we both stopped for a minute under the porch.

<P>`Now, boys,' said the voice, `mind what I tell you. If I hear another
word spoken about ghosts in this school, it will be the worse for all of
you. There are no such things as ghosts, and therefore any boy who believes
in ghosts believes in what can't possibly be; and a boy who belongs to
Limmeridge School, and believes in what can't possibly be, sets up his
back against reason and discipline, and must be punished accordingly. You
all see Jacob Postlethwaite standing up on the stool there in disgrace.
He has been punished, not because he said he saw a ghost last night, but
because he is too impudent and too obstinate to listen to reason, and because
he persists in saying he saw the ghost after I have told him that no such
thing can possibly be. If nothing else will do, I mean to cane the ghost
out of Jacob Postlethwaite, and if the thing spreads among any of the rest
of you, I mean to go a step farther, and cane the ghost out of the whole
school.'

<P>`We seem to have chosen an awkward moment for our visit,' said Miss
Halcombe, pushing open the door at the end of the schoolmaster's address,
and leading the way in.

<P>Our appearance produced a strong sensation among the boys. They appeared
to think that we had arrived for the express purpose of seeing Jacob Postlethwaite
caned.

<P>`Go home all of you to dinner,' said the schoolmaster, `except Jacob.
Jacob must stop where he is; and the ghost may bring him his dinner, if
the ghost pleases.'

<P>Jacob's fortitude deserted him at the double disappearance of his schoolfellows
and his prospect of dinner. He took his hands out of his pockets, looked
hard at his knuckles, raised them with great deliberation to his eyes,
and when they got there, ground them round and round slowly, accompanying
the action by short spasms of sniffing, which followed each other at regular
intervals -- the nasal minute guns of juvenile distress.

<P>`We came here to ask you a question, Mr Dempster.' said Miss Halcombe,
addressing the schoolmaster; `and we little expected to find you occupied
in exorcising a ghost. What does it all mean? What has really happened?'

<P>`That wicked boy has been frightening the whole school, Miss Halcombe,
by declaring that he saw a ghost yesterday evening,' answered the master;
`and he still persists in his absurd story, in spite of all that I can
say to him.'

<P>`Most extraordinary,' said Miss Halcombe. `I should not have thought
it possible that any of the boys had imagination enough to see a ghost.
This is a new accession indeed to the hard labour of forming the youthful
mind at Limmeridge, and I heartily wish you well through it, Mr Dempster.
In the meantime, let me explain why you see me here, and what it is I want.'

<P>She then put the same question to the schoolmaster which we had asked
already of almost everyone else in the village. It was met by the same
discouraging answer. Mr Dempster had not set eyes on the stranger of whom
we were in search.

<P>`We may as well return to the house, Mr Hartright,' said Miss Halcombe;
`the information we want is evidently not to be found.'

<P>She had bowed to Mr Dempster, and was about to leave the schoolroom,
when the forlorn position of Jacob Postlethwaite, piteously sniffing on
the stool of penitence, attracted her attention as she passed him, and
made her stop good-humouredly to speak a word to the little prisoner before
she opened the door.

<P>`You foolish boy,' she said, `why don't you beg Mr Dempster's pardon,
and hold your tongue about the ghost?'

<P>`Eh! -- but I saw t' ghaist,' persisted Jacob Postlethwaite, with a
stare of terror and a burst of tears.

<P>`Stuff and nonsense! You saw nothing of the kind. Ghost indeed! What
ghost --'

<P>`I beg your pardon, Miss Halcombe,' interposed the schoolmaster a little
uneasily -- `but I think you had better not question the boy. The obstinate
folly of his story is beyond all belief; and you might lead him into ignorantly.'

<P>`Ignorantly what?' inquired Miss Halcombe sharply.

<P>`Ignorantly shocking your feelings,' said Mr Dempster, looking very
much discomposed.

<P>`Upon my word, Mr Dempster, you pay my feelings a great compliment in
thinking them weak enough to be shocked by such an urchin as that!' She
turned with an air of satirical defiance to little Jacob, and began to
question him directly. `Come!' she said, `I mean to know all about this.
You naughty boy, when did you see the ghost?'

<P>`Yestere'en, at the gloaming,' replied Jacob.

<P>`Oh! you saw it yesterday evening, in the twilight? And what was it
like?'

<P>`Arl in white -- as a ghaist should be,' answered the ghostseer, with
a confidence beyond his years.

<P>`And where was it?'

<P>`Away yander, in t' kirkyard -- where a ghaist ought to be.'

<P>`As a ``ghaist'' should be -- where a ``ghaist'' ought to be -- why,
you little fool, you talk as if the manners and customs of ghosts had been
familiar to you from your infancy! You have got your story at your fingers'
ends, at any rate. I suppose I shall hear next that you can actually tell
me whose ghost it was?'

<P>`Eh! but I just can,' replied Jacob, nodding his head with an air of
gloomy triumph.

<P>Mr Dempster had already tried several times to speak while Miss Halcombe
was examining his pupil, and he now interposed resolutely enough to make
himself heard.

<P>`Excuse me, Miss Halcombe,' he said, `if I venture to say that you are
only encouraging the boy by asking him these questions.'

<P>`I will merely ask one more, Mr Dempster, and then I shall be quite
satisfied. Well,' she continued, turning to the boy, `and whose ghost was
it?'

<P>`T'ghaist of Mistress Fairlie,' answered Jacob in a whisper.

<P>The effect which this extraordinary reply produced on Miss Halcombe
fully justified the anxiety which the schoolmaster had shown to prevent
her from hearing it. Her face crimsoned with indignation -- she turned
upon little Jacob with an angry suddenness which terrified him into a fresh
burst of tears -- opened her lips to speak to him -- then controlled herself,
and addressed the master instead of the boy.

<P>`It is useless,' she said, `to hold such a child as that responsible
for what he says. I have little doubt that the idea has been put into his
head by others. If there are people in this village, Mr Dempster, who have
forgotten the respect and gratitude due from every soul in it to my mother's
memory, I will find them out, and if I have any influence with Mr Fairlie,
they shall suffer for it.'

<P>`I hope -- indeed. I am sure, Miss Halcombe -- that you are mistaken.'
said the schoolmaster. `The matter begins and ends with the boy's own perversity
and folly. He saw, or thought he saw, a woman in white, yesterday evening,
as he was passing the churchyard; and the figure. real or fancied, was
standing by the marble cross, which he and everyone else in Limmeridge
knows to he the monument over Mrs Fairlie's grave. These two circumstances
are surely sufficient to have suggested to the boy himself the answer which
has so naturally shocked you?'

<P>Although Miss Halcombe did not seem to be convinced, she evidently felt
that the schoolmaster's statement of the case was too sensible to be openly
combated. She merely replied by thanking him for his attention, and by
promising to see him again when her doubts were satisfied. This said, she
bowed, and led the way out of the schoolroom.

<P>Throughout the whole of this strange scene I had stood apart, listening
attentively, and drawing my own conclusions. As soon as we were alone again,
Miss Halcombe asked me if I had formed any opinion on what I had heard.

<P>`A very strong opinion,' I answered; `the boy's story, as I believe,
has a foundation in fact. I confess I am anxious to see the monument over
Mrs Fairlie's grave, and to examine the ground about it.'

<P>`You shall see the grave.'

<P>She paused after making that reply, and reflected a little as we walked
on. `What has happened in the schoolroom,' she resumed, `has so completely
distracted my attention from the subject of the letter, that I feel a little
bewildered when I try to return to it. Must we give up all idea of making
any further inquiries, and wait to place the thing in Mr Gilmore's hands
tomorrow?'

<P>`By no means, Miss Halcombe. What has happened in the schoolroom encourages
me to persevere in the investigation.'

<P>`Why does it encourage you?'

<P>`Because it strengthens a suspicion I felt when you gave me the letter
to read.'

<P>`I suppose you had your reasons, Mr Hartright, for concealing that suspicion
from me till this moment?'

<P>`I was afraid to encourage it in myself. I thought it was utterly preposterous
-- I distrusted it as the result of some perversity in my own imagination.
But I can do so no longer. Not only the boy's own answers to your questions,
but even a chance expression that dropped from the schoolmaster's lips
in explaining his story, have forced the idea hack into my mind. Events
may yet prove that idea to be a delusion, Miss Halcombe; but the belief
is strong in me, at this moment, that the fancied ghost in the churchyard,
and the writer of the anonymous letter, are one and the same person.'

<P>She stopped, turned pale, and looked me eagerly in the face,

<P>`What person?'

<P>`The schoolmaster unconsciously told you. When he spoke of the figure
that the boy saw in the churchyard he called it ``a woman in white.'''

<P>`Not Anne Catherick?'

<P>`Yes, Anne Catherick.'

<P>She put her hand through my arm and leaned on it heavily.

<P>`I don't know why,' she said in low tones, `but there is something in
this suspicion of yours that seems to startle and unnerve me. I feel --'
She stopped, and tried to laugh it off. `Mr Hartright,' she went on, `I
will show you the grave, and then go back at once to the house. I had better
not leave Laura too long alone. I had better go back and sit with her.'

<P>We were close to the churchyard when she spoke. The church, a dreary
building of grey stone, was situated in a little valley, so as to be sheltered
from the bleak winds blowing over the moorland all round it. The burial-ground
advanced, from the side of the church, a little way up the slope of the
hill. It was surrounded by a rough, low stone wall. and was bare and open
to the sky, except at one extremity, where a brook trickled down the stony
hillside, and a clump of dwarf trees threw their narrow shadows over the
short, meagre grass. Just beyond the brook and the trees, and not far from
one of the three stone stiles which afforded entrance, at various points,
to the churchyard, rose the white marble cross that distinguished Mrs Fairlie's
grave from the humbler monuments scattered about it.

<P>`I need go no farther with you,' said Miss Halcombe, pointing to the
grave. `You will let me know if you find anything to confirm the idea you
have just mentioned to me. Let us meet again at the house.'

<P>She left me. I descended at once to the churchyard, and crossed the
stile which led directly to Mrs Fairlie's grave.

<P>The grass about it was too short, and the ground too hard, to show any
marks of footsteps. Disappointed thus far, I next looked attentively at
the cross, and at the square block of marble below it, on which the inscription
was cut.

<P>The natural whiteness of the cross was a little clouded, here and there,
by weather stains, and rather more than one half of the square block beneath
it. on the side which bore the inscription, was in the same condition.
The other half, however, attracted my attention at once by its singular
freedom from stain or impurity of any kind. I looked closer, and saw that
it had been cleaned -- recently cleaned, in a downward direction from top
to bottom. The boundary line between the part that had been cleaned and
the part that had not was traceable wherever the inscription left a blank
space of marble -- sharply traceable as a line that had been produced by
artificial means. Who had begun the cleansing of the marble, and who had
left it unfinished?

<P>I looked about me, wondering how the question was to be solved. No sign
of a habitation could be discerned from the point at which I was standing
-- the burial-ground was left in the lonely possession of the dead. I returned
to the church, and walked round it till I came to the back of the building;
then crossed the boundary wall beyond, by another of the stone stiles,
and found myself at the head of a path leading down into a deserted stone
quarry. Against one side of the quarry a little two-room cottage was built,
and just outside the door an old woman was engaged in washing.

<P>I walked up to her, and entered into conversation about the church and
burial-ground. She was ready enough to talk, and almost the first words
she said informed me that her husband filled the two offices of clerk and
sexton. I said a few words next in praise of Mrs Fairlie's monument. The
old woman shook her head, and told me I had not seen it at its best. It
was her husband's business to look after it, but he had been so ailing
and weak for months and months past, that he had hardly been able to crawl
into church on Sundays to do his duty, and the monument had been neglected
in consequence. He was getting a little better now, and in a week or ten
days' time he hoped to be strong enough to set to work and clean it.

<P>This information -- extracted from a long rambling answer in the broadest
Cumberland dialect -- told me all that I most wanted to know. I gave the
poor woman a trifle, and returned at once to Limmeridge House.

<P>The partial cleansing of the monument had evidently been accomplished
by a strange hand. Connecting what I had discovered, thus far, with what
I had suspected after hearing the story of the ghost seen at twilight,
I wanted nothing more to confirm my resolution to watch Mrs Fairlie's grave,
in secret, that evening, returning to it at sunset, and waiting within
sight of it till the night fell. The work of cleansing the monument had
been left unfinished, and the person by whom it had been begun might return
to complete it.

<P>On getting back to the house I informed Miss Halcombe of what I intended
to do. She looked surPrised and uneasy while I was explaining my purpose,
but she made no positive objection to the execution of it. She only said,
`I hope it may end well.' Just as she was leaving me again, I stopped her
to inquire, as calmly as I could, after Miss Fairlie's health. She was
in better spirits, and Miss Halcombe hoped she might be induced to take
a little walking exercise while the afternoon sun lasted.

<P>I returned to my own room to resume setting the drawings in order. It
was necessary to do this, and doubly necessary to keep my mind employed
on anything that would help to distract my attention from myself, and from
the hopeless future that lay before me. From time to time I paused in my
work to look out of window and watch the sky as the sun sank nearer and
nearer to the horizon. On one of those occasions I saw a figure on the
broad gravel walk under my window. It was Miss Fairlie.

<P>I had not seen her since the morning, and I had hardly spoken to her
then. Another day at Limmeridge was all that remained to me, and after
that day my eyes might never look on her again. This thought was enough
to hold me at the window. I had sufficient consideration for her to arrange
the blind so that she might not see me if she looked up, but I had no strength
to resist the temptation of letting my eyes, at least, follow her as far
as they could on her walk.

<P>She was dressed in a brown cloak, with a Plain black silk gown under
it. On her head was the same simple straw hat which she had worn on the
morning when we first met. A veil was attached to it now which hid her
face from me. By her side trotted a little Italian greyhound, the pet companion
of all her walks, smartly dressed in a scarlet cloth wrapper, to keep the
sharp air from his delicate skin. She did not seem to notice the dog. She
walked straight forward, with her head drooping a little, and her arms
folded in her cloak. The dead leaves, which had whirled in the wind before
me when I had heard of her marriage engagement in the morning, whirled
in the wind before her, and rose and fell and scattered themselves at her
feet as she walked on in the pale waning sunlight- The dog shivered and
trembled, and pressed against her dress impatiently for notice and encouragement.
But she never heeded him. She walked on, farther and farther away from
me, with the dead leaves whirling about her on the path -- walked on, till
my aching eyes could see her no more, and I was left alone again with my
own heavy heart.

<P>In another hour's time I had done my work, and the sunset was at hand.
I got my hat and coat in the hall, and slipped out of the house without
meeting anyone.

<P>The clouds were wild in the western heaven, and the wind blew chill
from the sea. far as the shore was, the sound of the surf swept over the
intervening moorland, and beat drearily in my ears when I entered the churchyard.
Not a living creature was in sight. The place looked lonelier than ever
as I chose my position, and waited and watched, with my eyes on the white
cross that rose over Mrs Fairlie's grave.
