My first conviction as soon as I found myself outside the house, was that
no alternative was left me but to act at once on the information I had
received -- to make sure of the Count that night, or to risk the loss,
if I only delayed till the morning, of Laura's last chance. I looked at
my watch -- it was ten o'clock.

<P>Not the shadow of a doubt crossed my mind of the purpose for which the
Count had left the theatre. His escape from us, that evening, was beyond
all question the preliminary only to his escape from London. The mark of
the Brotherhood was on his arm -- I felt as certain of it as if he had
shown me the brand; and the betrayal of the Brotherhood was on his conscience
-- I had seen it in his recognition of Pesca.

<P>It was easy to understand why that recognition had not been mutual.
A man of the Count's character would never risk the terrible consequences
of turning spy without looking to his personal security quite as carefully
as he looked to his golden reward. The shaven face, which I had pointed
out at the Opera, might have been covered by a beard in Pesca's time --
his dark brown hair might be a wig -- his name was evidently a false one.
The accident of time might have helped him as well -- his immense corpulence
might have come with his later years. There was every reason why Pesca
should not have known him again -- every reason also why he should have
known Pesca, whose singular personal appearance made a marked man of him,
go where he might.

<P>I have said that I felt certain of the purpose in the Count's mind when
he escaped us at the theatre. How could I doubt it, when I saw, with my
own eyes, that he believed himself, in spite of the change in his appearance,
to have been recognised by Pesca, and to be therefore in danger of his
life? If I could get speech of him that night, if I could show him that
I, too, knew of the mortal peril in which he stood, what result would follow?
Plainly this. One of us must be master of the situation -- one of us must
inevitably be at the mercy of the other.

<P>I owed it to myself to consider the chances against me before I confronted
them. I owed it to my wife to do all that lay in my power to lessen the
risk.

<P>The chances against me wanted no reckoning up -- they were all merged
in one- If the Count discovered, by my own avowal, that the direct way
to his safety lay through my life, he was probably the last man in existence
who would shrink from throwing me off my guard and taking that way, when
he had me alone within his reach. The only means of defence against him
on which I could at all rely to lessen the risk, presented themselves,
after a little careful thinking, clearly enough. Before I made any personal
acknowledgment of my discovery in his presence, I must place the discovery
itself where it would be ready for instant use against him, and safe from
any attempt at suppression on his part. If I laid the mine under his feet
before I approached him, and if I left instructions with a third person
to fire it on the expiration of a certain time, unless directions to the
contrary were previously received under my own hand, or from my own lips
-- in that event the Count's security was absolutely dependent upon mine,
and I might hold the vantage ground over him securely, even in his own
house.

<P>This idea occurred to me when I was close to the new lodgings which
we had taken on returning from the sea-side. I went in without disturbing
any one, by the help of my key. A light was in the hall, and I stole up
with it to my workroom to make my preparations, and absolutely to commit
myself to an interview with the Count, before either Laura or Marian could
have the slightest suspicion of what I intended to do.

<P>A letter addressed to Pesca represented the surest measure of precaution
which it was now possible for me to take. I wrote as follows --

<P>`The man whom I pointed out to you at the Opera is a member of the Brotherhood,
and has been false to his Lust put both these assertions to the test instantly.
You know the name he goes by in England. His address is No. 5 Forest Road,
St John's Wood. On the love you once bore me, use the power entrusted to
you without mercy and without delay against that man. I have risked all
and lost all -- and the forfeit of my failure has been paid with my life.'

<P>I signed and dated these lines, enclosed them in an envelope, and sealed
it up. On the outside I wrote this direction: `Keep the enclosure unopened
until nine o'clock tomorrow morning. If you do not hear from me, or see
me, before that time, break the seal when the clock strikes, and read the
contents.' I added my initials, and protected the whole by enclosing it
in a second sealed envelope, addressed to Pesca at his lodgings.

<P>Nothing remained to be done after this but to find the means of sending
my letter to its destination immediately. I should then have accomplished
all that lay in my power. &amp; anything happened to me in the Count's
house, I had now provided for his answering it with his life.

<P>That the means of preventing his escape, under any circumstances whatever,
were at Pesca's disposal, if he chose to exert them, I did not for an instant
doubt. The extraordinary anxiety which he had expressed to remain unenlightened
as to the Count's identity -- or, in other words, to be left uncertain
enough about facts to justify him to his own conscience in remaining passive
-- betrayed plainly that the means of exercising the terrible justice of
the Brotherhood were ready to his hand, although, as a naturally humane
man, he had shrunk from plainly saying as much in my presence. The deadly
certainty with which the vengeance of foreign political societies can hunt
down a traitor to the cause, hide himself where he may, had been too often
exemplified, even in my superficial experience, to allow of any doubt.
Considering the subject only as a reader of newspapers, cases recurred
to my memory, both in London and in Paris, of foreigners found stabbed
in the streets, whose assassins could never be traced -- of bodies and
parts of bodies thrown into the Thames and the Seine, by hands that could
never be discovered -- of deaths by secret violence which could only be
accounted for in one way. I have disguised nothing relating to myself in
these pages, and I do not disguise here that I believed I had written Count
Fosco's death-warrant, if the fatal emergency happened which authorised
Pesca to open my enclosure.

<P>I left my room to go down to the ground floor of the house, and speak
to the landlord about finding me a messenger. He happened to be ascending
the stairs at the time, and we met on the landing. His son, a quick lad,
was the messenger he proposed to me on hearing what I wanted. We had the
boy upstairs, and I gave him his directions. He was to take the letter
in a cab, to put it into Professor Pesca's own hands, and to bring me back
a line of acknowledgment from that gentleman -- returning in the cab, and
keeping it at the door for my use. It was then nearly half-past ten. I
calculated that the boy might be back in twenty minutes, and that I might
drive to St John's Wood, on his return, in twenty minutes more.

<P>When the lad had departed on his errand I returned to my own room for
a little while, to put certain papers in order, so that they might be easily
found in case of the worst. The key of the old-fashioned bureau in which
the papers were kept I sealed up, and left it on my table, with Marian's
name written on the outside of the little packet. This done, I went downstairs
to the sitting-room, in which I expected to find Laura and Marian awaiting
my return from the Opera. I felt my hand trembling for the first time when
I laid it on the lock of the door.

<P>No one was in the room but Marian. She was reading, and she looked at
her watch, in surprise, when I came in.

<P>`How early you are back!'' she said. `You must have come away before
the Opera was over.'

<P>`Yes,' I replied, `neither Pesca nor I waited for the end. Where is
Laura?'

<P>`She had one of her bad headaches this evening, and I advised her to
go to bed when we had done tea.'

<P>I left the room again on the pretext of wishing to see whether Laura
was asleep. Marian's quick eyes were beginning to look inquiringly at my
face -- Marian's quick instinct was beginning to discover that I had something
weighing on my mind.

<P>When I entered the bedchamber, and softly approached the bedside by
the dim flicker of the night-lamp, my wife was asleep.

<P>We had not been married quite a month yet. If my heart was heavy, if
my resolution for a moment faltered again, when I looked at her face turned
faithfully to my pillow in her sleep -- when I saw her hand resting open
on the coverlid, as if it was waiting unconsciously for mine -- surely
there was some excuse for me? I only allowed myself a few minutes to kneel
down at the bedside, and to look close at her -- so close that her breath,
as it came and went, fluttered on my face. I only touched her hand and
her cheek with my lips at parting. She stirred in her sleep and murmured
my name, but without waking. I lingered for an instant at the door to look
at her again. `God bless and keep you, my darling!' I whispered, and left
her.

<P>Marian was at the stairhead waiting for me. She had a folded slip of
paper in her hand.

<P>`The landlord's son has brought this for you,' she said. `He has got
a cab at the door -- he says you ordered him to keep it at your disposal.'

<P>`Quite right, Marian. I want the cab -- I am going out again.'

<P>I descended the stairs as I spoke, and looked into the sitting-room
to read the slip of paper by the light on the table. It contained these
two sentences in Pesca's handwriting --

<P>`Your letter is received. If I don't see you before the time you mention,
I will break the seal when the clock strikes.'

<P>I placed the paper in my pocket-book, and made for the door. Marian
met me on the threshold, and pushed me hack into the room, where the candle-light
fell full on my face. She held me by both hands, and her eyes fastened
searchingly on mine.

<P>`I see!' she said, in a low eager whisper. `You are trying the last
chance tonight.'

<P>`Yes, the last chance and the best,' I whispered back.

<P>`Not alone! Oh, Walter, for God's sake, not alone! Let me go with you.
Don't refuse me because I'm only a woman. I must go! I will go! I'll wait
outside in the cab!'

<P>It was my turn now to hold her. She tried to break away from me and
get down first to the door.

<P>`If you want to help me,' I said, `stop here and sleep in my wife's
room tonight. Only let me go away with my mind easy about Laura, and I
answer for everything else. Come, Marian, give me a kiss, and show that
you have the courage to wait till I come back.'

<P>I dared not allow her time to say a word more. She tried to hold me
again. I unclasped her hands, and was out of the room in a moment. The
boy below heard me on the stairs, and opened the hall-door. I jumped into
the cab before the driver could get off the box. `Forest Road, St John's
Wood,' I called to him through the front window. `Double fare if you get
there in a quarter of an hour.' `I'll do it, sir.' I looked at my watch.
Eleven o'clock. Not a minute to lose.

<P>The rapid motion of the cab, the sense that every instant now was bringing
me nearer to the Count, the conviction that I was embarked at last, without
let or hindrance, on my hazardous enterprise, heated me into such a fever
of excitement that I shouted to the man to go faster and faster. As we
left the streets, and crossed St John's Wood Road, my impatience so completely
overpowered me that I stood up in the cab and stretched my head out of
the window, to see the end of the journey before we reached it. Just as
a church clock in the distance struck the quarter past, we turned into
the Forest Road. I stopped the driver a little away from the Count's house,
paid and dismissed him, and walked on to the door.

<P>As I approached the garden gate, I saw another person advancing towards
it also from the direction opposite to mine. We met under the gas lamp
in the road, and looked at each other. I instantly recognised the light-haired
foreigner with the scar on his cheek, and i thought he recognised <I>me.</I>
He said nothing, and instead of stopping at the house, as I did, he slowly
walked on. Was he in the Forest Road by accident? Or had he followed the
Count home from the Opera?

<P>I did not pursue those questions. After waiting a little till the foreigner
had slowly passed out of sight, I rang the gate bell. It was then twenty
minutes past eleven -- late enough to make it quite easy for the Count
to get rid of me by the excuse that he was in bed.

<P>The only way of providing against this contingency was to send in my
name without asking any preliminary questions, and to let him know, at
the same time, that I had a serious motive for wishing to see him at that
late hour. Accordingly, while I was waiting, I took out my card and wrote
under my name `On important business.' The maid-servant answered the door
while I was writing the last word in pencil, and asked me distrustfully
what I `pleased to want.'

<P>`Be so good as to take that to your master,' I replied, giving her the
card.

<P>I saw, by the girl's hesitation of manner, that if I had asked for the
Count in the first instance she would only have followed her instructions
by telling me he was not at home. She was staggered by the confidence with
which I gave her the card. After staring at me, in great perturbation,
she went back into the house with my message, closing the door, and leaving
me to wait in the garden.

<P>In a minute or so she reappeared. `Her master's compliments, and would
I be so obliging as to say what my business was?' `Take my compliments
hack,' I replied, `and say that the business cannot be mentioned to any
one but your master.' She left me again, again returned, and this time
asked me to walk in.

<P>I followed her at once. In another moment I was inside the Count's house.

<P>There was no lamp in the hall, but by the dim light of the kitchen candle,
which the girl had brought upstairs with her, I saw an elderly lady steal
noiselessly out of a back room on the ground floor. She cast one viperish
look at me as I entered the hall, but said nothing, and went slowly upstairs
without returning my bow. My familiarity with Marian's journal sufficiently
assured me that the elderly lady was Madame Fosco.

<P>The servant led me to the room which the Countess had just left. I entered
it, and found myself face to face with the Count.

<P>He was still in his evening dress, except his coat, which he had thrown
across a chair. His shirt-sleeves were turned up at the wrists, but no
higher. A carpet-bag was on one side of him, and a box on the other. Books,
papers, and articles of wearing apparel were scattered about the room.
On a table, at one side of the door, stood the cage, so well known to me
by description, which contained his white mice. The canaries and the cockatoo
were probably in some other room. He was seated before the box, packing
it, when I went in, and rose with some papers in his hand to receive me.
His face still betrayed plain traces of the shock that had overwhelmed
him at the Opera. His fat cheeks hung loose, his cold grey eyes were furtively
vigilant, his voice, look, and manner were all sharPly suspicious alike,
as he advanced a step to meet me, and requested, with distant civility,
that I would take a chair.

<P>`You come here on business, sir?' he said. `I am at a loss to know what
that business can possibly be.'

<P>The unconcealed curiosity, with which he looked hard in my face while
he spoke, convinced me that I had passed unnoticed by him at the Opera.
He had seen Pesca first, and from that moment till he left the theatre
he had evidently seen nothing else. My name would necessarily suggest to
him that I had not come into his house with other than a hostile purpose
towards himself, but he appeared to be utterly ignorant thus far of the
real nature of my errand.

<P>`I am fortunate in finding you here tonight,' I said. `You seem to be
on the point of taking a journey?'

<P>`Is your business connected with my journey?'

<P>`In some degree.'

<P>`In what degree? Do you know where I am going to?'

<P>`No. I only know why you are leaving London.'

<P>He slipped by me with the quickness of thought, locked the door, and
put the key in his pocket.

<P>`You and I, Mr Hartright, are excellently well acquainted with one another
by reputation,' he said. `Did it, by any chance, occur to you when you
came to this house that I was not the sort of man you could trifle with?'

<P>`It did occur to me,' I replied. `And I have not come to trifle with
you. I am here on a matter of life and death, and if that door which you
have locked was open at this moment, nothing you could say or do would
induce me to pass through it.'

<P>I walked farther into the room, and stood opposite to him on the rug
before the fireplace. He drew a chair in front of the door, and sat down
on it, with his left arm resting on the table. The cage with the white
mice was close to him, and the little creatures scampered out of their
sleeping-place as his heavy arm shook the table, and peered at him through
the gaps in the smartly painted wires.

<P>`On a matter of-life and death,' he repeated to himself. `Those words
are more serious, perhaps, than you think. What do you mean?'

<P>`What I say.'

<P>The perspiration broke out thickly on his broad forehead. His left hand
stole over the edge of the table. There was a drawer in it, with a lock,
and the key was in the lock. His finger and thumb closed over the key,
but did not turn it.

<P>`So you know why I am leaving London?' he went on. `Tell me the reason,
if you please.' He turned the key, and unlocked the drawer as he spoke.

<P>`I can do better than that,' I replied. `I can show you the reason,
if you like.'

<P>`How can you show it?'

<P>`You have got your coat off,' I said. `Roll up the shirtsleeve on your
left arm, and you will see it there.'

<P>The same livid leaden change passed over his face which I had seen pass
over it at the theatre. The deadly glitter in his eyes shone steady and
straight into mine. He said nothing. But his left hand slowly opened the
table-drawer, and softly slipped into it. The harsh grating noise of something
heavy that he was moving unseen to me sounded for a moment, then ceased.
The silence that followed was so intense that the faint ticking nibble
of the white mice at their wires was distinctly audible where I stood.

<P>My life hung by a thread, and I knew it. At that final moment I thought
with his mind, I felt with his fingers -- I was as certain as if I had
seen to it what he kept hidden from me in the drawer.

<P>`Wait a little,' I said. `You have got the door locked -- you see I
don't move -- you see my hands are empty. Wait a little. I have something
more to say.'

<P>`You have said enough,' he replied, with a sudden composure so unnatural
and so ghastly that it tried my nerves as no outbreak of violence could
have tried them. `I want one moment for my own thoughts, if you please.
Do you guess what I am thinking about?'

<P>`Perhaps I do.'

<P>`I am thinking,' he remarked quietly, `whether I shall add to the disorder
in this room by scattering your brains about the fireplace.'

<P>If I had moved at that moment, I saw in his face that he would have
done it.

<P>`I advise you to read two lines of writing which I have about me,' I
rejoined, `before you finally decide that question.'

<P>The proposal appeared to excite his curiosity. He nodded his head. I
took Pesca's acknowledgment of the receipt of my letter out of my pocket-book,
handed it to him at arm's length, and returned to my former position in
front of the fireplace.

<P>He read the lines aloud: Your letter is received. If I don't hear from
you before the time you mention, I will break the seal when the clock strikes.'

<P>Another man in his position would have needed some explanation of those
words -- the Count felt no such necessity. One reading of the note showed
him the precaution that I had taken as plainly as if he had been present
at the time when I adopted it. The expression of his face changed on the
instant, and his hand came out of the drawer empty.

<P>`I don't lock up my drawer, Mr Hartright,' he said, `and I don't say
that I may not scatter your brains about the fireplace yet. But I am a
just man even to my enemy, and I will acknowledge beforehand that they
are cleverer brains than I thought them. Come to the point, sir! You want
something of me?'

<P>`I do, and I mean to have it.'

<P>`On conditions?'

<P>`On no conditions.'

<P>His hand dropped into the drawer again.

<P>`Bah! we are travelling in a circle,' he said, `and those clever brains
of yours are in danger again. Your tone is deplorably imprudent, sir --
moderate it on the spot! The risk of shooting you on the place where you
stand is less to <I>me</I> than the risk of letting you out of this house,
except on conditions that I dictate and approve. You have not got my lamented
friend to deal with now -- you are face to face with Fosco! If the lives
of twenty Mr Hartrights' were the stepping-stones to my safety, over all
those stones I would go, sustained by my sublime indifference, self-balanced
by my impenetrable calm. Respect me, if you love your own life! I summon
you to answer three questions before you open your lips again. Hear them
-- they are necessary to this interview. Answer them -- they are necessary
to ME.' He held up one finger of his right hand. `First question!' he said.
`You come here possessed of information which may be true or may be false
-- where did you get it?'

<P>`I decline to tell you.'

<P>`No matter -- I shall find out. If that information is true -- mind
I say, with the whole force of my resolution, if -- you are making your
market of it here by treachery of your own or by treachery of some other
man. I note that circumstance for future use in my memory, which forgets
nothing, and proceed.' He held up another finger. `Second question! Those
lines you invited me to read are without signature. Who wrote them?'

<P>`A man whom <I>I</I> have every reason to depend on, and whom <I>you</I>
have every reason to fear.'

<P>My answer reached him to some purpose. His left hand trembled audibly
in the drawer. `How long do you give me,' he asked, putting his third question
in a quieter tone, `before the clock strikes and the seal is broken?'

<P>`Time enough for you to come to my terms,' I replied.

<P>`Give me a plainer answer, Mr Hartright. What hour is the clock to strike?'

<P>`Nine, tomorrow morning.'

<P>`Nine, tomorrow morning? Yes, yes -- your trap is laid for me before
I can get my passport regulated and leave London. It is not earlier, I
suppose? We will see about that presently -- I can keep you hostage here,
and bargain with you to send for your letter before I let you go. In the
meantime, be so good next as to mention your terms.'

<P>`You shall hear them. They are simple, and soon stated. You know whose
interests I represent in coming here?'

<P>He smiled with the most supreme composure, and carelessly waved his
right hand.

<P>`I consent to hazard a guess,' he said jeeringly. `A lady's interests,
of course!'

<P>`My Wife's interests.'

<P>He looked at me with the first honest expression that had crossed his
face in my presence -- an expression of blank amazement. I could see that
I sank in his estimation as a dangerous man from that moment. He shut up
the drawer at once, folded his arms over his breast, and listened to me
with a smile of satirical attention.

<P>`You are well enough aware,' I went on, `of the course which my inquiries
have taken for many months past, to know that any attempted denial of plain
facts will be quite useless in my presence. You are guilty of an infamous
conspiracy I And the gain of a fortune of ten thousand pounds was your
motive for it.'

<P>He said nothing. But his face became overclouded suddenly by a lowering
anxiety.

<P>`Keep your gain,' I said. (His face lightened again immediately, and
his eyes opened on me in wider and wider astonishment.) `I am not here
to disgrace myself by bargaining for money which has passed through your
hands, and which has been the price of a vile crime.'

<P>`Gently, Mr Hartright. Your moral clap-traps have an excellent effect
in England -- keep them for yourself and your own countrymen, if you please.
The ten thousand pounds was a legacy left to my excellent wife by the late
Mr Fairlie. Place the affair on those grounds, and I will discuss it if
you like. To a man of my sentiments, however, the subject is deplorably
sordid. I prefer to pass it over. I invite you to resume the discussion
of your terms. What do you demand?'

<P>`In the first place, I demand a full confession of the conspiracy, written
and signed in my presence by yourself.'

<P>He raised his finger again. `One!' he said, checking me off with the
steady attention of a practical man.

<P>`In the second place, I demand a plain proof, which does not depend
on your personal asseveration, of the date at which my wife left Blackwater
Park and travelled to London.'

<P>`So! so! you can lay your finger, I see, on the weak place,' he remarked
composedly. `Any more?'

<P>`At present, no more.'

<P>`Good! you have mentioned your terms, now listen to mine. The responsibility
to myself of admitting what you are pleased to call the ``conspiracy''
is less, perhaps, upon the whole, than the responsibility of laying you
dead on that hearthrug. Let us say that I meet your proposal -- on my own
conditions. The statement you demand of me shall be written, and the plain
proof shall be produced. You call a letter from my late lamented friend
informing me of the day and hour of his wife's arrival in London, written,
signed, and dated by himself, a proof, I suppose? I can give you this.
I can also send you to the man of whom I hired the carriage to fetch my
visitor from the railway, on the day when she arrived -- his order-book
may help you to your date, even if his coachman who drove me proves to
be of no use. These things I can do, and will do, on conditions. I recite
them. First condition! Madame Fosco and I leave this house when and how
we please, without interference of any kind on your part. Second condition
I You wait here, in company with me, to see my agent, who is coming at
seven o'clock in the morning to regulate my affairs. You give my agent
a written order to the man who has got your sealed letter to resign his
possession of it. You wait here till my agent places that letter unopened
in my hands, and you then allow me one clear half-hour to leave the house
-- after which you resume your own freedom of action and go where you please.
Third condition! You give me the satisfaction of a gentleman for your intrusion
into my private affairs, and for the language you have allowed yourself
to use to me at this conference. The time and place, abroad, to be fixed
in a letter from my hand when I am safe on the Continent, and that letter
to contain a strip of paper measuring accurately the length of my sword.
Those are my terms. Inform me if you accept them -- Yes or No.'

<P>The extraordinary mixture of prompt decision, far-sighted cunning, and
mountebank bravado in this speech, staggered me for a moment -- and only
for a moment. The one question to consider was, whether I was justified
or not in possessing myself of the means of establishing Laura's identity
at the cost of allowing the scoundrel who had robbed her of it to escape
me with impunity. I knew that the motive of securing the just recognition
of my wife in the birthplace from which she had been driven out as an imposter,
and of publicly erasing the lie that still profaned her mother's tombstone,
was far purer, in its freedom from all taint of evil passion, than the
vindictive motive which had mingled itself with my purpose from the first.
And yet I cannot honestly say that my own moral convictions were strong
enough to decide the struggle in me by themselves. They were helped by
my remembrance of Sir Percival's death. How awfully, at the last moment,
had the working of the retribution there been snatched from my feeble hands
I What right had I to decide, in my poor mortal ignorance of the future,
that this man, too, must escape with impunity because he escaped <I>me</I>?
I thought of these things -- perhaps with the superstition inherent in
my nature, perhaps with a sense worthier of me than superstition. It was
hard, when I had fastened my hold on him at last, to loosen it again of
my own accord -- but I forced myself to make the sacrifice. In plainer
words, I determined to be guided by the one higher motive of which I was
certain, the motive of serving the cause of Laura and the cause of Truth.

<P>`I accept your conditions,' I said. `With one reservation on my part.'

<P>`What reservation may that be?' he asked.

<P>`It refers to the sealed letter,' I answered. `I require you to destroy
it unopened in my presence as soon as it is placed in your hands.'

<P>My object in making this stipulation was simPly to prevent him from
carrying away written evidence of the nature of my communication with Pesca.
The fact of my communication he would necessarily discover, when I gave
the address to his agent in the morning. But he could make no use of it
on his own unsupported testimony -- even if he really ventured to try the
experiment -- which need excite in me the slightest apprehension on Pesca's
account.

<P>`I grant your reservation,' he replied, after considering the question
gravely for a minute or two. `It is not worth dispute -- the letter shall
be destroyed when it comes into my hands.'

<P>He rose, as he spoke, from the chair in which he had been sitting opposite
to me up to this time. With one effort he appeared to free his mind from
the whole pressure on it of the interview between us thus far. `Ouf!' he
cried, stretching his arms luxuriously, `the skirmish was hot while it
lasted. Take a seat, Mr Hartright. We meet as mortal enemies hereafter
-- let us, like gallant gentlemen, exchange polite attentions in the meantime.
Permit me to take the liberty of calling for my wife.'

<P>He unlocked and opened the door. `Eleanor!' he called out in his deep
voice. The lady of the viperish face came in. `Madame Fosco -- Mr Hartright,'
said the Count, introducing us with easy dignity. `My angel,' he went on,
addressing his wife, `will your labours of packing up allow you time to
make me some nice strong coffee? I have writing business to transact with
Mr Hartright -- and I require the full possession of my intelligence to
do justice to myself.'

<P>Madame Fosco bowed her head twice -- once sternly to me, once submissively
to her husband -- and glided out of the room.

<P>The Count walked to a writing-table near the window, opened his desk,
and took from it several quires of paper and a bundle of quill pens. He
scattered the pens about the table, so that they might lie ready in all
directions to be taken up when wanted, and then cut the paper into a heap
of narrow slips, of the form used by professional writers for the press.
`I shall make this a remarkable document,' he said, looking at me over
his shoulder. `Habits of literary composition are perfectly familiar to
me. One of the rarest of all the intellectual accomplishments that a man
can possess is the grand faculty of arranging his ideas. Immense privilege!
I possess it. Do you?'

<P>He marched backwards and forwards in the room, until the coffee appeared,
humming to himself, and marking the places at which obstacles occurred
in the arrangement of his ideas, by striking his forehead from time to
time with the palm of his hand. The enormous audacity with which he seized
on the situation in which I placed him, and made it the pedestal on which
his vanity mounted for the one cherished purpose of self-display, mastered
my astonishment by main force. Sincerely as I loathed the man, the prodigious
strength of his character, even in its most trivial aspects, impressed
me in spite of myself.

<P>The coffee was brought in by Madame Fosco. He kissed her hand in grateful
acknowledgment, and escorted her to the door; returned, poured out a cup
of coffee for himself, and took it to the writing-table.

<P>`May I offer you some coffee, Mr Hartright?' he said, before he sat
down.

<P>I declined.

<P>`What! you think I shall poison you?' he said gaily. `The English intellect
is sound, so far as it goes,' he continued, seating himself at the table:
`but it has one grave defect -- it is always cautious in the wrong place.'

<P>He dipped his pen in the ink, placed the fist slip of paper before him
with a thump of his hand on the desk, cleared his throat, and began. He
wrote with great noise and rapidity, in so large and bold a hand, and with
such wide spaces between the lines, that he reached the bottom of the slip
in not more than two minutes certainly from the time when he started at
the top. Each slip as he finished it was paged, and tossed over his shoulder
out of his way on the floor. When his first pen was worn out, that went
over his shoulder too, and he pounced on a second from the supply scattered
about the table. Slip after slip, by dozens, by fifties, by hundreds, flew
over his shoulders on either side of him till he had snowed himself up
in paper all round his chair. Hour after hour passed -- and there I sat
watching, there he sat writing. He never stopped, except to sip his coffee,
and when that was exhausted, to smack his forehead from time to time. One
o'clock struck, two, three, four -- and still the slips flew about all
round him; still the untiring pen scraped its way ceaselessly from top
to bottom of the page, still the white chaos of paper rose higher and higher
all round his chair. At four o'clock I heard a sudden splutter of the pen,
indicative of the flourish with which he signed his name. `Bravo!' he cried,
springing to his feet with the activity of a young man, and looking me
straight in the face with a smile of superb triumph.

<P>`Done, Mr Hartright!' he announced with a self-renovating thump of his
fist on his broad chest. `Done, to my own profound satisfaction -- to <I>your</I>
profound astonishment, when you read what I have written. The subject is
exhausted : the man -- Fosco -- is not. I proceed to the arrangement of
my slips -- to the revision of my slips -- to the reading of my slips --
addressed emphatically to your private ear. Four o'clock has just struck.
Good! Arrangement, revision, reading, from four to five. Short snooze of
restoration for myself from five to six. Final preparations from six to
seven. Affair of agent and sealed letter from seven to eight. At eight,
<I>en route.</I> Behold the programme!'

<P>He sat down cross-legged on the floor among his papers, strung them
together with a bodkin and a piece of string -- revised them, wrote all
the titles and honours by which he was personally distinguished at the
head of the first page, and then read the manuscript to me with loud theatrical
emphasis and profuse theatrical gesticulation. The reader will have an
opportunity, ere long, of forming his own opinion of the document. It will
be sufficient to mention here that it answered my purpose.

<P>He next wrote me the address of the person from whom he had hired the
fly, and handed me Sir Percival's letter. It was dated from Hampshire on
the 25th of July, and it announced the journey of `Lady Glyde' to London
on the 26th. Thus, on the very day (the 25th) when the doctor's certificate
declared that she had died in St John's Wood, she was alive, by Sir Percival's
own showing, at Blackwater -- and, on the day after, she was to take a
journey! When the proof of that journey was obtained from the flyman, the
evidence would be complete.

<P>`A quarter-past five,' said the Count, looking at his watch. `Time for
my restorative snooze. I personally resemble Napoleon the Great, as you
may have remarked, Mr Hartright -- I also resemble that immortal man in
my power of commanding sleep at will. Excuse me one moment. I will summon
Madame Fosco, to keep you from feeling dull.'

<P>Knowing as well as he did, that he was summoning Madame Fosco to ensure
my not leaving the house while he was asleep, I made no reply, and occupied
myself in tying up the papers which he had placed in my possession.

<P>The lady came in, cool, pale, and venomous as ever. `Amuse Mr Hartright,
my angel,' said the Count. He placed a chair for her, kissed her hand for
the second time, withdrew to a sofa, and, in three minutes, was as peaceful
and happily asleep as the most virtuous man in existence.

<P>Madame Fosco took a book from the table, sat down, and looked at me,
with the steady vindictive malice of a woman who never forgot and never
forgave.

<P>`I have been listening to your conversation with my husband,' she said.
`If I had been in his place -- <I>I</I> would have laid you dead on the
hearthrug.'

<P>With those words she opened her book, and never looked at me or spoke
to me from that time till the time when her husband woke.

<P>He opened his eyes and rose from the sofa, accurately to an hour from
the time when he had gone to sleep.

<P>`I feel infinitely refreshed,' he remarked. `Eleanor, my good wife,
are you all ready upstairs? That is well. My little packing here can be
completed in ten minutes -- my travelling-dress assumed in ten minutes
more. What remains before the agent comes?' He looked about the room, and
noticed the cage with his white mice in it. `Ah!' he cried piteously, `a
last laceration of my sympathies still remains. My innocent pets! my little
cherished children! what am I to do with them? For the present we are settled
nowhere; for the present we travel incessantly -- the less baggage we carry
the better for ourselves. My cockatoo, my canaries, and my little mice
-- who will cherish them when their good Papa is gone?'

<P>He walked about the room deep in thought. He had not been at all troubled
about writing his confession, but he was visibly perplexed and distressed
about the far more important question of the disposal of his pets. After
long consideration he suddenly sat down again at the writing-table.

<P>`An idea!' he exclaimed. `I will offer my canaries and my cockatoo to
this vast Metropolis -- my agent shall present them in my name to the Zoological
Gardens of London. The Document that describes them shall be drawn out
on the spot.'

<P>He began to write, repeating the words as they flowed from his pen.

<P>`Number one. Cockatoo of transcendent plumage: attraction, of himself,
to all visitors of taste. Number two. Canaries of unrivalled vivacity and
intelligence: worthy of the garden of Eden, worthy also of the garden in
the Regent's Park. Homage to British Zoology. Offered by Fosco.'

<P>The pen spluttered again, and the flourish was attached to his signature.

<P>`Count! you have not included the mice,' said Madame Fosco.

<P>He left the table, took her hand, and placed it on his heart.

<P>`All human resolution, Eleanor,' he said solemnly, `has its limits.
My limits are inscribed in that Document. I cannot part with my white mice.
Bear with me, my angel, and remove them to their travelling cage upstairs.'

<P>`Admirable tenderness!' said Madame Fosco, admiring her husband, with
a last viperish look in my direction. She took up the cage carefully, and
left the room.

<P>The Count looked at his watch. In spite of his resolute assumption of
composure, he was getting anxious for the agent's arrival. The candles
had long since been extinguished, and the sunlight of the new morning poured
into the room. It was not till five minutes past seven that the gate bell
rang, and the agent made his appearance. He was a foreigner with a dark
beard.

<P>`Mr Hartright -- Monsieur Rubelle,' said the Count, introducing us.
He took the agent (a foreign spy, in every line of his face, if ever there
was one yet) into a corner of the room, whispered some directions to him,
and then left us together. `Monsieur Rubelle,' as soon as we were alone,
suggested with great politeness that I should favour him with his instructions.
I wrote two lines to Pesca, authorising him to deliver my sealed letter
`to the bearer,' directed the note, and handed it to Monsieur Rubelle.

<P>The agent waited with me till his employer returned, equipped in travelling
costume. The Count examined the address of my letter before he dismissed
the agent. `I thought so!' he said, turning on me with a dark look, and
altering again in his manner from that moment.

<P>He completed his packing, and then sat consulting a travelling map,
making entries in his pocket-book, and looking every now and then impatiently
at his watch. Not another word, addressed to myself, passed his lips. The
near approach of the hour for his departure, and the proof he had seen
of the communication established between Pesca and myself, had plainly
recalled his whole attention to the measures that were necessary for securing
his escape.

<P>A little before eight o'clock, Monsieur Rubelle came back with my unopened
letter in his hand. The Count looked carefully at the superscription and
the seal, lit a candle, and burnt the letter. `I perform my promise,' he
said, `but this matter, Mr Hartright, shall not end here.'

<P>The agent had kept at the door the cab in which he had returned. He
and the maid-servant now busied themselves in removing the luggage. Madame
Fosco came downstairs, thickly veiled, with the travelling cage of the
white mice in her hand. She neither spoke to me nor looked towards me.
Her husband escorted her to the cab. `Follow me as far as the passage,'
he whispered in my ear; `I may want to speak to you at the last moment.'

<P>I went out to the door, the agent standing below me in the front garden.
The Count came back alone, and drew me a few steps inside the passage.

<P>`Remember the Third condition!' he whispered. `You shall hear from me,
Mr Hartright -- I may claim from you the satisfaction of a gentleman sooner
than you think for.' He caught my hand before I was aware of him, and wrung
It hard -- then turned to the door, stopped, and came back to me again.

<P>`One word more,' he said confidentially. `When I last saw Miss Halcombe,
she looked thin and ill. I am anxious about that admirable woman. Take
care of her, sir! With my hand on my heart, I solemnly implore you, take
care of Miss Halcombe!'

<P>Those were the last words he said to me before he squeezed his huge
body into the cab and drove off.

<P>The agent and I waited at the door a few moments looking after him.
While we were standing together, a second cab appeared from a turning a
little way down the road. It followed the direction previously taken by
the Count's cab, and as it passed the house and the open garden gate, a
person inside looked at us out of the window. The stranger at the Opera
again! -- the foreigner with a scar on his left cheek.

<P>`You wait here with me, sir, for half an hour more!' said Monsieur Rubelle.

<P>`I do.'

<P>We returned to the sitting-room. I was in no humour to speak to the
agent, or to allow him to speak to me. I took out the papers which the
Count had placed in my hands, and read the terrible story of the conspiracy
told by the man who had planned and perpetrated it.
