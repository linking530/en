THE STORY CONTINUED BY VINCENT GILMORE (of Chancery Lane, Solicitor)</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H2>
I</H2></CENTER>
I WRITE these lines at the request of my friend, Mr Walter Hartright. They
are intended to convey a description of certain events which seriously
affected Miss Fairlie's interests, and which took place after the period
of Mr Hartright's departure from Limmeridge House.

<P>There is no need for me to say whether my own opinion does or does not
sanction the disclosure of the remarkable family story, of which my narrative
forms an important component part. Mr Hartright has taken that responsibility
on himself, and circumstances yet to be related will show that he has amply
earned the right to do so, if he chooses to exercise it. The plan he has
adopted for presenting the story to others, in the most truthful and most
vivid manner, requires that it should be told, at each successive stage
in the march of events, by the persons who were directly concerned in those
events at the time of their occurrence. My appearance here, as narrator,
is the necessary consequence of this arrangement. I was present during
the sojourn of Sir Percival Glyde in Cumberland, and was personally concerned
in one important result of his short residence under Mr Fairlie's roof.
It is my duty, therefore, to add these new links to the chain of events,
and to take up the chain itself at the point where, for the present only,
Mr Hartright has dropped it.

<P>I arrived at Limmeridge House on Friday the second of November.

<P>My object was to remain at Mr Fairlie's until the arrival of Sir Percival
Glyde. If that event led to the appointment of any given day for Sir Percival's
union with Miss Fairlie, I was to take the necessary instructions back
with me to London, and to occupy myself in drawing the lady's marriage-settlement.

<P>On the Friday I was not favoured by Mr Fairlie with an interview. He
had been, or had fancied himself to be, an invalid for years past, and
he was not well enough to receive me. Miss Halcombe was the first member
of the family whom I saw. She met me at the house door, and introduced
me to Mr Hartright, who had been staying at Limmeridge for some time past.

<P>I did not see Miss Fairlie until later in the day, at dinner-time. She
was not looking well, and I was sorry to observe it. She is a sweet lovable
girl, as amiable and attentive to every one about her as her excellent
mother used to be -- though, personally speaking, she takes after her father.
Mrs Fairlie had dark eyes and hair, and her elder daughter, Miss Halcombe,
strongly reminds me of her. Miss Fairlie played to us in the evening --
not so well as usual, I thought. We had a rubber at whist, a mere profanation,
so far as play was concerned, of that noble game. I had been favourably
impressed by Mr Hartright on our first introduction to one another, but
I soon discovered that he was not free from the social failings incidental
to his age. There are three things that none of the young men of the present
generation can do. They can't sit over their wine, they can't play at whist,
and they can't pay a lady a compliment. Mr Hartright was no exception to
the general rule. Otherwise, even in those early days and on that short
acquaintance, he struck me as being a modest and gentlemanlike young man.

<P>So the Friday passed. I say nothing about the more serious matters which
engaged my attention on that day -- the anonymous letter to Miss Fairlie,
the measures I thought it right to adopt when the matter was mentioned
to me, and the conviction I entertained that every possible explanation
of the circumstances would be readily afforded by Sir Percival Glyde, having
all been fully noticed, as I understand, in the narrative which precedes
this.

<P>On the Saturday Mr Hartright had left before I got down to breakfast.
Miss Fairlie kept her room all day, and Miss Halcombe appeared to me to
be out of spirits. The house was not what it used to be in the time of
Mr and Mrs Philip Fairlie. I took a walk by myself in the forenoon, and
looked about at some of the places which I first saw when I was staying
at Limmeridge to transact family business, more than thirty years since.
They were not what they used to be either.

<P>At two o'clock Mr Fairlie sent to say he was well enough to see me.
He had not altered, at any rate, since I first knew him. His talk was to
the same purpose as usual -- all about himself and his ailments, his wonderful
coins, and his matchless Rembrandt etchings. The moment I tried to speak
of the business that had brought me to his house, he shut his eyes and
said I `upset' him. I persisted in upsetting him by returning again and
again to the subject. All I could ascertain was that he looked on his niece's
marriage as a settled thing, that her father had sanctioned it, that he
sanctioned it himself, that it was a desirable marriage, and that he should
be personally rejoiced when the worry of it was over. As to the settlements,
if I would consult his niece, and afterwards dive as deeply as I pleased
into my own knowledge of the family affairs, and get everything ready,
and limit his share in the business, as guardian, to saying Yes, at the
right moment -- why, of course he would meet my views, and everybody else's
views, with infinite pleasure. In the meantime, there I saw him, a helpless
sufferer, confined to his room. Did I think he looked as if he wanted teasing?
No. Then why tease him?

<P>I might, perhaps, have been a little astonished at this extraordinary
absence of all self-assertion on Mr Fairlie's part, in the character of
guardian, if my knowledge of the family affairs had not been sufficient
to remind me that he was a single man, and that he had nothing more than
a life-interest in the Limmeridge property. As matters stood, therefore,
I was neither surprised nor disappointed at the result of the interview.
Mr Fairlie had simply justified my expectations -- and there was an end
of it.

<P>Sunday was a dull day, out of doors and in. A letter arrived for me
from Sir Percival Glyde's solicitor, acknowledging the receipt of my copy
of the anonymous letter and my accompanying statement of the case. Miss
Fairlie joined us in the afternoon, looking Tale and depressed, and altogether
unlike herself. I had some talk with her, and ventured on a delicate allusion
to Sir Percival. She listened and said nothing. All other subjects she
pursued willingly, but this subject she allowed to drop. I began to doubt
whether she might not be repenting of her engagement -- just as young ladies
often do, when repentance comes too late.

<P>On Monday Sir Percival Glyde arrived.

<P>I found him to be a most prepossessing man, so far as manners and appearance
were concerned. He looked rather older than I had expected, his head being
bald over the forehead, and his face somewhat marked and worn, but his
movements were as active and his spirits as high as a young man's. His
meeting with Miss Halcombe was delightfully hearty and unaffected, and
his reception of me, upon my being presented to him, was so easy and pleasant
that we got on together like old friends. Miss Fairlie was not with us
when he arrived, but she entered the room about ten minutes afterwards.
Sir Percival rose and paid his compliments with perfect grace. His evident
concern on seeing the change for the worse in the young lady's looks was
expressed with a mixture of tenderness and respect, with an unassuming
delicacy of tone, voice, and manner, which did equal credit to his good
breeding and his good sense. I was rather surprised, under these circumstances,
to see that Miss Fairlie continued to be constrained and uneasy in his
presence, and that she took the first opportunity of leaving the room again.
Sir Percival neither noticed the restraint in her reception of him, nor
her sudden withdrawal from our society. He had not obtruded his attentions
on her while she was present, and he did not embarrass Miss Halcombe by
any allusion to her departure when she was gone. His tact and taste were
never at fault on this or any other occasion while I was in his company
at Limmeridge House.

<P>As soon as Miss Fairlie had left the room he spared us all embarrassment
on the subject of the anonymous letter, by adverting to it of his own accord.
He had stopped in London on his way from Hampshire, had seen his solicitor,
had read the documents forwarded by me, and had travelled on to Cumberland,
anxious to satisfy our minds by the speediest and the fullest explanation
that words could convey. On hearing him express himself to this effect,
I offered him the original letter, which I had kept for his inspection.
He thanked me, and declined to look at it, saying that he had seen the
copy, and that he was quite willing to leave the original in our hands.

<P>The statement itself, on which he immediately entered, was as simple
and satisfactory as I had all along anticipated it would be.

<P>Mrs Catherick, he informed us, had in past years laid him under some
obligations for faithful services rendered to his family connections and
to himself. She had been doubly unfortunate in being married to a husband
who had deserted her, and in having an only child whose mental faculties
had been in a disturbed condition from a very early age. Although her marriage
had removed her to a part of Hampshire far distant from the neighbourhood
in which Sir Percival's property was situated, he had taken care not to
lose sight of her -- his friendly feeling towards the poor woman, in consideration
of her past services, having been greatly strengthened by his admiration
of the patience and courage with which she supported her calamities. In
course of time the symptoms of mental affliction in her unhappy daughter
increased to such a serious extent, as to make it a matter of necessity
to place her under proper medical care. Mrs Catherick herself recognised
this necessity, but she also felt the prejudice common to persons occupying
her respectable station, against allowing her child to be admitted, as
a pauper, into a public Asylum. Sir Percival had respected this prejudice,
as he respected honest independence of feeling in any rank of life, and
had resolved to mark his grateful sense of Mrs Catherick's early attachment
to the interests of himself and his family, by defraying the expense of
her daughter's maintenance in a trustworthy private Asylum. To her mother's
regret, and to his own regret, the unfortunate creature had discovered
the share which circumstances had induced him to take in placing her under
restraint, and had conceived the most intense hatred and distrust of him
in consequence. To that hatred and distrust -- which had expressed itself
in various ways in the Asylum -- the anonymous letter, written after her
escape, was plainly attributable. If Miss Halcombe's or Mr Gilmore's recollection
of the document did not confirm that view, or if they wished for any additional
particulars about the Asylum (the address of which he mentioned, as well
as the names and addresses of the two doctors on whose certificates the
patient was admitted), he was ready to answer any question and to clear
up any uncertainty. He had done his duty to the unhappy young woman, by
instructing his solicitor to spare no expense in tracing her, and in restoring
her once more to medical care, and he was now only anxious to do his duty
towards Miss Fairlie and towards her family, in the same plain. straightforward
way.

<P>I was the first to speak in answer to this appeal. My own course was
plain to me. It is the great beauty of the Law that it can dispute any
human statement, made under any circumstances, and reduced to any form.
If I had felt professionally called upon to set up a case against Sir Percival
Glyde, on the strength of his own explanation, I could have done so beyond
all doubt. But my duty did not lie in this direction -- my function was
of the purely judicial kind. I was to weigh the explanation we had just
heard, to allow all due force to the high reputation of the gentleman who
offered it, and to decide honestly whether the probabilities, on Sir Percival's
own showing, were plainly with him, or plainly against him. My own conviction
was that they were plainly with him, and I accordingly declared that his
explanation was, to my mind, unquestionably a satisfactory one.

<P>Miss Halcombe, after looking at me very earnestly, said a few words,
on her side, to the same effect -- with a certain hesitation of manner,
however, which the circumstances did not seem to me to warrant. I am unable
to say, positively, whether Sir Percival noticed this or not. My opinion
is that he did, seeing that he pointedly resumed the subject, although
he might now, with all propriety, have allowed it to drop.

<P>`If my plain statement of facts had only been addressed to Mr Gilmore,'
he said, `I should consider any further reference to this unhappy matter
as unnecessary. I may fairly expect Mr Gilmore, as a gentleman, to believe
me on my word, and when he has done me that justice, all discussion of
the subject between us has come to an end. But my position with a lady
is not the same. I owe to her -- what I would concede to no man alive --
a proof of the truth of my assertion. You cannot ask for that proof, Miss
Halcombe, and it is therefore my duty to you, and still more to Miss Fairlie,
to offer it. May I beg that you will write at once to the mother of this
unfortunate woman -- to Mrs Catherick -- to ask for her testimony in support
of the explanation which I have just offered to you.'

<P>I saw Miss Halcombe change colour, and look a little uneasy. Sir Percival's
suggestion, politely as it was expressed, appeared to her, as it appeared
to me, to point very delicately at the hesitation which her manner had
betrayed a moment or two since.

<P>`I hope, Sir Percival, you don't do me the injustice to suppose that
I distrust you,' she said quickly.

<P>`Certainly not, Miss Halcombe. I make my proposal purely as an act of
attention to you. Will you excuse my obstinacy if I still venture to press
it?'

<P>He walked to the writing-table as he spoke, drew a chair to it, and
opened the papercase.

<P>`Let me beg you to write the note,' he said, `as a favour to me. It
need not occupy you more than a few minutes. You have only to ask Mrs Catherick
two questions. First, if her daughter was placed in the Asylum with her
knowledge and approval. Secondly, if the share I took in the matter was
such as to merit the expression of her gratitude towards myself. Mr Gilmore's
mind is at ease on this unpleasant subject, and your mind is at ease --
pray set my mind at ease also by writing the note.'

<P>`You oblige me to grant your request, Sir Percival, when I would much
rather refuse it.'

<P>With those words Miss Halcombe rose from her place and went to the writing-table.
Sir Percival thanked her, handed her a pen, and then walked away towards
the fireplace. Miss Fairlie's little Italian greyhound was lying on the
rug. He held out his hand, and called to the dog good-humouredly.

<P>`Come, Nina,' he said, `we remember each other, don't we?'

<P>The little beast, cowardly and cross-grained, as pet-dogs usually are,
looked up at him sharply, shrank away from his outstretched hand, whined,
shivered, and hid itself under a sofa. It was scarcely possible that he
could have been put out by such a trifle as a dog's reception of him, but
I observed, nevertheless, that he walked away towards the window very suddenly.
Perhaps his temper is irritable at times if so, I can sympathise with him.
My temper is irritable at times too.

<P>Miss Halcombe was not long in writing the note. When it was done she
rose from the writing-table, and handed the open sheet of paper to Sir
Percival. He bowed, took it from her, folded it up immediately without
looking at the contents, sealed it, wrote the address, and handed it back
to her in silence. I never saw anything more gracefully and more becomingly
done in my life.

<P>`You insist on my posting this letter, Sir Percival?' said Miss Halcombe.

<P>`I beg you will post it,' he answered. `And now that it is written and
sealed up, allow me to ask one or two last questions about the unhappy
woman to whom it refers. I have read the communication which Mr Gilmore
kindly addressed to my solicitor, describing the circumstances under which
the writer of the anonymous letter was identified. But there are certain
points to which that statement does not refer. Did Anne Catherick see Miss
Fairlie?'

<P>`Certainly not,' replied Miss Halcombe.

<P>`Did she see you?'

<P>`No.'

<P>`She saw nobody from the house then, except a certain Mr Hartright,
who accidentally met with her in the churchyard here?'

<P>`Nobody else.'

<P>`Mr Hartright was employed at Limmeridge as a drawing-master, I believe?
Is he a member of one of the Water-Colour Societies?'

<P>`I believe he is,' answered Miss Halcombe.

<P>He paused for a moment, as if he was thinking over the last answer,
and then added --

<P>`Did you find out where Anne Catherick was living, when she was in this
neighbourhood?'

<P>`Yes. At a farm on the moor, called Todd's Corner.'

<P>`It is a duty we all owe to the poor creature herself to trace her,'
continued Sir Percival. `She may have said something at Todd's Corner which
may help us to find her. I will go there and make inquiries on the chance.
In the meantime, as I cannot prevail on myself to discuss this painful
subject with Miss Fairlie, may I beg, Miss Halcombe, that you will kindly
undertake to give her the necessary explanation, deferring it of course
until you have received the reply to that note.'

<P>Miss Halcombe promised to comply with his request. He thanked her, nodded
pleasantly, and left us, to go and establish himself in his own room. As
he opened the door the cross-grained greyhound poked out her sharp muzzle
from under the sofa, and barked and snapped at him.

<P>`A good morning's work, Miss Halcombe,' I said, as soon as we were alone.
`Here is an anxious day well ended already.'

<P>`Yes,' she answered; `no doubt. I am very glad your mind is satisfied.'

<P>`My mind! Surely, with that note in your hand, your mind is at ease
too?'

<P>`Oh yes -- how can it be otherwise? I know the thing could not be,'
she went on, speaking more to herself than to me; `but I almost wish Walter
Hartright had stayed here long enough to be present at the explanation,
and to hear the proposal to me to write this note.'

<P>I was a little surprised -- perhaps a little piqued also -- by these
last words.

<P>`Events, it is true, connected Mr Hartright very remarkably with the
affair of the letter,' I said; `and I readily admit that he conducted himself,
all things considered, with great delicacy and discretion. But I am quite
at a loss to understand what useful influence his presence could have exercised
in relation to the effect of Sir Percival's statement on your mind or mine.'

<P>`It was only a fancy,' she said absently. `There is no need to discuss
it, Mr Gilmore. Your experience ought to be, and is, the best guide I can
desire.'

<P>I did not altogether like her thrusting the whole responsibility, in
this marked manner, on my shoulders. If Mr Fairlie had done it, I should
not have been surprised. But resolute, clear-minded Miss Halcombe was the
very last person in the world whom I should have expected to find shrinking
from the expression of an opinion of her own.

<P>`If any doubts still trouble you,' I said, `why not mention them to
me at once? Tell me plainly, have you any reason to distrust Sir Percival
Glyde?'

<P>`None whatever.'

<P>`Do you see anything improbable, or contradictory, in his explanation?'

<P>`How can I say I do, after the proof he has offered me of the truth
of it? Can there be better testimony in his favour, Mr Gilmore, than the
testimony of the woman's mother?'

<P>`None better. If the answer to your note of inquiry proves to be satisfactory,
I for one cannot see what more any friend of Sir percival's can possibly
expect from him.'

<P>`Then we will post the note,' she said, arising to leave the room, `and
dismiss all further reference to the subject until the answer arrives.
Don't attach any weight to my hesitation. I can give no better reason for
it than that I have been over-anxious about Laura lately -- and anxiety,
Mr Gilmore, unsettles the strongest of us.'

<P>She left me abruptly, her naturally firm voice faltering as she spoke
those last words. A sensitive, vehement, passionate nature -- a woman of
ten thousand in these trivial, superficial times. I had known her from
her earliest years -- I had seen her tested, as she grew up, in more than
one trying family crisis, and my long experience made me attach an importance
to her hesitation under the circumstances here detailed, which I should
certainly not have felt in the case of another woman. I could see no cause
for any uneasiness or any doubt, but she had made me a little uneasy, and
a little doubtful, nevertheless. In my youth, I should have chafed and
fretted under the irritation of my own unreasonable state of mind. In my
age, I knew better, and went out philosophically to walk it off.
<CENTER>
<H2>
II</H2></CENTER>
We all met again at dinner-time.

<P>Sir Percival was in such boisterous high spirits that I hardly recognised
him as the same man whose quiet tact, refinement, and good sense had impressed
me so strongly at the interview of the morning. The only trace of his former
self that I could detect reappeared, every now and then, in his manner
towards Miss Fairlie. A look or a word from her suspended his loudest laugh,
checked his gayest flow of talk, and rendered him all attention to her,
and to no one else at table, in an instant. Although he never openly tried
to draw her into the conversation, he never lost the slightest chance she
gave him of letting her drift into it by accident, and of saying the words
to her, under those favourable circumstances, which a man with less tact
and delicacy would have pointedly addressed to her the moment they occurred
to him. Rather to my surprise, Miss Fairlie appeared to be sensible of
his attentions without being moved by them. She was a little confused from
time to time when he looked at her, or spoke to her; but she never warmed
towards him. Rank, fortune, good breeding, good looks, the respect of a
gentleman, and the devotion of a lover were all humbly placed at her feet,
and, so far as appearances went, were all offered in vain.

<P>On the next day, the Tuesday, Sir Percival went in the morning (taking
one of the servants with him as a guide) to Todd's Corner- His inquiries,
as I afterwards heard, led to no results. On his return he had an interview
with Mr Fairlie, and in the afternoon he and Miss Halcombe rode out together.
Nothing else happened worthy of record. The evening passed as usual. There
was no change in Sir Percival, and no change in Miss Fairlie.

<P>The Wednesday's post brought with it an event -- the reply from Mrs
Catherick. I took a copy of the document, which I have preserved, and which
I may as well present in this place. It ran as follows --

<P>`MADAM, -- I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, inquiring
whether my daughter, Anne, was placed under medical superintendence with
my knowledge and approval, and whether the share taken in the matter by
Sir Percival Glyde was such as to merit the expression of my gratitude
towards that gentleman. Be pleased to accept my answer in the affirmative
to both those questions, and believe me to remain, your obedient servant,&nbsp;<l>`JANE
ANNE CATHERICK.'

<P>Short, sharp, and to the point; in form rather a business-like letter
for a woman to write -- in substance as plain a confirmation as could be
desired of Sir Percival Glyde's statement. This was my opinion, and with
certain minor reservations, Miss Halcombe's opinion also. Sir Percival,
when the letter was shown to him, did not appear to be struck by the sharp,
short tone of it. He told us that Mrs Catherick was a woman of few words,
a clear-headed, straightforward, unimaginative person, who wrote briefly
and plainly, just as she spoke.

<P>The next duty to be accomplished, now that the answer had been received,
was to acquaint Miss Fairlie with Sir Percival's explanation. Miss Halcombe
had undertaken to do this, and had left the room to go to her sister, when
she suddenly returned again, and sat down by the easy-chair in which I
was reading the newspaper. Sir Percival had gone out a minute before to
look at the stables, and no one was in the room but ourselves.

<P>`I suppose we have really and truly done all we can?' she said, turning
and twisting Mrs Catherick's letter in her hand.

<P>`If we are friends of Sir Percival's, who know him and trust him, we
have done all, and more than all, that is necessary,' I answered, a little
annoyed by this return of her hesitation. `But if we are enemies who suspect
him --'

<P>`That alternative is not even to be thought of,' she interposed. `We
are Sir Percival's friends, and if generosity and forbearance can add to
our regard for him, we ought to be Sir Percival's admirers as well. You
know that he saw Mr Fairlie yesterday, and that he afterwards went out
with me.'

<P>`Yes. I saw you riding away together.'

<P>`We began the ride by talking about Anne Catherick, and about the singular
manner in which Mr Hartright met with her. But we soon dropped that subject,
and Sir Percival spoke next, in the most unselfish terms, of his engagement
with Laura. He said he had observed that she was out of spirits, and he
was willing, if not informed to the contrary, to attribute to that cause
the alteration in her manner towards him during his present visit. If,
however, there was any more serious reason for the change, he would entreat
that no constraint might be placed on her inclinations either by Mr Fairlie
or by me. All he asked, in that case, was that she would recall to mind,
for the last time, what the circumstances were under which the engagement
between them was made, and what his conduct had been from the beginning
of the courtship to the present time. If, after due reflection on those
two subjects, she seriously desired that he should withdraw his pretensions
to the honour of becoming her husband -- and if she would tell him so plainly
with her own lips -- he would sacrifice himself by leaving her perfectly
free to withdraw from the engagement.'

<P>`No man could say more than that, Miss Halcombe. As to my experience,
few men in his situation would have said as much.'

<P>She paused after I had spoken those words, and looked at me with a singular
expression of perplexity and distress.

<P>`I accuse nobody, and I suspect nothing,' she broke out abruptly. `But
I cannot and will not accept the responsibility of persuading Laura to
this marriage.'

<P>`That is exactly the course which Sir Percival Glyde has himself requested
you to take,' I replied in astonishment. `He has begged you not to force
her inclinations.'

<P>`And he indirectly obliges me to force them, if I give her his message.'

<P>`How can that possibly be?'

<P>`Consult your own knowledge of Laura, Mr Gilmore. If I tell her to reflect
on the circumstances of her engagement, I at once appeal to two of the
strongest feelings in her nature -- to her love for her father's memory,
and to her strict regard for truth. You know that she never broke a promise
in her life -- you know that she entered on this engagement at the beginning
of her father's fatal illness, and that he spoke hopefully and happily
of her marriage to Sir Percival Glyde on his deathbed.'

<P>I own that I was a little shocked at this view of the case.

<P>`Surely,' I said, `you don't mean to infer that when Sir Percival spoke
to you yesterday he speculated on such a result as you have just mentioned?'

<P>Her frank, fearless face answered for her before she spoke.

<P>`Do you think I would remain an instant in the company of any man whom
I suspected of such baseness as that?' she asked angrily.

<P>I liked to feel her hearty indignation flash out on me in that way.
We see so much malice and so little indignation in my profession.

<P>`In that case,' I said, `excuse me if I tell you, in our legal phrase,
that you are travelling out of the record. Whatever the consequences may
be, Sir Percival has a right to expect that your sister should carefully
consider her engagement from every reasonable point of view before she
claims her release from it. If that unlucky letter has prejudiced her against
him, go at once, and tell her that he has cleared himself in your eyes
and in mine. What objection can she urge against him after that? What excuse
can she possibly have for changing her mind about a man whom she had virtually
accepted for her husband more than two years ago?'

<P>`In the eyes of law and reason, Mr Gilmore, no excuse, I daresay. If
she still hesitates, and if I still hesitate, you must attribute our strange
conduct, if you like, to caprice in both cases, and we must bear the imputation
as well as we can.'

<P>With those words she suddenly rose and left me. When a sensible woman
has a serious question put to her, and evades it by a flippant answer,
it is a sure sign, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, that she has
something to conceal. I returned to the perusal of the newspaper, strongly
suspecting that Miss Halcombe and Miss Fairlie had a secret between them
which they were keeping from Sir Percival, and keeping from me. I thought
this hard on both of us, especially on Sir Percival.

<P>My doubts -- or to speak more correctly, my convictions -- were confirmed
by Miss Halcombe's language and manner when I saw her again later in the
day. She was suspiciously brief and reserved in telling me the result of
her interview with her sister. Miss Fairlie, it appeared, had listened
quietly while the affair of the letter was placed before her in the right
point of view, but when Miss Halcombe next proceeded to say that the object
of Sir Percival's visit at Limmeridge was to prevail on her to let a day
be fixed for the marriage, she checked all further reference to the subject
by begging for time. If Sir Percival would consent to spare her for the
present, she would undertake to give him his final answer before the end
of the year. She pleaded for this delay with such anxiety and agitation,
that Miss Halcombe had promised to use her influence, if necessary, to
obtain it, and there, at Miss Fairlie's earnest entreaty, all further discussion
of the marriage question had ended.

<P>The purely temporary arrangement thus proposed might have been convenient
enough to the young lady, but it proved somewhat embarrassing to the writer
of these lines. That morning's post had brought a letter from my partner,
which obliged me to return to town the next day by the afternoon train.
It was extremely probable that I should find no second opportunity of presenting
myself at Limmeridge House during the remainder of the year. In that case,
supposing Miss Fairlie ultimately decided on holding to her engagement,
my necessary personal communication with her, before I drew her settlement,
would become something like a downright impossibility, and we should be
obliged to commit to writing questions which ought always to be discussed
on both sides by word of mouth. I said nothing about this difficulty until
Sir Percival had been consulted on the subject of the desired delay. He
was too gallant a gentleman not to grant the request immediately. When
Miss Halcombe informed me of this I told her that I must absolutely speak
to her sister before I left Limmeridge, and it was, therefore, arranged
that I should see Miss Fairlie in her own sitting-room the next morning.
She did not come down to dinner, or join us in the evening. Indisposition
was the excuse, and I thought Sir Percival looked, as well he might, a
little annoyed when he heard of it.

<P>The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, I went up to Miss Fairlie's
sitting-room. The poor girl looked so pale and sad, and came forward to
welcome me so readily and prettily, that the resolution to lecture her
on her caprice and indecision, which I had been forming all the way upstairs,
failed me on the spot. I led her back to the chair from which she had risen,
and placed myself opposite to her. Her cross-grained pet greyhound was
in the room, and I fully expected a barking and snapping reception. Strange
to say, the whimsical little brute falsified my expectations by jumping
into my lap and poking its sharp muzzle familiarly into my hand the moment
I sat down.

<P>`You used often to sit on my knee when you were a child, my dear,' I
said, `and now your little dog seems determined to succeed you in the vacant
throne. Is that pretty drawing your doing?'

<P>I pointed to a little album which lay on the table by her side, and
which she had evidently been looking over when I came in. The page that
lay open had a small water-colour landscape very neatly mounted on it.
This was the drawing which had suggested my question -- an idle question
enough -- but how could I begin to talk of business to her the moment I
opened my lips?

<P>`No,' she said, looking away from the drawing rather confusedly, `it
is not my doing.'

<P>Her fingers had a restless habit, which I remembered in her as a child,
of always playing with the first thing that came to hand whenever any one
was talking to her- On this occasion they wandered to the album, and toyed
absently about the margin of the little water-colour drawing. The expression
of melancholy deepened on her face. She did not look at the drawing, or
look at me. Her eyes moved uneasily from object to object in the room,
betraying plainly that she suspected what my purpose was in coming to speak
to her. Seeing that, I thought it best to get to the purpose with as little
delay as possible.

<P>`One of the errands, my dear, which brings me here is to bid you good-bye,'
I began. `I must get back to London today : and, before I leave, I want
to have a word with you on the subject of your own affairs.'

<P>`I am very sorry you are going, Mr Gilmore,' she said, looking at me
kindly. `It is like the happy old times to have you here.'

<P>`I hope I may be able to come back and recall those pleasant memories
once more,' I continued; `but as there is some uncertainty about the future,
I must take my opportunity when I can get it, and speak to you now. I am
your old lawyer and your old friend, and I may remind you, I am sure, without
offence, of the possibility of your marrying Sir Percival Glyde.'

<P>She took her hand off the little album as suddenly as if it had turned
hot and burnt her. Her fingers twined together nervously in her lap, her
eyes looked down again at the floor, and an expression of constraint settled
on her face which looked almost like an expression of pain.

<P>`Is it absolutely necessary to speak of my marriage engagement?' she
asked in low tones.

<P>`It is necessary to refer to it,' I answered, `but not to dwell on it.
Let us merely say that you may marry, or that you may not marry. In the
first case, I must be prepared, beforehand, to draw your settlement, and
I ought not to do that without, as a matter of politeness, first consulting
you. This may be my only chance of hearing what your wishes are. Let us,
therefore, suppose the case of your marrying, and let me inform you, in
as few words as possible, what your position is now, and what you may make
it, if you please, in the future.'

<P>I explained to her the object of a marriage-settlement, and then told
her exactly what her prospects were -- in the first place, on her coming
of age, and in the second place, on the decease of her uncle -- marking
the distinction between the property in which she had a life-interest only,
and the property which was left at her own control. She listened attentively,
with the constrained expression still on her face, and her hands still
nervously clasped together in her lap.

<P>`And now,' I said in conclusion, `tell me if you can think of any condition
which, in the case we have supposed, you would wish me to make for you
-- subject, of course, to your guardian's approval, as you are not yet
of age.'

<P>She moved uneasily in her chair, then looked in my face on a sudden
very earnestly.

<P>`If it does happen,' she began faintly, `if I am --'

<P>`If you are married,' I added, helping her out.

<P>`Don't let him part me from Marian,' she cried, with a sudden outbreak
of energy. `Oh, Mr Gilmore, pray make it law that Marian is to live with
me!'

<P>Under other circumstances I might, perhaps, have been amused at this
essentially feminine interpretation of my question, and of the long explanation
which had preceded it. But her looks and tones, when she spoke, were of
a kind to make me more than serious -- they distressed me. Her words, few
as they were, betrayed a desperate clinging to the past which boded ill
for the future.

<P>`Your having Marian Halcombe to live with you can easily be settled
by private arrangement,' I said. `You hardly understood my question, I
think. It referred to your own property -- to the disposal of your money.
Supposing you were to make a will when you come of age, who would you like
the money to go to?'

<P>`Marian has been mother and sister both to me,' said the good, affectionate
girl, her pretty blue eyes glistening while she spoke. `May I leave it
to Marian, Mr Gilmore?'

<P>`Certainly, my love,' I answered. `But remember what a large sum it
is- Would you like it all to go to Miss Halcombe?'

<P>She hesitated; her colour came and went, and her hand stole back again
to the little album.

<P>`Not all of it,' she said. `There is some one else besides Marian --'

<P>She stopped; her colour heightened, and the fingers of the hand that
rested upon the album beat gently on the margin of the drawing, as if her
memory had set them going mechanically with the remembrance of a favourite
tune.

<P>`You mean some other member of the family besides Miss Halcombe?' I
suggested, seeing her at a loss to proceed,

<P>The heightening colour spread to her forehead and her neck, and the
nervous fingers suddenly clasped themselves fast round the edge of the
book.

<P>`There is some one else,' she said, not noticing my last words, though
she had evidently heard them; `there is some one else who might like a
little keepsake if -- if I might leave it. There would be no harm if I
should die first --'

<P>She paused again. The colour that had spread over her cheeks suddenly,
as suddenly left them. The hand on the album resigned its hold, trembled
a little, and moved the book away from her. She looked at me for an instant
-- then turned her head aside in the chair. Her handkerchief fell to the
floor as she changed her position, and she hurriedly hid her face from
me in her hands.

<P>Sad! To remember her, as I did, the liveliest, happiest child that ever
laughed the day through, and to see her now, in the flower of her age and
her beauty, so broken and so brought down as this!

<P>In the distress that she caused me I forgot the years that had passed,
and the change they had made in our position towards one another. I moved
my chair close to her, and picked up her handkerchief from the carpet,
and drew her hands from her face gently. `Don't cry, my love,' I said,
and dried the tears that were gathering in her eyes with my own hand, as
if she had been the little Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.

<P>It was the best way I could have taken to compose her. She laid her
head on my shoulder, and smiled faintly through her tears.

<P>`I am very sorry for forgetting myself,' she said artlessly. `I have
not been well -- I have felt sadly weak and nervous lately, and I often
cry without reason when I am alone. I am better now -- I can answer you
as I ought, Mr Gilmore, I can indeed.'

<P>`No, no, my dear,' I replied, `we will consider the subject as done
with for the present. You have said enough to sanction my taking the best
possible care of your interests, and we can settle details at another opportunity.
Let us have done with business now, and talk of something else.'

<P>I led her at once into speaking on other topics. In ten minutes' time
she was in better spirits, and I rose to take my leave.

<P>`Come here again,' she said earnestly. `I will try to be worthier of
your kind feeling for me and for my interests if you will only come again.'

<P>Still clinging to the past -- that past which I represented to her,
in my way, as Miss Halcombe did in hers! It troubled me sorely to see her
looking back, at the beginning of her career, just as I look back at the
end of mine.

<P>`If I do come again, I hope I shall find you better,' I said; `better
and happier. God bless you, my dear!'

<P>She only answered by putting up her cheek to me to be kissed. Even lawyers
have hearts, and mine ached a little as I took leave of her.

<P>The whole interview between us had hardly lasted more than half an hour
-- she had not breathed a word, in my presence, to explain the mystery
of her evident distress and dismay at the prospect of her marriage, and
yet she had contrived to win me over to her side of the question, I neither
knew how nor why. I had entered the room, feeling that Sir Percival Glyde
had fair reason to complain of the manner in which she was treating him.
I left it, secretly hoping that matters might end in her taking him at
his word and claiming her release. A man of my age and experience ought
to have known better than to vacillate in this unreasonable manner. I can
make no excuse for myself; I can only tell the truth, and say -- so it
was.

<P>The hour for my departure was now drawing near. I sent to Mr Fairlie
to say that I would wait on him to take leave if he liked, but that he
must excuse my being rather in a hurry. He sent a message back, written
in pencil on a slip of paper: `Kind love and best wishes, dear Gilmore.
Hurry of any kind is inexpressibly injurious to me. Pray take care of yourself.
Goodbye.'

<P>rust before I left I saw Miss Halcombe for a moment alone.

<P>`Have you said all you wanted to Laura?' she asked.

<P>`Yes,' I replied. `She is very weak and nervous -- I am glad she has
you to take care of her.'

<P>Miss Halcombe's sharp eyes studied my face attentively.

<P>`You are altering your opinion about Laura,' she said. `You are readier
to make allowances for her than you were yesterday.'

<P>No sensible man ever engages, unprepared, in a fencing match of words
with a woman. I only answered --

<P>`Let me know what happens. I will do nothing till I hear from you.'

<P>She still looked hard in my face. `I wish it was all over, and well
over, Mr Gilmore -- and so do you.' With those words she left me.

<P>Sir Percival most politely insisted on seeing me to the carriage door.

<P>`If you are ever in my neighbourhood,' he said, `pray don't forget that
I am sincerely anxious to improve our acquaintance. The tried and trusted
old friend of this family will be always a welcome visitor in any house
of mine.'

<P>A really irresistible man -- courteous, considerate, delightfully free
from pride -- a gentleman, every inch of him. As I drove away to the station
I felt as if I could cheerfully do anything to promote the interests of
Sir Percival Glyde -- anything in the world, except drawing the marriage
settlement of his wife.
