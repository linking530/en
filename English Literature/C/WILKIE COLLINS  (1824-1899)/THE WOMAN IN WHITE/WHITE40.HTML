THE COUNT'S NARRATIVE</H2></CENTER>
IN the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty I arrived in England, charged
with a delicate political mission from abroad. Confidential persons were
semi-officially connected with me, whose exertions I was authorised to
direct, Monsieur and Madame Rubelle being among the number. Some weeks
of spare time were at my disposal, before I entered on my functions by
establishing myself in the suburbs of London. Curiosity may stop here to
ask for some explanation of those functions on my part. I entirely sympathise
with the request. I also regret that diplomatic reserve forbids me to comply
with it.

<P>I arranged to pass the preliminary period of repose, to which I have
just referred, in the superb mansion of my late lamented friend, Sir Percival
Glyde. He arrived from the Continent with his wife. I arrived from the
Continent with <I>me</I>. England is the land of domestic happiness --
how appropriately we entered it under these domestic circumstances!

<P>The bond of friendship which united Percival and myself was strengthened,
on this occasion, by a touching similarity in the pecuniary position on
his side and on mine. We both wanted money. Immense necessity! Universal
want! Is there a civilised human being who does not feel for us? How insensible
must that man be! Or how rich!

<P>I enter into no sordid particulars, in discussing this part of the subject.
My mind recoils from them. With a Roman austerity, I show my empty purse
and Percival's to the shrinking public gaze. Let us allow the deplorable
fact to assert itself, once for all, in that manner, and pass on.

<P>We were received at the mansion by the magnificent creature who is inscribed
on my heart as `Marian,' who is known in the colder atmosphere of society
as `Miss Halcombe.'

<P>rust Heaven I with what inconceivable rapidity I learnt to adore that
woman. At sixty, I worshipped her with the volcanic ardour of eighteen.
All the gold of my rich nature was poured hopelessly at her feet. My wife
-- poor angel! -- my wife, who adores me, got nothing but the shillings
and the pennies. Such is the World, such Man, such Love. What are we (I
ask) but puppets in a show-box? Oh, omnipotent Destiny, pull our strings
gently I Dance us mercifully off our miserable little stage!

<P>The preceding lines, rightly understood, express an entire system of
philosophy. It is mine.

<P>I resume.

<P>The domestic position at the commencement of our residence at Blackwater
Park has been drawn with amazing accuracy, with profound mental insight,
by the hand of Marian herself. (Pass me the intoxicating familiarity of
mentioning this sublime creature by her Christian name.) Accurate knowledge
of the contents of her journal -- to which I obtained access by clandestine
means, unspeakably precious to me in the remembrance -- warns my eager
pen from topics which this essentially exhaustive woman has already made
her own.

<P>The interests -- interests, breathless and immense I -- with which I
am here concerned begin with the deplorable calamity of Marian's illness.

<P>The situation at this period was emphatically a serious one. Large sums
of money, due at a certain time, were wanted by Percival (I say nothing
of the modicum equally necessary to myself), and the one source to look
to for supplying them was the fortune of his wife, of which not one farthing
was at his disposal until her death. Bad so far, and worse still farther
on. My lamented friend had private troubles of his own, into which the
delicacy of my disinterested attachment to him forbade me from inquiring
too curiously. I knew nothing but that a woman, named Anne Catherick, was
hidden in the neighbourhood, that she was in communication with Lady Glyde,
and that the disclosure of a secret, which would be the certain ruin of
Percival, might be the result. He had told me himself that he was a lost
man, unless his wife was silenced, and unless Anne Catherick was found.
If he was a lost man, what would become of our pecuniary interests? Courageous
as I am by nature, I absolutely trembled at the idea!

<P>The whole force of my intelligence was now directed to the finding of
Anne Catherick. Our money affairs, important as they were, admitted of
delay -- but the necessity of discovering the woman admitted of none. I
only knew her by description, as presenting an extraordinary personal resemblance
to Lady Glyde. The statement of this curious fact -- intended merely to
assist me in identifying the person of whom we were in search -- when coupled
with the additional information that Anne Catherick had escaped from a
mad-house, started the first immense conception in my mind, which subsequently
led to such amazing results. That conception involved nothing less than
the complete transformation of two separate identities. Lady Glyde and
Anne Catherick were to change names, places, and destinies, the one with
the other -- the prodigious consequences contemplated by the change being
the gain of thirty thousand pounds, and the eternal preservation of Sir
Percival's secret.

<P>My instincts (which seldom err) suggested to me, on reviewing the circumstances,
that our invisible Anne would, sooner or later, return to the boat-house
at the Blackwater lake. There I posted myself, previously mentioning to
Mrs Michelson, the housekeeper, that I might be found when wanted, immersed
in study, in that solitary place. It is my rule never to make unnecessary
mysteries, and never to set people suspecting me for want of a little seasonable
candour on my part. Mrs Michelson believed in me from first to last. This
ladylike person (widow of a Protestant priest) overflowed with faith. Touched
by such superfluity of simple confidence in a woman of her mature years,
I opened the ample reservoirs of my nature and absorbed it all.

<P>I was rewarded for posting myself sentinel at the lake by the appearance
-- not of Anne Catherick herself, but of the person in charge of her. This
individual also overflowed with simple faith, which I absorbed in myself,
as in the case already mentioned. I leave her to describe the circumstances
(if she has not done so already) under which she introduced me to the object
of her maternal care. When I first saw Anne Catherick she was asleep. I
was electrified by the likeness between this unhappy woman and Lady Glyde.
The details of the grand scheme which had suggested themselves in outline
only, up to that period, occurred to me, in all their masterly combination,
at the sight of the sleeping face. At the same time, my heart, always accessible
to tender influences, dissolved in tears at the spectacle of suffering
before me. I instantly set myself to impart relief. In other words, I provided
the necessary stimulant for strengthening Anne Catherick to perform the
journey to London.

<P>At this point I enter a necessary protest, and correct a lamentable
error.

<P>The best years of my life have been passed in the ardent study of medical
and chemical science. Chemistry especially has always had irresistible
attractions for me from the enormous, the illimitable power which the knowledge
of it confers. Chemists -- I assert it emphatically -- might sway, if they
pleased, the destinies of humanity. Let me explain this before I go further.

<P>Mind, they say, rules the world. But what rules the mind? The body (follow
me closely here) lies at the mercy of the most omnipotent of all potentates
-- the Chemist. Give me -- Fosco -- chemistry; and when Shakespeare has
conceived Hamlet, and sits down to execute the conception -- with a few
grains of powder dropped into his daily food, I will reduce his mind, by
the action of his body, till his pen pours out the most abject drivel that
has ever degraded paper. Under similar circumstances, revive me the illustrious
Newton. I guarantee that when he sees the apple fall he shall eat it, instead
of discovering the principle of gravitation. Nero's dinner shall transform
Nero into the mildest of men before he has done digesting it, and the morning
draught of Alexander the Great shall make Alexander run for his life at
the first sight of the enemy the same afternoon. On my sacred word of honour
it is lucky for Society that modern chemists are, by incomprehensible good
fortune, the most harmless of mankind. The mass are worthy fathers of families,
who keep shops. The few are philosophers besotted with admiration for the
sound of their own lecturing voices, visionaries who waste their lives
on fantastic impossibilities, or quacks whose ambition soars no higher
than our corns. Thus Society escapes, and the illimitable power of Chemistry
remains the slave of the most superficial and the most insignificant ends.

<P>Why this outburst? Why this withering eloquence?

<P>Because my conduct has been misrepresented, because my motives have
been misunderstood. It has been assumed that I used my vast chemical resources
against Anne Catherick, and that I would have used them if I could against
the magnificent Marian herself. Odious insinuations both! All my interests
were concerned (as will be seen presently) in the preservation of Anne
Catherick's life. All my anxieties were concentrated on Marian's rescue
from the hands of the licensed imbecile who attended her, and who found
my advice confirmed from first to last by the physician from London. On
two occasions only -- both equally harmless to the individual on whom I
practised -- did I summon to myself the assistance of chemical knowledge.
On the fist of the two, after following Marian to the inn at Blackwater
(studying, behind a convenient waggon which hid me from her, the poetry
of motion, as embodied in her walk), I availed myself of the services of
my invaluable wife, to copy one and to intercept the other of two letters
which my adored enemy had entrusted to a discarded maid. In this case,
the letters being in the bosom of the girl's dress, Madame Fosco could
only open them, read them, perform her instructions, seal them, and put
them back again by scientific assistance -- which assistance I rendered
in a half-ounce bottle. The second occasion, when the same means were employed,
was the occasion (to which I shall soon refer) of Lady Glyde's arrival
in London. Never at any other time was I indebted to my Art as distinguished
from myself. To all other emergencies and complications my natural capacity
for grappling, single-handed, with circumstances, was invariably equal.
I affirm the all-pervading intelligence of that capacity. At the expense
of the Chemist I vindicate the Man.

<P>Respect this outburst of generous indignation. It has inexpressibly
relieved me En route! Let us proceed.

<P>Having suggested to Mrs Clement (or Clements, I am not sure which) that
the best method of keeping Anne out of Percival's reach was to remove her
to London -- having found that my Proposal was eagerly received, and having
appointed a day to meet the travellers at the station and to see them leave
it, I was at liberty to return to the house and to confront the difficulties
which still remained to be met.

<P>My first proceeding was to avail myself of the sublime devotion of my
wife. I had arranged with Mrs Clements that she should communicate her
London address, in Anne's interests, to Lady Glyde. But this was not enough.
Designing persons in my absence might shake the simple confidence of Mrs
Clements, and she might not write after all. Who could I find capable of
travelling to London by the train she travelled by, and of privately seeing
her home? I asked myself this question. The conjugal part of me immediately
answered -- Madame Fosco.

<P>After deciding on my wife's mission to London, I arranged that the journey
should serve a double purpose. A nurse for the suffering Marian, equally
devoted to the patient and to myself, was a necessity of my position. One
of the most eminently confidential and capable women in existence was by
good fortune at my disposal, I refer to that respectable matron, Madame
Rubelle, to whom I addressed a letter, at her residence in London, by the
hands of my wife.

<P>On the appointed day Mrs Clements and Anne Catherick met me at the station.
I politely saw them off. I politely saw Madame Fosco off by the same train.
The last thing at night my wife returned to Blackwater, having followed
her instructions with the most unimpeachable accuracy. She was accompanied
by Madame Rubelle, and she brought me the London address of Mrs Clements.
After-events proved this last precaution to have been unnecessary. Mrs
Clements punctually informed Lady Glyde of her place of abode. With a wary
eye on future emergencies, I kept the letter.

<P>The same day I had a brief interview with the doctor, at which I protested,
in the sacred interests of humanity, against his treatment of Marian's
case. He was insolent, as all ignorant people are. I showed no resentment,
I deferred quarrelling with him till it was necessary to quarrel to some
purpose.

<P>My next proceeding was to leave Blackwater myself. I had my London residence
to take in anticipation of coming events. I had also a little business
of the domestic sort to transact with Mr Frederick Fairlie. I found the
house I wanted in St John's Wood. I found Mr Fairlie at Limmeridge, Cumberland.

<P>My own private familiarity with the nature of Marian's correspondence
had previously informed me that she had written to Mr Fairlie, proposing,
as a relief to Lady Glyde's matrimonial embarrassments, to take her on
a visit to her uncle in Cumberland. This letter I had wisely allowed to
reach its destination, feeling at the time that it could do no harm, and
might do good. I now presented myself before Mr Fairlie to support Marian's
own proposal -- with certain modifications which, happily for the success
of my plans, were rendered really inevitable by her illness. It was necessary
that Lady Glyde should leave Blackwater alone, by her uncle's invitation,
and that she should rest a night on the journey at her aunt's house (the
house I had in St John's Wood) by her uncle's express advice. To achieve
these results, and to secure a note of invitation which could be shown
to Lady Glyde, were the objects of my visit to Mr Fairlie. When I have
mentioned that this gentleman was equally feeble in mind and body, and
that I let loose the whole force of my character on him, I have said enough.
I came, saw, and conquered Fairlie.

<P>On my return to Blackwater Park (with the letter of invitation) I found
that the doctor's imbecile treatment of Marian's case had led to the most
alarming results. The fever had turned to typhus. Lady Glyde, on the day
of my return, tried to force herself into the room to nurse her sister.
She and I had no affinities of sympathy -- she had committed the unpardonable
outrage on my sensibilities of calling me a spy -- she was a stumbling-block
in my way and in Percival's -- but, for all that, my magnanimity forbade
me to put her in danger of infection with my own hand. At the same time
I offered no hindrance to her putting herself in danger. If she had succeeded
in doing so, the intricate knot which I was slowly and patiently operating
on might perhaps have been cut by circumstances. As it was, the doctor
interfered and she was kept out of the room.

<P>I had myself previously recommended sending for advice to London. This
course had been now taken. The physician, on his arrival, confirmed my
view of the case. The crisis was serious. But we had hope of our charming
patient on the fifth day from the appearance of the typhus. I was only
once absent from Blackwater at this time -- when I went to London by the
morning train to make the final arrangements at my house in St John's Wood,
to assure myself by private inquiry that Mrs Clements had not moved, and
to settle one or two little preliminary matters with the husband of Madame
Rubelle. I returned at night. Five days afterwards the physician pronounced
our interesting Marian to be out of danger, and to be in need of nothing
but careful nursing. This was the time I had waited for. Now that medical
attendance was no longer indispensable, I played the first move in the
game by asserting myself against the doctor. He was one among many witnesses
in my way whom it was necessary to remove. A lively altercation between
us (in which Percival, previously instructed by me, refused to interfere)
served the purpose in view. I descended on the miserable man in an irresistible
avalanche of indignation, and swept him from the house.

<P>The servants were the next encumbrances to get rid of. Again I instructed
Percival (whose moral courage required perpetual stimulants), and Mrs Michelson
was amazed, one day, by hearing from her master that the establishment
was to be broken up, We cleared the house of all the servants but one,
who was kept for domestic purposes, and whose lumpish stupidity we could
trust to make no embarrassing discoveries. When they were gone, nothing
remained but to relieve ourselves of Mrs Michelson -- a result which was
easily achieved by sending this amiable lady to find lodgings for her mistress
at the sea-side.

<P>The circumstances were now exactly what they were required to be. Lady
Glyde was confined to her room by nervous illness, and the lumpish housemaid
(I forget her name) was shut up there at night in attendance on her mistress.
Marian, though fast recovering, still kept her bed, with Mrs Rubelle for
nurse. No other living creatures but my wife, myself, and Percival were
in the house. With all the chances thus in our favour I confronted the
next emergency, and played the second move in the game.

<P>The object of the second move was to induce Lady Glyde to leave Blackwater
unaccompanied by her sister. Unless we could persuade her that Marian had
gone on to Cumberland first, there was no chance of removing her, of her
own free will, from the house. To produce this necessary operation in her
mind, we concealed our interesting invalid in one of the uninhabited bedrooms
at Blackwater. At the dead of night Madame Fosco, Madame Rubelle, and myself
(Percival not being cool enough to be trusted) accomplished the concealment.
The scene was picturesque, mysterious, dramatic in the highest degree.
By my directions the bed had been made, in the morning, on a strong movable
framework of wood. We had only to lift the framework gently at the head
and foot, and to transport our patient where we pleased, without disturbing
herself or her bed. No chemical assistance was needed or used in this case.
Our interesting Marian lay in the deep repose of convalescence. We placed
the candles and opened the doors beforehand. I, in right of my great personal
strength, took the head of the framework -- my wife and Madame Rubelle
took the foot. I bore my share of that inestimably precious burden with
a manly tenderness, with a fatherly care. Where is the modern Rembrandt
who could depict our midnight procession? Alas for the Arts! alas for this
most pictorial of subjects! The modern Rembrandt is nowhere to be found.

<P>The next morning my wife and I started for London, leaving Marian secluded,
in the uninhabited middle of the house, under care of Madame Rubelle, who
kindly consented to imprison herself with her patient for two or three
days. Before taking our departure I gave Percival Mr Fairlie's letter of
invitation to his niece (instructing her to sleep on the journey to Cumberland
at her aunt's house), with directions to show it to Lady Glyde on hearing
from me. I also obtained from him the address of the Asylum in which Anne
Catherick had been confined, and a letter to the proprietor, announcing
to that gentleman the return of his runaway patient to medical care.

<P>I had arranged, at my last visit to the metropolis, to have our modest
domestic establishment ready to receive us when we arrived in London by
the early train. In consequence of this wise precaution, we were enabled
that same day to play the third move in the game -- the getting possession
of Anne Catherick.

<P>Dates are of importance here. I combine in myself the opposite characteristics
of a Man of Sentiment and a Man of Business. I have all the dates at my
fingers' ends.

<P>On Wednesday, the 24th of July 1850, I sent my wife in a cab to clear
Mrs Clements out of the way, in the first place. A supposed message from
Lady Glyde in London was sufficient to obtain this result. Mrs Clements
was taken away in the cab, and was left in the cab, while my wife (on pretence
of purchasing something at a shop) gave her the slip, and returned to receive
her expected visitor at our house in St John's Wood. It is hardly necessary
to add that the visitor had been described to the servants as `Lady Glyde.'

<P>In the meanwhile I had followed in another cab, with a note for Anne
Catherick, merely mentioning that Lady Glyde intended to keep Mrs Clements
to spend the day with her, and that she was to join them under care of
the good gentleman waiting outside, who had already saved her from discovery
in Hampshire by Sir Percival. The `good gentleman' sent in this note by
a street boy, and paused for results a door or two farther on. At the moment
when Anne appeared at the house door and closed it, this excellent man
had the cab door open ready for her, absorbed her into the vehicle, and
drove off.

<P>(Pass me, here, one exclamation in parenthesis. How interesting this
is!)

<P>On the way to Forest Road my companion showed no fear. I can be paternal
-- no man more so -- when I please, and I was intensely paternal on this
occasion. What titles I had to her confidence! I had compounded the medicine
which had done her good -- I had warned her of her danger from Sir Percival.
Perhaps l trusted too implicitly to these titles -- perhaps I underrated
the keenness of the lower instincts in persons of weak intellect -- it
is certain that I neglected to prepare her sufficiently for a disappointment
on entering my house. When I took her into the drawing-room -- when she
saw no one present but Madame Fosco, who was a stranger to her -- she exhibited
the most violent agitation; if she had scented danger in the air, as a
dog scents the presence of some creature unseen, her alarm could not have
displayed itself more suddenly and more causelessly. I interposed in vain.
The fear from which she was suffering I might have soothed, but the serious
heart-disease, under which she laboured, was beyond the reach of all moral
palliatives. To my unspeakable horror she was seized with convulsions --
a shock to the system, in her condition, which might have laid her dead
at any moment at our feet.

<P>The nearest doctor was sent for, and was told that `Lady Glyde' required
his immediate services. To my infinite relief, he was a capable man. I
represented my visitor to him as a person of weak intellect, and subject
to delusions, and I arranged that no nurse but my wife should watch in
the sick-room. The unhappy woman was too ill, however, to cause any anxiety
about what she might say. The one dread which now oppressed me was the
dread that the false Lady Glyde might die before the true Lady Glyde arrived
in London.

<P>I had written a note in the morning to Madame Rubelle, telling her to
join me at her husband's house on the evening of Friday the 26th, with
another note to Percival, warning him to show his wife her uncle's letter
of invitation, to assert that Marian had gone on before her, and to despatch
her to town by the midday train, on the 26th, also. On reflection I had
felt the necessity, in Anne Catherick's state of health, of precipitating
events, and of having Lady Glyde at my disposal earlier than I had originally
contemplated. What fresh directions, in the terrible uncertainty of my
position, could I now issue? I could do nothing but trust to chance and
the doctor. My emotions expressed themselves in pathetic apostrophes, which
I was just self-possessed enough to couple, in the hearing of other people,
with the name of `Lady Glyde.' In all other respects Fosco, on that memorable
day, was Fosco shrouded in total eclipse.

<P>She passed a bad night, she awoke worn out, but later in the day she
revived amazingly. My elastic spirits revived with her. I could receive
no answers from Percival and Madame Rubelle till the morning of the next
day, the 26th. In anticipation of their following my directions, which,
accident apart, I knew they would do, I went to secure a fly to fetch Lady
Glyde from the railway, directing it to be at my house on the 26th, at
two o'clock. After seeing the order entered in the book, I went on to arrange
matters with Monsieur Rubelle. I also procured the services of two gentlemen
who could furnish me with the necessary certificates of lunacy. One of
them I knew personally -- the other was known to Monsieur Rubelle. Both
were men whose vigorous minds soared superior to narrow scruples -- both
were labouring under temporary embarrassments -- both believed in ME.

<P>It was past five o'clock in the afternoon before I returned from the
performance of these duties. When I got back Anne Catherick was dead. Dead
on the 25th, and Lady Glyde was not to arrive in London till the 26th!

<P>I was stunned. Meditate on that. Fosco stunned!

<P>It was too late to retrace our steps. Before my return the doctor had
officiously undertaken to save me all trouble by registering the death,
on the date when it happened, with his own hand. My grand scheme, unassailable
hitherto, had its weak place now -- no efforts on my part could alter the
fatal event of the 25th. I turned manfully to the future. Percival's interests
and mine being still at stake, nothing was left but to play the game through
to the end. I recalled my impenetrable calm -- and played it.

<P>On the morning of the 26th Percival's letter reached me, announcing
his wife's arrival by the midday train. Madame Rubelle also wrote to say
she would follow in the evening. I started in the fly, leaving the false
Lady Glyde dead in the house, to receive the true Lady Glyde on her arrival
by the railway at three o'clock. Hidden under the seat of the carriage,
I carried with me all the clothes Anne Catherick had worn on coming into
my house -- they were destined to assist the resurrection of the woman
who was dead in the person of the woman who was living. What a situation!
I suggest it to the rising romance writers of England. I offer it, as totally
new, to the worn-out dramatists of France.

<P>Lady Glyde was at the station. There was great crowding and confusion,
and more delay than I liked (in case any of her friends had happened to
be on the spot), in reclaiming her luggage. Her fist questions, as we drove
off, implored me to tell her news of her sister. I invented news of the
most pacifying kind, assuring her that she was about to see her sister
at my house. My house, on this occasion only, was in the neighbourhood
of Leicester Square, and was in the occupation of Monsieur Rubelle, who
received us in the hall.

<P>I took my visitor upstairs into a back room, the two medical gentlemen
being there in waiting on the floor beneath to see the patient, and to
give me their certificates. After quieting Lady Glyde by the necessary
assurances about her sister, I introduced my friends separately to her
presence. They performed the formalities of the occasion briefly, intelligently,
conscientiously. I entered the room again as soon as they had left it,
and at once precipitated events by a reference of the alarming kind to
`Miss Halcombe's' state of health.

<P>Results followed as I had anticipated. Lady Glyde became frightened,
and turned faint. For a second time, and the last, I called Science to
my assistance. A medicated glass of water and a medicated bottle of smelling-salts
relieved her of all further embarrassment and alarm. Additional applications
later in the evening procured her the inestimable blessing of a good night's
rest. Madame Rubelle arrived in time to preside at Lady Glyde's toilet.
Her own clothes were taken away from her at night, and Anne Catherick's
were put on her in the morning, with the strictest regard to propriety,
by the matronly hands of the good Rubelle. Throughout the day I kept our
patient in a state of partially-suspended consciousness, until the dexterous
assistance of my medical friends enabled me to procure the necessary order
rather earlier than I had ventured to hope. That evening (the evening of
the 27th) Madame Rubelle and I took our revived `Anne Catherick' to the
Asylum. She was received with great surprise, but without suspicion, thanks
to the order and certificates, to Percival's letter, to the likeness, to
the clothes, and to the patient's own confused mental condition at the
time. I returned at once to assist Madame Fosco in the preparations for
the burial of the false `Lady Glyde,' having the clothes and luggage of
the true `Lady Glyde' in my possession. They were afterwards sent to Cumberland
by the conveyance which was used for the funeral. I attended the funeral,
with becoming dignity, attired in the deepest mourning.

<P>My narrative of these remarkable events, written under equally remarkable
circumstances, closes here. The minor precautions which I observed in communicating
with Limmeridge House are already known, so is the magnificent success
of my enterprise, so are the solid pecuniary results which followed it.
I have to assert, with the whole force of my conviction, that the one weak
place in my scheme would never have been found out if the one weak place
in my heart had not been discovered first. Nothing but my fatal admiration
for Marian restrained me from stepping in to my own rescue when she effected
her sister's escape. I ran the risk, and trusted in the complete destruction
of Lady Glyde's identity. If either Marian or Mr Hartright attempted to
assert that identity, they would publicly expose themselves to the imputation
of sustaining a rank deception, they would be distrusted and discredited
accordingly, and they would therefore be powerless to place my interests
or Percival's secret in jeopardy. I committed one error in trusting myself
to such a blindfold calculation of chances as this. I committed another
when Percival had paid the penalty of his own obstinacy and violence, by
granting Lady Glyde a second reprieve from the mad-house, and allowing
Mr Hartright a second chance of escaping me. In brief, Fosco, at this serious
crisis, was untrue to himself. Deplorable and uncharacteristic fault! Behold
the cause, in my heart -- behold, in the image of Marian Halcombe, the
first and last weakness of Fosco's life!

<P>At the ripe age of sixty, I make this unparalleled confession. Youths!
I invoke your sympathy. Maidens! I claim your tears.

<P>A word more, and the attention of the reader (concentrated breathlessly
on myself) shall be released.

<P>My own mental insight informs me that three inevitable questions will
he asked here by persons of inquiring minds. They shall be stated -- they
shall be answered.

<P>First question. What is the secret of Madame Fosco's unhesitating devotion
of herself to the fulfilment of my boldest wishes, to the furtherance of
my deepest plans? I might answer this by simply referring to my own character,
and by asking, in my turn, Where, in the history of the world, has a man
of my order ever been found without a woman in the background self-immolated
on the altar of his life? But I remember that I am writing in England,
I remember that I was married in England, and I ask if a woman's marriage
obligations in this country pro vide for her private opinion of her husband's
principles? No! They charge her unreservedly to love, honour, and obey
him. That is exactly what my wife has done. I stand here on a supreme moral
elevation, and I loftily assert her accurate performance of her conjugal
duties. Silence, Calumny! Your sympathy, Wives of England, for Madame Fosco!

<P>Second question. If Anne Catherick had not died when she did, what should
I have done? I should, in that case, have assisted worn-out Nature in finding
permanent repose. I should have opened the doors of the Prison of Life,
and have extended to the captive (incurably afflicted in mind and body
both) a happy release.

<P>Third question. On a calm revision of all the circumstances -- Is my
conduct worthy of any serious blame? Most emphatically, No! Have I not
carefully avoided exposing myself to the odium of committing unnecessary
crime? With my vast resources in chemistry, I might have taken Lady Glyde's
life. At immense personal sacrifice I followed the dictates of my own ingenuity,
my own humanity, my own caution, and took her identity instead. Judge me
by what I might have done. How comparatively innocent! how indirectly virtuous
I appear in what I really did!

<P>I announced on beginning it that this narrative would be a remarkable
document. It has entirely answered my expectations. Receive these fervid
lines -- my last legacy to the country I leave for ever, They are worthy
of the occasion, and worthy of&nbsp;<l>FOSCO.

THE STORY CONCLUDED BY WALTER HARTRIGHT</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>
<H2>
I</H2></CENTER>
WHEN I closed the last leaf of the Count's manuscript the half-hour during
which I had engaged to remain at Sorest Road had expired. Monsieur Rubelle
looked at his watch and bowed. I rose immediately, and left the agent in
possession of the empty house. I never saw him again -- I never heard more
of him or of his wife. Out of the dark byways of villainy and deceit they
had crawled across our path -- into the same byways they crawled back secretly
and were lost.

<P>In a quarter of an hour after leaving Forest Road I was at home again.

<P>But few words sufficed to tell Laura and Marian how my desperate venture
had ended, and what the next event in our lives was likely to be. I left
all details to be described later in the day, and hastened back to St John's
Wood, to see the person of whom Count Fosco had ordered the fly, when he
went to meet Laura at the station.

<P>The address in my possession led me to some `livery stables,' about
a quarter of a mile distant from Sorest Road. The proprietor proved to
be a civil and respectable man. When I explained that an important family
matter obliged me to ask him to refer to his books for the purpose of ascertaining
a date with which the record of his business transactions might supply
me, he offered no objection to granting my request. The book was produced,
and there, under the date of `July 26th, 1850,' the order was entered in
these words --

<P>`Brougham to Count Fosco, 5 Sorest Road. Two o'clock (John Owen).'

<P>I found on inquiry that the name of `John Owen,' attached to the entry
referred to the man who had been employed to drive the fly. He was then
at work in the stable-yard, and was sent for to see me at my request.

<P>`Do you remember driving a gentleman, in the month of July last, from
Number Five Forest Road to the Waterloo Bridge station?' I asked

<P>`Well, sir,' said the man, `I can't exactly say I do.'

<P>`Perhaps you remember the gentleman himself? Can you call to mind driving
a foreigner last summer -- a tall gentleman and remarkably fat?' The man's
face brightened directly.

<P>`I remember him, sir! The fattest gentleman as ever I see, and the heaviest
customer as ever I drove. Yes, yes -- I call him to mind, sir! We did go
to the station, and it was from Forest Road. There was a parrot, or summat
like it, screeching in the window. The gentleman was in a mortal hurry
about the lady's luggage, and he gave me a handsome present for looking
sharp and getting the boxes.'

<P>Getting the boxes! I recollected immediately that Laura's own account
of herself on her arrival in London described her luggage as being collected
for her by some person whom Count Fosco brought with him to the station.
This was the man.

<P>`Did you see the lady?' I asked. `What did she look like? Was she young
or old?'

<P>`Well, sir, what with the hurry and the crowd of people pushing about,
I can't rightly say what the lady looked like. I can't call nothing to
mind about her that I know of -- excepting her name.

<P>`You remember her name?'

<P>`Yes, sir. Her name was Lady Glyde.'

<P>`How do you come to remember that, when you have forgotten what she
looked like?'

<P>The man smiled, and shifted his feet in some little embarrassment.

<P>`Why, to tell you the truth, sir,' he said, `I hadn't been long married
at that time, and my wife's name, before she changed it for mine, was the
same as the lady's -- meaning the name of Glyde, sir. The lady mentioned
it herself. ``IS your name on your boxes, ma'am?'' says I. ``Yes,'' says
she, ``my name is on my luggage -- it is Lady Glyde.'' ``Come!'' I says
to myself, ``I've a bad head for gentlefolks' names in general -- but this
one comes like an old friend, at any rate.'' I can't say nothing about
the time, sir, it might be nigh on a year ago, or it mightn't. But I can
swear to the stout gentleman, and swear to the lady's name.'

<P>There was no need that he should remember the time -- the date was positively
established by his master's order-book. I felt at once that the means were
now in my power of striking down the whole conspiracy at a blow with the
irresistible weapon of plain fact. Without a moment's hesitation, I took
the proprietor of the livery stables aside and told him what the real importance
was of the evidence of his order-book and the evidence of his driver. An
arrangement to compensate him for the temporary loss of the man's services
was easily made, and a copy of the entry in the book was taken by myself,
and certified as true by the master's own signature. I left the livery
stables, having settled that John Owen was to hold himself at my disposal
for the next three days, or for a longer period if necessity required it.

<P>I now had in my possession all the papers that I wanted -- the district
registrar's own copy of the certificate of death, and Sir Percival's dated
letter to the Count, being safe in my pocketbook.

<P>With this fresh evidence about me, and with the coachman's answers fresh
in my memory, I next turned my steps, for the first time since the beginning
of all my inquiries, in the direction of Mr Kyrle's office. One of my objects
in paying him this second visit was, necessarily, to tell him what I had
done. The other was to warn him of my resolution to take my wife to Limmeridge
the next morning, and to have her publicly received and recognised in her
uncle's house. I left it to Mr Kyrle to decide under these circumstances,
and in Mr Gilmore's absence, whether he was or was not bound, as the family
solicitor, to be present on that occasion in the family interests.

<P>I will say nothing of Mr Kyrle's amazement, or of the terms in which
he expressed his opinion of my conduct from the first stage of the investigation
to the last. It is only necessary to mention that he at once decided on
accompanying us to Cumberland.

<P>We started the next morning by the early train. Laura, Marian, Mr Kyrle,
and myself in one carriage, and John Owen with a clerk from Mr Kyrle's
office, occupying places in another. On reaching the Limmeridge station
we went first to the farmhouse at Todd's Corner. It was my firm determination
that Laura should not enter her uncle's house till she appeared there publicly
recognised as his niece. I left Marian to settle the question of accommodation
with Mrs Todd, as soon as the good woman had recovered from the bewilderment
of hearing what our errand was in Cumberland, and I arranged with her husband
that John Owen was to be committed to the ready hospitality of the farm-servants.
These preliminaries completed, Mr Kyrle and I set forth together for Limmeridge
House.

<P>I cannot write at any length of our interview with Mr Fairlie, for I
cannot recall it to mind without feelings of impatience and contempt, which
make the scene, even in remembrance only, utterly repulsive to me. I prefer
to record simply that I carried my point. Mr Fairlie attempted to treat
us on his customary plan. We passed without notice his polite insolence
at the outset of the interview. We heard without sympathy the protestations
with which he tried next to persuade us that the disclosure of the conspiracy
had overwhelmed him. He absolutely whined and whimpered at last like a
fretful child. `How was he to know that his niece was alive when he was
told that she was dead? He would welcome dear Laura with pleasure, if we
would only allow him time to recover. Did we think he looked as if he wanted
hurrying into his grave? No. Then, why hurry him?' He reiterated these
remonstrances at every available opportunity, until I checked them once
for all, by placing him firmly between two inevitable alternatives. I gave
him his choice between doing his niece justice on my terms, or facing the
consequence of a public assertion of her existence in a court of law. Mr
Kyrle, to whom he turned for help, told him plainly that he must decide
the question then and there. Characteristically choosing the alternative
which promised soonest to release him from all personal anxiety, he announced
with a sudden outburst of energy, that he was not strong enough to bear
any more bullying, and that we might do as we pleased.

<P>Mr Kyrle and I at once went downstairs, and agreed upon a form of letter
which was to be sent round to the tenants who had attended the false funeral,
summoning them, in Mr Fairlie's name, to assemble in Limmeridge House on
the next day but one. An order referring to the same date was also written,
directing a statuary in Carlisle to send a man to Limmeridge churchyard
for the purpose of erasing an inscription -- Mr Kyrle, who had arranged
to sleep in the house, undertaking that Mr Fairlie should hear these letters
read to him, and should sign them with his own hand.

<P>I occupied the interval day at the farm in writing a plain narrative
of the conspiracy, and in adding to it a statement of the practical contradiction
which facts offered to the assertion of Laura's death. This I submitted
to Mr Kyrle before I read it the next day to the assembled tenants. We
also arranged the form in which the evidence should be presented at the
close of the reading. After these matters were settled, Mr Kyrle endeavoured
to turn the conversation next to Laura's affairs. Knowing, and desiring
to know nothing of those affairs, and doubting whether he would approve,
as a man of business, of my conduct in relation to my wife's life-interest
in the legacy left to Madame Fosco, I begged Mr Kyrle to excuse me if I
abstained from discussing the subject. It was connected, as I could truly
tell him, with those sorrows and troubles of the past which we never referred
to among ourselves, and which we instinctively shrank from discussing with
others.

<P>My last labour, as the evening approached, was to obtain `The Narrative
of the Tombstone,' by taking a copy of the false inscription on the grave
before it was erased.

<P>The day came -- the day when Laura once more entered the familiar breakfast-room
at Limmeridge House. All the persons assembled rose from their seats as
Marian and I led her in. A perceptible shock of surprise, an audible murmur
of interest ran through them, at the sight of her face. Mr Fairlie was
present (by my express stipulation), with Mr Kyrle by his side. His valet
stood behind him with a smelling-bottle ready in one hand, and a white
handkerchief, saturated with eau-de-Cologne, in the other.

<P>I opened the proceedings by publicly appealing to Mr Fairlie to say
whether I appeared there with his authority and under his express sanction.
He extended an arm, on either side, to Mr Kyrle and to his valet -- was
by them assisted to stand on his legs, and then expressed himself in the
terms: `Allow me to present Mr Hartright. I am as great an invalid as ever,
and he is so very obliging as to speak for me. The subject is dreadfully
embarrassing. Please hear him, and don't make a noise!' With those words
he slowly sank back again into the chair, and took refuge in his scented
pocket-handkerchief.

<P>The disclosure of the conspiracy followed, after I had offered my preliminary
explanation, first of all, in the fewest and the plainest words. I was
there present (I informed my hearers) to declare, first, that my wife,
then sitting by me, was the daughter of the late Mr Philip Fairlie; secondly,
to prove by positive facts, that the funeral which they had attended in
Limmeridge churchyard was the funeral of another woman; thirdly, to give
them a plain account of how it had happened. Without further preface, I
at once read the narrative of the conspiracy, describing it in clear outline,
and dwelling only upon the pecuniary motive for it, in order to avoid complicating
my statement by unnecessary reference to Sir Percival's secret. This done,
I reminded my audience of the date on the inscription in the churchyard
(the 25th). and confirmed its correctness by producing the certificate
of death. I then read them Sir Percival's letter of the 25th, announcing
his wife's intended journey from Hampshire to London on the 26th. I next
showed that she had taken that journey, by the personal testimony of the
driver of the fly, and I proved that she had performed it on the appointed
day, by the order-book at the livery stables. Marian then added her own
statement of the meeting between Laura and herself at the mad-house, and
of her sister's escape. After which I closed the proceedings by informing
the persons present of Sir Percival's death and of my marriage.

<P>Mr Kyrle rose when I resumed my seat, and declared, as the legal adviser
of the family, that my case was proved by the plainest evidence he had
ever heard in his life. As he spoke those words, I put my arm round Laura,
and raised her so that she was plainly visible to every one in the room.
`Are you all of the same opinion?' I asked, advancing towards them a few
steps, and pointing to my wife.

<P>The effect of the question was electrical. Far down at the lower end
of the room one of the oldest tenants on the estate started to his feet,
and led the rest with him in an instant. I see the man now, with his honest
brown face and his iron-grey hair, mounted on the window-seat, waving his
heavy riding-whip over his head, and leading the cheers. `There she is,
alive and hearty -- God bless her! Gi' it tongue, lads! Gi' it tongue!'
The shout that answered him, reiterated again and again, was the sweetest
music I ever heard. The labourers in the village and the boys from the
school, assembled on the lawn, caught up the cheering and echoed it hack
on us. The farmers' wives clustered round Laura, and struggled which should
be first to shake hands with her, and to implore her, with the tears pouring
over their own cheeks, to bear up bravely and not to cry. She was so completely
overwhelmed, that I was obliged to take her from them, and carry her to
the door. There I gave her into Marian's care -- Marian, who had never
failed us yet, whose courageous self-control did not fail us now. Left
by myself at the door, I invited all the persons present (after thanking
them in Laura's name and mine) to follow me to the churchyard, and see
the false inscription struck off the tombstone with their own eyes.

<P>They all left the house, and all joined the throng of villagers collected
round the grave, where the statuary's man was waiting for us. In a breathless
silence, the first sharp stroke of the steel sounded on the marble. Not
a voice was heard -- not a soul moved, till those three words, `Laura,
Lady Glyde,' had vanished from sight. Then there was a great heave of relief
among the crowd, as if they felt that the last fetters of the conspiracy
had been struck off Laura herself, and the assembly slowly withdrew. It
was late in the day before the whole inscription was erased. One line only
was afterwards engraved in its place : `Anne Catherick, July 25th, 1850.'

<P>I returned to Limmeridge House early enough in the evening to take leave
of Mr Kyrle. He and his clerk, and the driver of the fly, went back to
London by the night train. On their departure an insolent message was delivered
to me from Mr Fairlie -- who had been carried from the room in a shattered
condition, when the first outbreak of cheering answered my appeal to the
tenantry. The message conveyed to us `Mr Fairlie's best congratulations,'
and requested to know whether `we contemplated stopping in the house.'
I sent back word that the only object for which we had entered his doors
was accomplished -- that I contemplated stopping in no man's house but
my own -- and that Mr Fairlie need not entertain the slightest apprehension
of ever seeing us or hearing from us again. We went back to our friends
at the farm to rest that night, and the next morning -- escorted to the
station, with the heartiest enthusiasm and good will, by the whole village
and by all the farmers in the neighbourhood -- we returned to London.

<P>As our view of the Cumberland hills faded in the distance, I thought
of the first disheartening circumstances under which the long struggle
that was now past and over had been pursued. It was strange to look back
and to see, now, that the poverty which had denied us all hope of assistance
had been the indirect means of our success, by forcing me to act for myself.
If we had been rich enough to find legal help, what would have been the
result? The gain (on Mr Kyrle's own showing) would have been more than
doubtful -- the loss, judging by the plain test of events as they had really
happened, certain. The law would never have obtained me my interview with
Mrs Catherick. The law would never have made Pesca the means of forcing
a confession from the Count.
<CENTER>
<H2>
II</H2></CENTER>
Two more events remain to be added to the chain before it reaches fairly
from the outset of the story to the close.

<P>While our new sense of freedom from the long oppression of the past
was still strange to us, I was sent for by the friend who had given me
my first employment in wood engraving, to receive from him a fresh testimony
of his regard for my welfare. He had been commissioned by his employers
to go to Paris, and to examine for them a fresh discovery in the practical
application of his Art, the merits of which they were anxious to ascertain.
His own engagements had not allowed him leisure time to undertake the errand,
and he had most kindly suggested that it should be transferred to me. I
could have no hesitation in thankfully accepting the offer, for if I acquitted
myself of my commission as I hoped I should, the result would be a permanent
engagement on the illustrated newspaper, to which I was now only occasionally
attached.

<P>I received my instructions and packed up for the journey the next day.
On leaving Laura once more (under what changed circumstances!) in her sister's
care, a serious consideration recurred to me, which had more than once
crossed my wife's mind, as well as my own, already -- I mean the consideration
of Marian's future. Had we any right to let our selfish affection accept
the devotion of all that generous life? Was it not our duty, our best expression
of gratitude, to forget ourselves, and to think only of her? I tried to
say this when we were alone for a moment, before I went away. She took
my hand, and silenced me at the first words.

<P>`After all that we three have suffered together,' she said, `there can
be no parting between us till the last parting of all. My heart and my
happiness, Walter, are with Laura and you. Wait a little till there are
children's voices at your fireside. I will teach them to speak for me in
their language, and the first lesson they say to their father and mother
shall be -- We can't spare our aunt!'

<P>My journey to Paris was not undertaken alone. At the eleventh hour Pesca
decided that he would accompany me. He had not recovered his customary
cheerfulness since the night at the Opera, and he determined to try what
a week's holiday would do to raise his spirits.

<P>I performed the errand entrusted to me, and drew out the necessary report,
on the fourth day from our arrival in Paris. The fifth day I arranged to
devote to sight-seeing and amusements in Pesca's company.

<P>Our hotel had been too full to accommodate us both on the same floor.
My room was on the second storey, and Pesca's was above me, on the third.
On the morning of the fifth day I went upstairs to see if the Professor
was ready to go out. rust before I reached the landing I saw his door opened
from the inside -- a long, delicate, nervous hand (not my friend's hand
certainly) held it ajar. At the same time I heard Pesca's voice saying
eagerly, in low tones, and in his own language -- `I remember the name,
but I don't know the man. You saw at the Opera he was so changed that I
could not recognise him. I will forward the report -- I can do no more.'
`No more need be done,' answered the second voice. The door opened wide,
and the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek -- the man I had seen
following Count Fosco's cab a week before -- came out. He bowed as I drew
aside to let him pass -- his face was fearfully pale -- and he held fast
by the banisters as he descended the stairs.

<P>I pushed open the door and entered Pesca's room. He was crouched up,
in the strangest manner, in a corner of the sofa. He seemed to shrink from
me when I approached him.

<P>`Am I disturbing you?' I asked. `I did not know you had a friend with
you till I saw him come out.'

<P>`No friend,' said Pesca eagerly. `I see him today for the first time
and the last.'

<P>`I am afraid he has brought you bad news?'

<P>`Horrible news, Walter! Let us go back to London -- I don't want to
stop here -- I am sorry I ever came. The misfortunes of my youth are very
hard upon me,' he said, turning his face to the wall, `very hard upon me
in my later time. I try to forget them -- and they will not forget me!'

<P>`We can't return, I am afraid, before the afternoon,' I replied. `Would
you like to come out with me in the meantime?'

<P>`No, my friend, I will wait here. But let us go back today -- pray let
us go back.'

<P>I left him with the assurance that he should leave Paris that afternoon.
We had arranged the evening before to ascend the Cathedral of Notre Dame,
with Victor Hugo's noble romance for our guide. There was nothing in the
French capital that I was more anxious to see, and I departed by myself
for the church.

<P>Approaching Notre Dame by the river-side, I passed on my way the terrible
dead-house of paris -- the Morgue. A great crowd clamoured and heaved round
the door. There was evidently something inside which excited the popular
curiosity, and fed the popular appetite for horror.

<P>I should have walked on to the church if the conversation of two men
and a woman on the outskirts of the crowd had not caught my ear. They had
just come out from seeing the sight in the Morgue, and the account they
were giving of the dead body to their neighbours described it as the corpse
of a man -- a man of immense size, with a strange mark on his left arm.

<P>The moment those words reached me I stopped and took my place with the
crowd going in. Some dim foreshadowing of the truth had crossed my mind
when I heard Pesca's voice through the open door, and when I saw the stranger's
face as he passed me on the stairs of the hotel. Now the truth itself was
revealed to me -- revealed in the chance words that had just reached my
ears. Other vengeance than mine had followed that fated man from the theatre
to his own door -- from his own door to his refuge in Paris. Other vengeance
than mine had called him to the day of reckoning, and had exacted from
him the penalty of his life. The moment when I had pointed him out to Pesca
at the theatre in the hearing of that stranger by our side, who was looking
for him too -- was the moment that sealed his doom. I remembered the struggle
in my own heart, when he and I stood face to face -- the struggle before
I could let him escape me -- and shuddered as I recalled it.

<P>Slowly, inch by inch, I pressed in with the crowd, moving nearer and
nearer to the great glass screen that parts the dead from the living at
the Morgue -- nearer and nearer, till I was close behind the front row
of spectators, and could look in.

<P>There he lay, unowned, unknown, exposed to the flippant curiosity of
a French mob! There was the dreadful end of that long life of degraded
ability and heartless crime! Hushed in the sublime repose of death, the
broad, firm, massive face and head fronted us so grandly that the chattering
Frenchwomen about me lifted their hands in admiration, and cried in shrill
chorus, `Ah, what a handsome man!' The wound that had killed him had been
struck with a knife or dagger exactly over his heart. No other traces of
violence appeared about the body except on the left arm, and there, exactly
in the place where I had seen the brand on Pesca's arm, were two deep cuts
in the shape of the letter T, which entirely obliterated the mark of the
Brotherhood. His clothes, hung above him, showed that he had been himself
conscious of his danger -- they were clothes that had disguised him as
a French artisan. For a few moments, but not for longer, I forced myself
to see these things through the glass screen. I can write of them at no
greater length, for I saw no more.

<P>The few facts in connection with his death which I subsequently ascertained
(partly from Pesca and partly from other sources), may be stated here before
the subject is dismissed from these pages.

<P>His body was taken out of the Seine in the disguise which I have described,
nothing being found on him which revealed his name, his rank, or his place
of abode. The hand that struck him was never traced, and the circumstances
under which he was killed were never discovered. I leave others to draw
their own conclusions in reference to the secret of the assassination as
I have drawn mine. When I have intimated that the foreigner with the scar
was a member of the Brotherhood (admitted in Italy after Pesca's departure
from his native country), and when I have further added that the two cuts,
in the form of a T, on the left arm of the dead man, signified the Italian
word `Traditore,' and showed that justice had been done by the Brotherhood
on a traitor, I have contributed all that I know towards elucidating the
mystery of Count Fosco's death.

<P>The body was identified the day after I had seen it by means of an anonymous
letter addressed to his wife. He was buried by Madame Fosco in the cemetery
of Pere la Chaise. Fresh funeral wreaths continue to this day to be hung
on the ornamental bronze railings round the tomb by the Countess's own
hand. She lives in the strictest retirement at Versailles. Not long since
she published a biography of her deceased husband. The work throws no light
whatever on the name that was really his own or on the secret history of
his life -- it is almost entirely devoted to the praise of his domestic
virtues, the assertion of his rare abilities, and the enumeration of the
honours conferred on him. The circumstances attending his death are very
briefly noticed, and are summed up on the last page in this sentence --
`His life was one long assertion of the rights of the aristocracy and the
sacred principles of Order, and he died a martyr to his cause.'
<CENTER>
<H2>
III</H2></CENTER>
The summer and autumn passed after my return from Paris, and brought no
changes with them which need be noticed here. We lived so simply and quietly
that the income which I was now steadily earning sufficed for all our wants.

<P>In the February of the new year our first child was born -- a son. My
mother and sister and Mrs Vesey were our guests at the little christening
party, and Mrs Clements was present to assist my wife on the same occasion.
Marian was our boy's godmother, and Pesca and Mr Gilmore (the latter acting
by proxy) were his godfathers. I may add here that when Mr Gilmore returned
to us a year later he assisted the design of these pages, at my request,
by writing the Narrative which appears early in the story under his name,
and which, though first in order of precedence, was thus, in order of time,
the last that I received.

<P>The only event in our lives which now remains to be recorded, occurred
when our little Walter was six months old,

<P>At that time I was sent to Ireland to make sketches for certain forthcoming
illustrations in the newspaper to which I was attached. I was away for
nearly a fortnight, corresponding regularly with my wife and Marian, except
during the last three days of my absence, when my movements were too uncertain
to enable me to receive letters. I performed the latter part of my journey
back at night, and when I reached home in the morning, to my utter astonishment
there was no one to receive me. Laura and Marian and the child had left
the house on the day before my return.

<P>A note from my wife, which was given to me by the servant, only increased
my surprise, by informing me that they had gone to Limmeridge House. Marian
had prohibited any attempt at written explanations -- I was entreated to
follow them the moment I came back -- complete enlightenment awaited me
on my arrival in Cumberland -- and I was forbidden to feel the slightest
anxiety in the meantime. There the note ended. It was still early enough
to catch the morning train. I reached Limmeridge House the same afternoon.

<P>My wife and Marian were both upstairs. They had established themselves
(by way of completing my amazement) in the little room which had been once
assigned to me for a studio, when I was employed on Mr Fairlie's drawings.
On the very chair which I used to occupy when I was at work Marian was
sitting now, with the child industriously sucking his coral upon her lap
-- while Laura was standing by the well-remembered drawing-table which
I had so often used, with the little album that I had filled for her in
past times open under her hand.

<P>`What in the name of heaven has brought you here?' I asked. `Does Mr
Fairlie know --?'

<P>Marian suspended the question on my lips by telling me that Mr Fairlie
was dead. He had been struck by paralysis, and had never rallied after
the shock. Mr Kyrle had informed them of his death, and had advised them
to proceed immediately to Limmeridge House.

<P>Some dim perception of a great change dawned on my mind. Laura spoke
before I had quite realised it. She stole close to me to enjoy the surprise
which was still expressed in my face.

<P>`My darling Walter,' she said, `must we really account for our boldness
in coming here? I am afraid, love, I can only explain it by breaking through
our rule, and referring to the past.'

<P>`There is not the least necessity for doing anything of the kind,' said
Marian. `We can be just as explicit, and much more interesting, by referring
to the future.' She rose and held up the child kicking and crowing in her
arms. `Do you know who this is, Walter?' she asked, with bright tears of
happiness gathering in her eyes.

<P>`Even my bewilderment has its limits,' I replied. `I think I can still
answer for knowing my own child.'

<P>`Child!' she exclaimed, with all her easy gaiety of old times. `Do you
talk in that familiar manner of one of the landed gentry of England? Are
you aware, when I present this illustrious baby to your notice, in whose
presence you stand? Evidently not! Let me make two eminent personages known
to one another: Mr Walter Hartright -- <I>the Heir of Limmeridge</I>.'

<P>So she spoke. In writing those last words, I have written all. The pen
falters in my hand. The long, happy labour of many months is over. Marian
was the good angel of our lives -- let Marian end our Story.
