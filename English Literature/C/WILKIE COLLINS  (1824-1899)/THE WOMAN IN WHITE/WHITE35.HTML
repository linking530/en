The inquest was hurried for certain local reasons which weighed with the
coroner and the town authorities. It was held on the afternoon of the next
day. I was necessarily one among the witnesses summoned to assist the objects
of the investigation.

<P>My first proceeding in the morning was to go to the post-office, and
inquire for the letter which I expected from Marian. No change of circumstances,
however extraordinary, could affect the one great anxiety which weighed
on my mind while I was away from London. The morning's letter, which was
the only assurance I could receive that no misfortune had happened in my
absence, was still the absorbing interest with which my day began.

<P>To my relief, the letter from Marian was at the office waiting for me.

<P>Nothing had happened -- they were both as safe and as well as when I
had left them. Laura sent her love, and begged that I would let her know
of my return a day beforehand. Her sister added, in explanation of this
message, that she had saved `nearly a sovereign' out of her own private
purse, and that she had claimed the privilege of ordering the dinner and
giving the dinner which was to celebrate the day of my return. I read these
little domestic confidences in the bright morning with the terrible recollection
of what had happened the evening before vivid in my memory. The necessity
of sparing Laura any sudden knowledge of the truth was the first consideration
which the letter suggested to me. I wrote at once to Marian to tell her
what I have told in these pages -- presenting the tidings as gradually
and gently as I could, and warning her not to let any such thing as a newspaper
fall in Laura's way while I was absent. In the case of any other woman,
less courageous and less reliable, I might have hesitated before I ventured
on unreservedly disclosing the whole truth. But I owed it to Marian to
be faithful to my past experience of her, and to trust her as I trusted
myself.

<P>My letter was necessarily a long one. It occupied me until the time
came for proceeding to the inquest.

<P>The objects of the legal inquiry were necessarily beset by peculiar
complications and difficulties. Resides the investigation into the manner
in which the deceased had met his death, there were serious questions to
be settled relating to the cause of the fire, to the abstraction of the
keys, and to the presence of a stranger in the vestry at the time when
the flames broke out. Even the identification of the dead man had not yet
been accomplished. The helpless condition of the servant had made the police
distrustful of his asserted recognition of his master. They had sent to
Knowlesbury over-night to secure the attendance of witnesses who were well
acquainted with the personal appearance of Sir Percival Glyde, and they
had communicated, the first thing in the morning, with Blackwater Park.
These precautions enabled the coroner and jury to settle the question of
identity, and to confirm the correctness of the servant's assertion; the
evidence offered by competent witnesses, and by the discovery of certain
facts, being subsequently strengthened by an examination of the dead man's
watch. The crest and the name of Sir Percival Glyde were engraved inside
it.

<P>The next inquiries related to the fire.

<P>The servant and I, and the boy who had heard the light struck in the
vestry, were the first witnesses called. The boy gave his evidence clearly
enough, but the servant's mind had not yet recovered the shock inflicted
on it -- he was plainly incapable of assisting the objects of the inquiry,
and he was desired to stand down.

<P>To my own relief, my examination was not a long one. I had not known
the deceased -- I had never seen him -- I was not aware of his presence
at Old Welmingham -- and I had not been in the vestry at the finding of
the body. All I could prove was that I had stopped at the clerk's cottage
to ask my way -- that I had heard from him of the loss of the keys -- that
I had accompanied him to the church to render what help I could -- that
I had seen the fire -- that I had heard some person unknown, inside the
vestry, trying vainly to unlock the door -- and that I had done what I
could, from motives of humanity, to save the man. Other witnesses, who
had been acquainted with the deceased, were asked if they could explain
the mystery of his presumed abstraction of the keys, and his presence in
the burning room. But the coroner seemed to take it for granted, naturally
enough, that I, as a total stranger in the neighbourhood, and a total stranger
to Sir Percival Glyde, could not be in a position to offer any evidence
on these two points.

<P>The course that I was myself bound to take, when my formal examination
had closed, seemed clear to me. I did not feel called on to volunteer any
statement of my own private convictions, in the first place, because my
doing so could serve no practical purpose, now that all proof in support
of any surmises of mine was burnt with the burnt register; in the second
place, because I could not have intelligibly stated my opinion -- my unsupported
opinion -- without disclosing the whole story of the conspiracy, and producing
beyond a doubt the same unsatisfactory effect on the mind of the coroner
and the jury, which I had already produced on the mind of Mr Kyrle.

<P>In these pages, however, and after the time that has now elapsed, no
such cautions and restraints as are here described need fetter the free
expression of my opinion. I will state briefly, before my pen occupies
itself with other events, how my own convictions lead me to account for
the abstraction of the keys, for the outbreak of the fire, and for the
death of the man.

<P>The news of my being free on bail drove Sir Percival, as I believe.
to his last resources. The attempted attack on the road was one of those
resources, and the suppression of all practical proof of his crime, by
destroying the page of the register on which the forgery had been committed,
was the other, and the surest of the two. If I could produce no extract
from the original book to compare with the certified copy at Knowlesbury,
I could produce no positive evidence, and could threaten him with no fatal
exposure. All that was necessary to the attainment of his end was, that
he should get into the vestry unperceived, that he should tear out the
page in the register, and that he should leave the vestry again as privately
as he had entered it.

<P>On this supposition, it is easy to understand why he waited until nightfall
before he made the attempt, and why he took advantage of the clerk's absence
to possess himself of the keys. Necessity would oblige him to strike a
light to find his way to the right register, and common caution would suggest
his locking the door on the inside in case of intrusion on the part of
any inquisitive stranger, or on my part, if I happened to be in the neighbourhood
at the time.

<P>I cannot believe that it was any part of his intention to make the destruction
of the register appear to be the result of accident, by purposely setting
the vestry on fire. The bare chance that prompt assistance might arrive,
and that the books might, by the remotest possibility, be saved, would
have been enough, on a moment's consideration, to dismiss any idea of this
sort from his mind. Remembering the quantity of combustible objects in
the vestry -- the straw, the papers, the packing-cases, the dry wood, the
old worm-eaten presses -- all the probabilities, in my estimation, point
to the fire as the result of an accident with his matches or his light.

<P>His first impulse, under these circumstances, was doubtless to try to
extinguish the flames, and failing in that, his second impulse (ignorant
as he was of the state of the lock) had been to attempt to escape by the
door which had given him entrance. When I had called to him, the flames
must have reached across the door leading into the church, on either side
of which the presses extended, and close to which the other combustible
objects were placed. In all probability, the smoke and flame (confined
as they were to the room) had been too much for him when he tried to escape
by the inner door. He must have dropped in his death-swoon, he must have
sunk in the place where he was found, just as I got on the roof to break
the skylight window. Even if we had been able, afterwards, to get into
the church, and to burst open the door from that side, the delay must have
been fatal. He would have been past saving, long past saving, by that time.
We should only have given the flames free ingress into the church -- the
church, which was now preserved, but which, in that event, would have shared
the fate of the vestry. There is no doubt in my mind, there can be no doubt
in the mind of any one, that he was a dead man before ever we got to the
empty cottage, and worked with might and main to tear down the beam.

<P>This is the nearest approach that any theory of mine can make towards
accounting for a result which was visible matter of fact. As I have described
them, so events passed to us outside. As I have related it, so his body
was found.

<P>The inquest was adjourned over one day -- no explanation that the eye
of the law could recognise having been discovered thus far to account for
the mysterious circumstances of the case.

<P>It was arranged that more witnesses should be summoned, and that the
London solicitor of the deceased should be invited to attend. A medical
man was also charged with the duty of reporting on the mental condition
of the servant, which appeared at present to debar him from giving any
evidence of the least importance. He could only declare, in a dazed way,
that he had been ordered, on the night of the fire, to wait in the lane,
and that he knew nothing else, except that the deceased was certainly his
master.

<P>My own impression was, that he had been first used (without any guilty
knowledge on his own part) to ascertain the fact of the clerk's absence
from home on the previous day, and that he had been afterwards ordered
to wait near the church (but out of sight of the vestry) to assist his
master, in the event of my escaping the attack on the road, and of a collision
occurring between Sir Percival and myself. It is necessary to add, that
the man's own testimony was never obtained to confirm this view. The medical
report of him declared that what little mental faculty he possessed was
seriously shaken; nothing satisfactory was extracted from him at the adjourned
inquest, and for aught I know to the contrary, he may never have recovered
to this day.

<P>I returned to the hotel at Welmingham so jaded in body and mind, so
weakened and depressed by all that I had gone through, as to be quite unfit
to endure the local gossip about the inquest, and to answer the trivial
questions that the talkers addressed to me in the coffee-room. I withdrew
from my scanty dinner to my cheap garret-chamber to secure myself a little
quiet, and to think undisturbed of Laura and Marian.

<P>If I had been a richer man I would have gone back to London, and would
have comforted myself with a sight of the two dear faces again that night.
But I was bound to appear, if called on, at the adjourned inquest, and
doubly bound to answer my bail before the magistrate at Knowlesbury. Our
slender resources had suffered already, and the doubtful future -- more
doubtful than ever now -- made me dread decreasing our means unnecessarily
by allowing myself an indulgence even at the small cost of a double railway
journey in the carriages of the second class.

<P>The next day -- the day immediately following the inquest -- was left
at my own disposal. I began the morning by again applying at the post-office
for my regular report from Marian. It was waiting for me as before, and
it was written throughout in good spirits. I read the letter thankfully,
and then set forth with my mind at ease for the day to go to Old Welmingham,
and to view the scene of the fire by the morning light.

<P>What changes met me when I got there!

<P>Through all the ways of our unintelligible world the trivial and terrible
walk hand in hand together. The irony of circumstances holds no mortal
catastrophe in respect. When I reached the church, the trampled condition
of the burial-ground was the only serious trace left to tell of the fire
and the death. A rough hoarding of boards had been knocked up before the
vestry doorway. Rude caricatures were scrawled on it already, and the village
children were fighting and shouting for the possession of the best peep-hole
to see through. On the spot where I had heard the cry for help from the
burning room, on the spot where the panic-stricken servant had dropped
on his knees, a fussy flock of poultry was now scrambling for the first
choice of worms after the rain; and on the ground at my feet, where the
door and its dreadful burden had been laid, a workman's dinner was waiting
for him, tied up in a yellow basin, and his faithful cur in charge was
yelping at me for coming near the food. The old clerk, looking idly at
the slow commencement of the repairs, had only one interest that he could
talk about now -- the interest of escaping all blame for his own part on
account of the accident that had happened. One of the village women, whose
white wild face I remembered the picture of terror when we pulled down
the beam, was giggling with another woman, the picture of inanity, over
an old washing-tub. There is nothing serious in mortality I Solomon in
all his glory was Solomon with the elements of the contemptible lurking
in every fold of his robes and in every corner of his palace.

<P>As I left the place, my thoughts turned, not for the first time, to
the complete overthrow that all present hope of establishing Laura's identity
had now suffered through Sir Percival's death. He was gone -- and with
him the chance was gone which had been the one object of all my labours
and all my hopes.

<P>Could I look at my failure from no truer point of view than this?

<P>Suppose he had lived, would that change of circumstances have altered
the result? Could I have made my discovery a marketable commodity, even
for Laura's sake, after I had found out that robbery of the rights of others
was the essence of Sir Percival's crime? Could I have offered the price
of my silence for his confession of the conspiracy, when the effect of
that silence must have been to keep the right heir from the estates, and
the right owner from the name? Impossible! If Sir Percival had lived, the
discovery, from which (in ray ignorance of the true nature of the Secret)
I had hoped so much, could not have been mine to suppress or to make public,
as I thought best, for the vindication of Laura's rights. In common honesty
and common honour I must have gone at once to the stranger whose birthright
had been usurped -- I must have renounced the victory at the moment when
it was mine by placing my discovery unreservedly in that stranger's hands
-- and I must have faced afresh all the difficulties which stood between
me and the one object of my life, exactly as I was resolved in my heart
of hearts to face them now!

<P>I returned to Welmingham with my mind composed, feeling more sure of
myself and my resolution than I had felt yet.

<P>On my way to the hotel I passed the end of the square in which Mrs Catherick
lived. Should I go back to the house, and make another attempt to see her.
No. That news of Sir Percival's death, which was the last news she ever
expected to hear, must have reached her hours since. All the proceedings
at the inquest had been reported in the local paper that morning -- there
was nothing I could tell her which she did not know already. My interest
in making her speak had slackened. I remembered the furtive hatred in her
face when she said, `There is no news of Sir percival that I don't expect
-- except the news of his death.' I remembered the stealthy interest in
her eyes when they settled on me at parting, after she had spoken those
words. Some instinct, deep in my heart, which I felt to be a true one,
made the prospect of again entering her presence repulsive to me -- I turned
away from the square, and went straight back to the hotel.

<P>Some hours later, while I was resting in the coffee-room, a letter was
placed in my hands by the waiter. It was addressed to me by name, and I
found on inquiry that it had been left at the bar by a woman just as it
was near dusk, and just before the gas was lighted. She had said nothing,
and she had gone away again before there was time to speak to her, or even
to notice whom she was.

<P>I opened the letter. It was neither dated nor signed, and the handwriting
was palpably disguised. Before I had read the first sentence, however,
I knew who my correspondent was -- Mrs Catherick.

<P>The letter ran as follows -- I copy it exactly, word for word:
<CENTER>
<H2>
THE STORY CONTINUED BY MRS CATHERICK</H2></CENTER>
SIR, -- You have not come back, as you said you would. No matter -- I know
the news, and I write to tell you so. Did you see anything particular in
my face when you left me? I was wondering, in my own mind, whether the
day of his downfall had come at last, and whether you were the chosen instrument
for working it. You were, and you have worked it.

<P>You were weak enough, as I have heard, to try and save his life. If
you had succeeded, I should have looked upon you as my enemy. Now you have
failed, I hold you as my friend. Your inquiries frightened him into the
vestry by night -- your inquiries, without your privity and against your
will, have served the hatred and wreaked the vengeance of three-and-twenty
years. Thank you, sir, in spite of yourself.

<P>I owe something to the man who has done this. How can I pay my debt?
If I was a young woman still I might say, `Come, put your arm round my
waist, and kiss me, if you like.' I should have been fond enough of you
even to go that length, and you would have accepted my invitation -- you
would, sir, twenty years ago! But I am an old woman now. Well! I can satisfy
your curiosity, and pay my debt in that way. You had a great curiosity
to know certain private affairs of mine when you came to see me -- private
affairs which all your sharpness could not look into without my help --
private affairs which you have not discovered' even now. You <I>shall</I>
discover them -- your curiosity shall be satisfied. I will take any trouble
to please you, my estimable young friend!

<P>You were a little boy, I suppose, in the year twenty-seven? I was a
handsome young woman at that time, living at Old Welmingham. I had a contemptible
fool for a husband. I had also the honour of being acquainted (never mind
how) with a certain gentleman (never mind whom). I shall not call him by
his name. Why should I? It was not his own. He never had a name: you know
that, by this time, as well as I do.

<P>It will be more to the purpose to tell you how he worked himself into
my good graces. I was born with the tastes of a lady, and he gratified
them -- in other words, he admired me, and he made me presents. No woman
can resist admiration and presents -- especially presents, provided they
happen to be just the thing she wants. He was sharp enough to know that
-- most men are. Naturally he wanted something in return -- all men do.
And what do you think was the something? The merest trifle. Nothing but
the key of the vestry, and the key of the press inside it, when my husband's
back was turned. Of course he lied when I asked him why he wished me to
get him the keys in that private way. He might have saved himself the trouble
-- I didn't believe him. But I liked my presents, and I wanted more. So
I got him the keys, without my husband's knowledge, and I watched him,
without his own knowledge. Once, twice, four times I watched him, and the
fourth time I found him out.

<P>I was never over-scrupulous where other people's affairs were concerned,
and I was not over-scrupulous about his adding one to the marriages in
the register on his own account.

<P>Of course I knew it was wrong, but it did no harm to <I>me</I>, which
was one good reason for not making a fuss about it. And I had not got a
gold watch and chain, which was another, still better -- and he had promised
me one from London only the day before, which was a third, best of all.
If I had known what the law considered the crime to be, and how the law
punished it, I should have taken proper care of myself, and have exposed
him then and there. But I knew nothing, and I longed for the gold watch.
All the conditions I insisted on were that he should take me into his confidence
and tell me everything. I was as curious about his affairs then as you
are about mine now. He granted my conditions -- why, you will see presently.

<P>This, put in short, is what I heard from him. He did not willingly tell
me all that I tell you here. I drew some of it from him by persuasion and
some of it by questions. I was determined to have all the truth, and I
believe I got it.

<P>He knew no more than any one else of what the state of things really
was between his father and mother till after his mother's death. Then his
father confessed it, and promised to do what he could for his son. He died
having done nothing -- not having even made a will. The son (who can blame
him?) wisely provided for himself. He came to England at once, and took
possession of the property. There was no one to suspect him, and no one
to say him nay. His father and mother had always lived as man and wife
-- none of the few people who were acquainted with them ever supposed them
to be anything else. The right person to claim the property (if the truth
had been known) was a distant relation, who had no idea of ever getting
it, and who was away at sea when his father died. He had no difficulty
so far -- he took possession, as a matter of course. But he could not borrow
money on the property as a matter of course. There were two things wanted
of him before he could do this. One was a certificate of his birth, and
the other was a certificate of his parents' marriage. The certificate of
his birth was easily got -- he was born abroad, and the certificate was
there in due form. The other matter was a difficulty, and that difficulty
brought him to Old Welmingham.

<P>But for one consideration he might have gone to Knowlesbury instead.

<P>His mother had been living there just before she met with his father
-- living under her maiden name, the truth being that she was really a
married woman, married in Ireland, where her husband had ill-used her,
and had afterwards gone off with some other person. I give you this fact
on good authority -- Sir Felix mentioned it to his son as the reason why
he had not married. You may wonder why the son, knowing that his parents
had met each other at Knowlesbury, did not play his first tricks with the
register of that church, where it might have been fairly presumed his father
and mother were married. The reason was that the clergyman who did duty
at Knowlesbury church, in the year eighteen hundred and three (when, according
to his birth certificate, his father and mother ought to have been married),
was alive still when he took possession of the property in the New Year
of eighteen hundred and twenty-seven. This awkward circumstance forced
him to extend his inquiries to our neighbourhood. There no such danger
existed, the former clergyman at our church having been dead for some years.

<P>Old Welmingham suited his purpose as well as Knowlesbury. His father
had removed his mother from Knowlesbury, and had lived with her at a cottage
on the river, a little distance from our village. People who had known
his solitary ways when he was single did not wonder at his solitary ways
when he was supposed to be married. If he had not been a hideous creature
to look it, his retired life with the lady might have raised suspicions;
but, as things were, his hiding his ugliness and his deformity in the strictest
privacy surprised nobody. He lived in our neighbourhood till he came in
possession of the Park. After three or four and twenty years had passed,
who was to say (the clergyman being dead) that his marriage had not been
as private as the rest of his life, and that it had not taken place at
Old Welmimgham church?

<P>So, as I told you, the son found our neighbourhood the surest place
he could choose to set things right secretly in his own interests. It may
surprise you to hear that what he really did to the marriage register was
done on the spur of the moment -- done on second thoughts.

<P>His first notion was only to tear the leaf out (in the right year and
month), to destroy it privately, to go back to London, and to tell the
lawyers to get him the necessary certificate of his father's marriage,
innocently referring them of course to the date on the leaf that was gone.
Nobody could say his father and mother had not been married after that,
and whether, under the circumstances, they would stretch a point or not
about lending him the money (he thought they would), he had his answer
ready at all events, if a question was ever raised about his right to the
name and the estate.

<P>But when he came to look privately at the register for himself, he found
at the bottom of one of the pages for the year eighteen hundred and three
a blank space left, seemingly through there being no room to make a long
entry there, which was made instead at the top of the next page. The sight
of this chance altered all his plans. It was an opportunity he had never
hoped for, or thought of -- and he took it -- you know how. The blank space,
to have exactly tallied with his birth certificate, ought to have occurred
in the July part of the register. It occurred in the September part instead.
However, in this case, if suspicious questions were asked, the answer was
not hard to find. He had only to describe himself as a seven months' child.

<P>I was fool enough, when he told me his story, to feel some interest
and some pity for him -- which was just what he calculated on, as you will
see. I thought him hardly used. It was not his fault that his father and
mother were not married, and it was not his father's and mother's fault
either. A more scrupulous woman than I was -- a woman who had not set her
heart on a gold watch and chain -- would have found some excuses for him.
At all events, I held my tongue, and helped to screen what he was about.

<P>He was some time getting the ink the right colour (mixing it over and
over again in pots and bottles of mine), and some time afterwards in practising
the handwriting. But he succeeded in the end, and made an honest woman
of his mother after she was dead in her grave! So far, I don't deny that
he behaved honourably enough to myself. He gave me my watch and chain,
and spared no expense in buying them; both were of superior workmanship,
and very expensive. I have got them still -- the watch goes beautifully.

<P>You said the other day that Mrs Clements had told you everything she
knew. hi that case there is no need for me to write about the trumpery
scandal by which I was the sufferer -- the innocent sufferer, I positively
assert. You must know as well as I do what the notion was which my husband
took into his head when he found me and my fine-gentleman acquaintance
meeting each other privately and talking secrets together. But what you
don't know is how it ended between that same gentleman and myself. You
shall read and see how he behaved to me.

<P>The first words I said to him, when I saw the turn things had taken,
were, `Do me justice -- clear my character of a stain on it which you know
I don't deserve. I don't want you to make a clean breast of it to my husband
-- only tell him, on your word of honour as a gentleman, that he is wrong,
and that I am not to blame in the way he thinks I am. Do me that justice,
at least, after all I have done for you.' He flatly refused in so many
words. He told me plainly that it was his interest to let my husband and
all my neighbours believe the falsehood -- because, as long as they did
so they were quite certain never to suspect the truth. I had a spirit of
my own, and I told him they should know the truth from my lips. His reply
was short, and to the point. If I spoke, I was a lost woman, as certainly
as he was a lost man.

<P>Yes! it had come to that. He had deceived me about the risk I ran in
helping him. He had practised on my ignorance, he had tempted me with his
gifts, he had interested me with his story -- and the result of it was
that he made me his accomplice. He owned this coolly, and he ended by telling
me, for the first time, what the frightful punishment really was for his
offence, and for any one who helped him to commit it. In those days the
law was not so tender-hearted as I hear it is now. Murderers were not the
only people liable to be hanged, and women convicts were not treated like
ladies in undeserved distress. I confess he frightened me -- the mean imposter!
the cowardly blackguard! Do you understand now how I hated him? Do you
understand why I am taking all this trouble -- thankfully taking it --
to gratify the curiosity of the meritorious young gentleman who hunted
him down?

<P>Well, to go on. He was hardly fool enough to drive me to downright desperation.
I was not the sort of woman whom it was quite safe to hunt into a corner
-- he knew that, and wisely quieted me with proposals for the future.

<P>I deserved some reward (he was kind enough to say) for the service I
had done him, and some compensation (he was so obliging as to add) for
what I had suffered. He was quite willing -- generous scoundrel! -- to
make me a handsome yearly allowance, payable quarterly, on two conditions.
First, I was to hold my tongue -- in my own interests as well as in his.
Secondly, I was not to stir away from Welmingham without first letting
him know, and waiting till I had obtained his permission. In my own neighbourhood,
no virtuous female friends would tempt me into dangerous gossiping at the
tea-table. In my own neighbourhood, he would always know where to find
me. A hard condition, that second one -- but I accepted it.

<P>What else was I to do? I was left helpless, with the prospect of a coming
incumbrance in the shape of a child. What else was I to do? Cast myself
on the mercy of my runaway idiot of a husband who had raised the scandal
against me? I would have died first. Besides, the allowance was a handsome
one. I had a better income, a better house over my head, better carpets
on my floors, than half the women who turned up the whites of their eyes
at the sight of me. The dress of Virtue, in our parts, was cotton print.
I had silk.

<P>So I accepted the conditions he offered me, and made the best of them,
and fought my battle with my respectable neighbours on their own ground,
and won it in course of time -- as you saw yourself. How I kept his Secret
(and mine) through all the years that have passed from that time to this,
and whether my late daughter, Anne, ever really crept into my confidence,
and got the keeping of the Secret too -- are questions, I dare say, to
which you are curious to find an answer. Well! my gratitude refuses you
nothing. I will turn to a fresh page and give you the answer immediately.
