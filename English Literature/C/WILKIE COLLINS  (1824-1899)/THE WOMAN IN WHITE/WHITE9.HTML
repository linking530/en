A week passed, after my return to London, without the receipt of any communication
from Miss Halcombe.

<P>On the eighth day a letter in her handwriting was placed among the other
letters on my table.

<P>It announced that Sir Percival Glyde had been definitely accepted, and
that the marriage was to take place, as he had originally desired, before
the end of the year. In all probability the ceremony would be performed
during the last fortnight in December. Miss Fairlie's twenty-first birthday
was late in March. She would, therefore, by this arrangement become Sir
Percival's wife about three months before she was of age.

<P>I ought not to have been surprised, I ought not to have been sorry,
but I was surprised and sorry, nevertheless. Some little disappointment,
caused by the unsatisfactory shortness of Miss Halcombe's letter, mingled
itself with these feelings, and contributed its share towards upsetting
my serenity for the day. In six lines my correspondent announced the proposed
marriage -- in three more, she told me that Sir Percival had left Cumberland
to return to his house in Hampshire, and in two concluding sentences she
informed me, first, that Laura was sadly in want of change and cheerful
society; secondly, that she had resolved to try the effect of some such
change forthwith, by taking her sister away with her on a visit to certain
old friends in Yorkshire. There the letter ended, without a word to explain
what the circumstances were which had decided Miss Fairlie to accept Sir
Percival Glyde in one short week from the time when I had last seen her.

<P>At a later period the cause of this sudden determination was fully explained
to me. It is not my business to relate it imperfectly, on hearsay evidence.
The circumstances came within the personal experience of Miss Halcombe,
and when her narrative succeeds mine, she will describe them in every particular
exactly as they happened. In the meantime, the plain duty for me to perform
-- before I, in my turn, lay down my pen and withdraw from the story --
is to relate the one remaining event connected with Miss Fairlie's proposed
marriage in which I was concerned, namely, the drawing of the settlement.

<P>It is impossible to refer intelligibly to this document without first
entering into certain particulars in relation to the bride's pecuniary
affairs. I will try to make my explanation briefly and plainly, and to
keep it free from professional obscurities and technicalities. The matter
is of the utmost importance. I warn all readers of these lines that Miss
Fairlie's inheritance is a very serious part of Miss Fairlie's story, and
that Mr Gilmore's experience, in this particular, must be their experience
also, if they wish to understand the narratives which are yet to come.

<P>Miss Fairlie's expectations, then, were of a twofold kind, comprising
her possible inheritance of real property, or land, when her uncle died,
and her absolute inheritance of personal property, or money, when she came
of age.

<P>Let us take the land first.

<P>In the time of Miss Fairlie's paternal grandfather (whom we will call
Mr Fairlie, the elder) the entailed succession to the Limmeridge estate
stood thus --

<P>Mr Fairlie, the elder, died and left three sons, Philip, Frederick,
and Arthur. As eldest son, Philip succeeded to the estate. If he died without
leaving a son, the property went to the second brother, Frederick; and
if Frederick died also without leaving a son, the property went to the
third brother, Arthur.

<P>As events turned out, Mr Philip Fairlie died leaving an only daughter,
the Laura of this story, and the estate, in consequence, went, in course
of law, to the second brother, frederick, a single man. The third brother,
Arthur, had died many years before the decease of Philip, leaving a son
and a daughter. The son, at the age of eighteen, was drowned at Oxford.
His death left Laura, the daughter of Mr Philip Fairlie, presumptive heiress
to the estate, with every chance of succeeding to it, in the ordinary course
of nature, on her uncle Frederick's death, if the said Frederick died without
leaving male issue.

<P>Except in the event, then, of Mr Frederick Fairlie's marrying and leaving
an heir (the two very last things in the world that he was likely to do),
his niece, Laura, would have the property on his death, possessing, it
must be remembered, nothing more than a life-interest in it. If she died
single, or died childless, the estate would revert to her cousin, Magdalen,
the daughter of Mr Arthur Fairlie. If she married, with a proper settlement
-- or, in other words, with the settlement I meant to make for her -- the
income from the estate (a good three thousand a year) would, during her
lifetime, be at her own disposal. If she died before her husband, he would
naturally expect to be left in the enjoyment of the income, for his lifetime.
If she had a son, that son would be the heir, to the exclusion of her cousin
Magdalen. Thus, Sir Percival's prospects in marrying Miss Fairlie (so far
as his wife's expectations from real property were concerned) promised
him these two advantages, on Mr Frederick Fairlie's death: First, the use
of three thousand a year (by his wife's permission, while she lived, and
in his own right, on her death, if he survived her); and, secondly, the
inheritance of Limmeridge for his son, if he had one.

<P>So much for the landed property, and for the disposal of the income
from it, on the occasion of Miss Fairlie's marriage. Thus far, no difficulty
or difference of opinion on the lady's settlement was at all likely to
arise between Sir Percival's lawyer and myself.

<P>The personal estate, or, in other words, the money to which Miss Fairlie
would become entitled on reaching the age of twenty-one years, is the next
point to consider.

<P>This part of her inheritance was, in itself, a comfortable little fortune.
It was derived under her father's will, and it amounted to the sum of twenty
thousand pounds. Besides this, she had a life-interest in ten thousand
pounds more, which latter amount was to go, on her decease, to her aunt
Eleanor, her father's only sister. It will greatly assist in setting the
family affairs before the reader in the clearest possible light, if I stop
here for a moment, to explain why the aunt had been kept waiting for her
legacy until the death of the niece.

<P>Mr Philip Fairlie had lived on excellent terms with his sister Eleanor,
as long as she remained a single woman. But when her marriage took place,
somewhat late in life, and when that marriage united her to an Italian
gentleman named Fosco, or, rather, to an Italian nobleman -- seeing that
he rejoiced in the title of Count -- Mr Fairlie disapproved of her conduct
so strongly that he ceased to hold any communication with her, and even
went the length of striking her name out of his will. The other members
of the family all thought this serious manifestation of resentment at his
sister's marriage more or less unreasonable. Count Fosco, though not a
rich man, was not a penniless adventurer either. He had a small but sufficient
income of his own. He had lived many years in England, and he held an excellent
position in society. These recommendations, however, availed nothing with
Mr Fairlie. In many of his opinions he was an Englishman of the old school,
and he hated a foreigner simply and solely because he was a foreigner.
The utmost that he could be prevailed on to do, in after years -- mainly
at Miss Fairlie's intercession -- was to restore his sister's name to its
former place in his will, but to keep her waiting for her legacy by giving
the income of the money to his daughter for life, and the money itself,
if her aunt died before her, to her cousin Magdalen. Considering the relative
ages of the two ladies, the aunt's chance, in the ordinary course of nature,
of receiving the ten thousand pounds, was thus rendered doubtful in the
extreme; and Madame Fosco resented her brother's treatment of her as unjustly
as usual in such cases, by refusing to see her niece, and declining to
believe that Miss Fairlie's intercession had ever been exerted to restore
her name to Mr Fairlie's will.

<P>Such was the history of the ten thousand pounds. Here again no difficulty
could arise with Sir Percival's legal adviser. The income would be at the
wife's disposal, and the principal would go to her aunt or her cousin on
her death.

<P>All preliminary explanations being now cleared out of the way, I come
at last to the real knot of the case -- to the twenty thousand pounds.

<P>This sum was absolutely Miss Fairlie's own on her completing her twenty-first
year, and the whole future disposition of it depended, in the first instance,
on the conditions I could obtain for her in her marriage-settlement. The
other clauses contained in that document were of a formal kind, and need
not be recited here. But the clause relating to the money is too important
to be passed over. A few lines will be sufficient to give the necessary
abstract of it.

<P>My stipulation in regard to the twenty thousand pounds was simply this:
The whole amount was to be settled so as to give the income to the lady
for her life -- afterwards to Sir Percival for his life -- and the principal
to the children of the marriage. In default of issue, the principal was
to be disposed of as the lady might by her will direct, for which purpose
I reserved to her the right of making a will. The effect of these conditions
may be thus summed up. If Lady Glyde died without leaving children, her
half-sister Miss Halcombe, and any other relatives or friends whom she
might be anxious to benefit, would, on her husband's death, divide among
them such shares of her money as she desired them to have. If, on the other
hand, she died leaving children, then their interest, naturally and necessarily,
superseded all other interests whatsoever. This was the clause -- and no
one who reads it can fail, I think, to agree with me that it meted out
equal justice to all parties.

<P>We shall see how my proposals were met on the husband's side.

<P>At the time when Miss Halcombe's letter reached me I was even more busily
occupied than usual. But I contrived to make leisure for the settlement.
I had drawn it, and had sent it for approval to Sir Percival's solicitor,
in less than a week from the time when Miss Halcombe had informed me of
the proposed marriage.

<P>After a lapse of two days the document was returned to me, with notes
and remarks of the baronet's lawyer. His objections, in general, proved
to be of the most trifling and technical kind, until he came to the clause
relating to the twenty thousand pounds. Against this there were double
lines drawn in red ink, and the following note was appended to them --

<P>`Not admissible. The <I>principal</I> to go to Sir Percival Glyde, in
the event of his surviving Lady Glyde, and there being no issue.'

<P>That is to say, not one farthing of the twenty thousand pounds was to
go to Miss Halcombe, or to any other relative or friend of Lady Glyde's.
The whole sum, if she left no children, was to slip into the pockets of
her husband.

<P>The answer I wrote to this audacious proposal was as short and sharp
as I could make it. `My dear sir. Miss Fairlie's settlement. I maintain
the clause to which you object, exactly as it stands. Yours truly.' The
rejoinder came back in a quarter of an hour. `My dear sir. Miss Fairlie's
settlement. I maintain the red ink to which you object, exactly as it stands.
Yours truly.' In the detestable slang of the day, we were now both `at
a deadlock, and nothing was left for it but to refer to our clients on
either side.

<P>As matters stood, my client -- Miss Fairlie not having yet completed
her twenty-first year -- Mr Frederick Fairlie, was her guardian. I wrote
by that day's post, and put the case before him exactly as it stood, not
only urging every argument I could think of to induce him to maintain the
clause as I had drawn it, but stating to him plainly the mercenary motive
which was at the bottom of the opposition to my settlement of the twenty
thousand pounds. The knowledge of Sir Percival's affairs which I had necessarily
gained when the provisions of the deed on <I>his</I> side were submitted
in due course to my examination, had but too plainly informed me that the
debts on his estate were enormous, and that his income, though nominally
a large one, was virtually, for a man in his position, next to nothing.
The want of ready money was the practical necessity of Sir Percival's existence,
and his lawyer's note on the clause in the settlement was nothing but the
frankly selfish expression of it.

<P>Mr Fairlie's answer reached me by return of post, and proved to be wandering
and irrelevant in the extreme. Turned into plain English, it practically
expressed itself to this effect: `Would dear Gilmore be so very obliging
as not to worry his friend and client about such a trifle as a remote contingency?
Was it likely that a young woman of twenty-one would die before a man of
forty-five, and die without children? On the other hand, in such a miserable
world as this, was it possible to over-estimate the value of peace and
quietness? If those two heavenly blessings were offered in exchange for
such an earthly trifle as a remote chance of twenty thousand pounds, was
it not a fair bargain? Surely, yes. Then why not make it?'

<P>I threw the letter away in disgust. Just as it had fluttered to the
ground, there was a knock at my door, and Sir Percival's solicitor, Mr
Merriman, was shown in. There are many varieties of sharp practitioners
in this world, but I think the hardest of all to deal with are the men
who overreach you under the disguise of inveterate good-humour. A fat,
well-fed, smiling, friendly man of business is of all parties to a bargain
the most hopeless to deal with. Mr Merriman was one of this class.

<P>`And how is good Mr Gilmore?' he began, all in a glow with the warmth
of his own amiability. `Glad to see you, sir, in such excellent health.
I was passing your door, and I thought I would look in in case you might
have something to say to me. Do -- now pray do let us settle this little
difference of ours by word of mouth, if we can! Have you heard from your
client yet?'

<P>`Yes. Have you heard from yours?'

<P>`My dear, good sir! I wish I had heard from him to any purpose -- I
wish, with all my heart, the responsibility was off my shoulders; but he
is obstinate -- or let me rather say, resolute -- and he won't take it
off. ``Merriman, I leave details to you. Do what you think right for my
interests, and consider me as having personally withdrawn from the business
until it is all over.'' Those were Sir Percival's words a fortnight ago,
and all I can get him to do now is to repeat them. I am not a hard man,
Mr Gilmore, as you know. Personally and privately, I do assure you, I should
like to sponge out that note of mine at this very moment. But if Sir Percival
won't go into the matter, if Sir Percival will blindly Leave all his interests
in my sole care, what course can I possibly take except the course of asserting
them? My hands are bound -- don't you see, my dear sir? -- my hands are
bound.'

<P>`You maintain your note on the clause, then, to the letter?' I said.

<P>`Yes -- deuce take it! I have no other alternative.' He walked to the
fireplace and warmed himself, humming the fag end of a tune in a rich convivial
bass voice. `What does your side say?' he went on; `now pray tell me --
what does your side say?'

<P>I was ashamed to tell him. I attempted to gain time -- nay, I did worse.
My legal instincts got the better of me, and I even tried to bargain.

<P>`Twenty thousand pounds is rather a large sum to be given up by the
lady's friends at two days' notice,' I said.

<P>`Very true,' replied Mr Merriman, looking down thoughtfully at his boots.
`Properly put, sir -- most properly put!'

<P>`A compromise, recognising the interests of the lady's family as well
as the interests of the husband, might not perhaps have frightened my client
quite so much,' I went on. `Come, come! this contingency resolves itself
into a matter of bargaining after all. What is the least you will take?'

<P>`The least we will take,' said Mr Merriman, `is nineteen-thousand --
nine -- hundred -- and -- ninety -- nine -- pounds -- nineteen-shillings-and-eleven-pence-three-farthings.
Ha! ha I ha! Excuse me, Mr Gilmore. I must have my little joke.'

<P>`Little enough,' I remarked. `The joke is just worth the odd farthing
it was made for.'

<P>Mr Merriman was delighted. He laughed over my retort till the room rang
again. I was not half so good-humoured on my side; I came back to business,
and closed the interview.

<P>`This is Friday,' I said. `Give us till Tuesday next for our final answer.'

<P>`By all means,' replied Mr Merriman. `Longer, my dear sir, if you like.'
He took up his hat to go, and then addressed me again. `By the way,' he
said, `your clients in Cumberland have not heard anything more of the woman
who wrote the anonymous letter, have they?'

<P>`Nothing more,' I answered. `Have you found no trace of her?'

<P>`Not yet,' said my legal friend. `But we don't despair. Sir Percival
has his suspicions that Somebody is keeping her in hiding, and we are having
that Somebody watched.'

<P>`You mean the old woman who was with her in Cumberland,' I said.

<P>`Quite another party, sir,' answered Mr Merriman. `We don't happen to
have laid hands on the old woman yet. Our Somebody is a man. We have got
him close under our eye here in London, and we strongly suspect he had
something to do with helping her in the first instance to escape from the
Asylum. Sir Percival wanted to question him at once, but I said, ``No.
Questioning him will only put him on his guard -- watch him, and wait.''
We shall see what happens. A dangerous woman to be at large, Mr Gilmore;
nobody knows what she may do next. I wish you good morning, sir. On Tuesday
next I shall hope for the pleasure of hearing from you.' He smiled amiably
and went out.

<P>My mind had been rather absent during the latter part of the conversation
with my legal friend. I was so anxious about the matter of the settlement
that I had little attention to give to any other subject, and the moment
I was left alone again I began to think over what my next proceeding ought
to be.

<P>In the case of any other client I should have acted on my instructions,
however personally distasteful to me, and have given up the point about
the twenty thousand pounds on the spot. But I could not act with this business-like
indifference towards Miss Fairlie. I had an honest feeling of affection
and admiration for her -- I remembered gratefully that her father had been
the kindest patron and friend to me that ever man had -- I had felt towards
her while I was drawing the settlement as I might have felt, if I had not
been an old bachelor, towards a daughter of my own, and I was determined
to spare no personal sacrifice in her service and where her interests were
concerned. Writing a second time to Mr Fairlie was not to be thought of
-- it would only be giving him a second opportunity of slipping through
my fingers. Seeing him and personally remonstrating with him might possibly
be of more use. The next day was Saturday. I determined to take a return
ticket and jolt my old bones down to Cumberland, on the chance of persuading
him to adopt the just, the independent, and the honourable course. It was
a poor chance enough, no doubt, but when I had tried it my conscience would
be at ease. I should then have done all that a man in my position could
do to serve the interests of my old friend's only child.

<P>The weather on Saturday was beautiful, a west wind and a bright sun.
Having felt latterly a return of that fulness and oppression of the head,
against which my doctor warned me so seriously more than two years since,
I resolved to take the opportunity of getting a little extra exercise by
sending my bag on before me and walking to the terminus in Euston Square.
As I came out into Holborn a gentleman walking by rapidly stopped and spoke
to me. It was Mr Walter Hartright.

<P>If he had not been the first to greet me I should certainly have passed
him. He was so changed that I hardly knew him again. His face looked pale
and haggard -- his manner was hurried and uncertain -- and his dress, which
I remembered as neat and gentleman-like when I saw him at Limmeridge, was
so slovenly now that I should really have been ashamed of the appearance
of it on one of my own clerks.

<P>`Have you been long back from Cumberland?' he asked. `I heard from Miss
Halcombe lately. I am aware that Sir Percival Glyde's explanation has been
considered satisfactory. Will the marriage take place soon? Do you happen
to know, Mr Gilmore?'

<P>He spoke so fast, and crowded his questions together so strangely and
confusedly, that I could hardly follow him. However accidentally intimate
he might have been with the family at Limmeridge, I could not see that
he had any right to expect information on their private affairs, and I
determined to droP him, as easily as might be, on the subject of Miss Fairlie's
marriage.

<P>`Time will show, Mr Hartright,' I said -- `time will show. I dare say
if we look out for the marriage in the papers we shall not be far wrong.
Excuse my noticing it, but I am sorry to see you not looking so well as
you were when we last met.'

<P>A momentary nervous contraction quivered about his lips and eyes, and
made me half reproach myself for having answered him in such a significantly
guarded manner.

<P>`I had no right to ask about her marriage,' he said bitterly. `I must
wait to see it in the newspapers like other people. Yes,' -- he went on
before I could make any apologies -- `I have not been well lately. I am
going to another country to try a change of scene and occupation. Miss
Halcombe has kindly assisted me with her influence, and my testimonials
have been found satisfactory. It is a long distance off, but I don't care
where I go, what the climate is, or how long I am away.' He looked about
him while he said this at the throng of strangers passing us by on either
side, in a strange, suspicious manner, as if he thought that some of them
might be watching us.

<P>`I wish you well through it, and safe back again,' I said, and then
added, so as not to keep him altogether at arm's length on the subject
of the Fairlies, `I am going down to Limmeridge today on business- Miss
Halcombe and Miss Fairlie are away just now on a visit to some friends
in Yorkshire.'

<P>His eyes brightened, and he seemed about to say something in answer,
but the same momentary nervous spasm crossed his face again. He took my
hand, pressed it hard, and disappeared among the crowd without saying another
word. Though he was little more than a stranger to me, I waited for a moment,
looking after him almost with a feeling of regret. I had gained in my profession
sufficient experience of young men to know what the outward signs and tokens
were of their beginning to go wrong, and when I resumed my walk to the
railway I am sorry to say I felt more than doubtful about Mr Hartright's
future.

IV</H2></CENTER>
Leaving by an early train, I got to Limmeridge in time for dinner. The
house was oppressively empty and dull. I had expected that good Mrs Vesey
would have been company for me in the absence of the young ladies, but
she was confined to her room by a cold. The servants were so surprised
at seeing me that they hurried and bustled absurdly, and made all sorts
of annoying mistakes. Even the butler, who was old enough to have known
better, brought me a bottle of port that was chilled. The reports of Mr
Fairlie's health were just as usual, and when I sent up a message to announce
my arrival, I was told that he would be delighted to see me the next morning,
but that the sudden news of my appearance had prostrated him with palpitations
for the rest of the evening. The wind howled dismally all night, and strange
cracking and groaning noises sounded here, there, and everywhere in the
empty house. I slept as wretchedly as possible, and got up in a mighty
bad humour to breakfast by myself the next morning.

<P>At ten o'clock I was conducted to Mr Fairlie's apartments. He was in
his usual room, his usual chair, and his usual aggravating state of mind
and body. When I went in, his valet was standing before him, holding up
for inspection a heavy volume of etchings, as long and as broad as my office
writing-desk. The miserable foreigner grinned in the most abject manner,
and looked ready to drop with fatigue, while his master composedly turned
over the etchings, and brought their hidden beauties to light with the
help of a magnifying glass.

<P>`You very best of good old friends,' said Mr Fairlie, leaning back lazily
before he could look at me, `are you quite well? How nice of you to come
here and see me in my solitude. Dear Gilmore!'

<P>I had expected that the valet would be dismissed when I appeared, but
nothing of the sort happened. There he stood, in front of his master's
chair, trembling under the weight of the etchings, and there Mr Fairlie
sat, serenely twirling the magnifying glass between his white fingers and
thumbs.

<P>`I have come to speak to you on a very important matter,' I said, `and
you will therefore excuse me, if I suggest that we had better be alone.'

<P>The unfortunate valet looked at me gratefully. Mr Fairlie faintly repeated
my last three words, `better be alone,' with every appearance of the utmost
possible astonishment.

<P>I was in no humour for trifling, and I resolved to make him understand
what I meant.

<P>`Oblige me by giving that man permission to withdraw,' I said, pointing
to the valet.

<P>Mr Fairlie arched his eyebrows and pursed up his lips in sarcastic surprise.

<P>`Man?' he repeated. `You provoking old Gilmore, what can you possibly
mean by calling him a man? He's nothing of the sort. He might have been
a man half an hour ago, before I wanted my etchings, and he may be a man
half an hour hence, when I don't want them any longer. At present he is
simply a portfolio stand. Why object, Gilmore, to a portofolio stand?'

<P>`I <I>do</I> object For the third time, Mr Fairlie, I beg that we may
be alone.'

<P>My tone and manner left him no alternative but to comply with my request.
He looked at the servant, and pointed peevishly to a chair at his side.

<P>`Put down the etchings and go away,' he said. `Don't upset me by losing
my place. Have you, or have you not, lost my place? Are you sure you have
<I>not</I>? And have you put my handbell quite within my reach? Yes? Then
why the devil don't you go?'

<P>The valet went out. Mr Fairlie twisted himself round in his chair, polished
the magnifying glass with his delicate cambric handkerchief, and indulged
himself with a sidelong inspection of the open volume of etchings. It was
not easy to keep my temper under these circumstances, but I did keep it.

<P>`I have come here at great personal inconvenience,' I said, `to serve
the interests of your niece and your family, and I think I have established
some slight claim to be favoured with your attention in return.'

<P>`Don't bully me!' exclaimed Mr Fairlie, falling back helplessly in the
chair, and closing his eyes. `Please don't bully me. I'm not strong enough.'

<P>I was determined not to let him provoke me, for Laura Fairlie's sake.

<P>`My object,' I went on, `is to entreat you to reconsider your letter,
and not to force me to abandon the just rights of your niece, and of all
who belong to her. Let me state the case to you once more, and for the
last time.'

<P>Mr Fairlie shook his head and sighed piteously.

<P>`This is heartless of you, Gilmore -- very heartless,' he said. `Never
mind, go on.'

<P>I put all the points to him carefully -- I set the matter before him
in every conceivable light. He lay back in the chair the whole time I was
speaking with his eyes closed. When I had done he opened them indolently,
took his silver smelling-bottle from the table, and sniffed at it with
an air of gentle relish.

<P>`Good Gilmore I' he said between the sniffs, `how very nice this is
of you I How you reconcile one to human nature!'

<P>`Give me a plain answer to a plain question, Mr Fairlie. I tell you
again, Sir Percival Glyde has no shadow of a claim to expect more than
the income of the money. The money itself, if your niece has no children,
ought to be under her control, and to return to her family. If you stand
firm, Sir Percival must give way -- he must give way, I tell you, or he
exposes himself to the base imputation of marrying Miss Fairlie entirely
from mercenary motives.'

<P>Mr Fairlie shook the silver smelling-bottle at me playfully.

<P>`You dear old Gilmore, how you do hate rank and family, don't you? How
you detest Glyde because he happens to be a baronet. What a Radical you
are -- oh, dear me, what a Radical you are!'

<P>A Radical!!! I could put up with a good deal of provocation, but, after
holding the soundest Conservative principles all my life, I could <I>not</I>
put up with being called a Radical. My blood boiled at it -- I started
out of my chair -- I was speechless with indignation.

<P>`Don't shake the room!' cried Mr Fairlie -- `for Heaven's sake don't
shake the room I Worthiest of all possible Gilmores, I meant no offence.
My own views are so extremely liberal that I think I am a Radical myself.
Yes. We are a pair of Radicals. Please don't be angry. I can't quarrel
-- I haven't stamina enough. Shall we drop the subject? Yes. Come and look
at these sweet etchings. Do let me teach you to understand the heavenly
pearliness of these lines. Do now, there's a good Gilmore!'

<P>While he was maundering on in this way I was, fortunately for my own
self-respect, returning to my senses. When I spoke again I was composed
enough to treat his impertinence with the silent contempt that it deserved.

<P>`You are entirely wrong, sir,' I said, `in supposing that I speak from
any prejudice against Sir Percival Glyde. I may regret that he has so unreservedly
resigned himself in this matter to his lawyer's direction as to make any
appeal to himself impossible, but I am not prejudiced against him. What
I have said would equally apply to any other man in his situation, high
or low. The principle I maintain is a recognised principle. If you were
to apply to the nearest town here, to the first respectable solicitor you
could find, he would tell you as a stranger what I tell you as a friend.
He would inform you that it is against all rule to abandon the lady's money
entirely to the man she marries. He would decline, on grounds of common
legal caution, to give the husband, under any circumstances whatever, an
interest of twenty thousand pounds in his wife's death.'

<P>`Would he really, Gilmore?' said Mr Fairlie. `If he said anything half
so horrid, I do assure you I should tinkle my bell for Louis, and have
him sent out of the house immediately.'

<P>`You shall not irritate me, Mr Fairlie -- for your niece's sake and
for her father's sake, you shall not irritate me. You shall take the whole
responsibility of this discreditable settlement on your own shoulders before
I leave the room.'

<P>`Don't! -- now please don't!' said Mr Fairlie. `Think how precious your
time is, Gilmore, and don't throw it away. I would dispute with you if
I could, but I can't -- I haven't stamina enough. You want to upset me,
to upset yourself, to upset Glyde, and to upset Laura; and -- oh, dear
me! -- all for the sake of the very last thing in the world that is likely
to happen. No, dear friend, in the interests of peace and quietness, positively
No!'

<P>`I am to understand, then, that you hold by the determination expressed
in your letter?'

<P>`Yes, please. So glad we understand each other at last. Sit down again
-- do!'

<P>I walked at once to the door, and Mr Fairlie resignedly `tinkled' his
hand-bell. Before I left the room I turned round and addressed him for
the last time.

<P>`Whatever happens in the future, sir,' I said, `remember that my plain
duty of warning you has been performed. As the faithful friend and servant
of your family, I tell you, at parting, that no daughter of mine should
be married to any man alive under such a settlement as you are forcing
me to make for Miss Fairlie.'

<P>The door opened behind me, and the valet stood waiting on the threshold.

<P>`Louis,' said Mr Fairlie, `show Mr Gilmore out, and then come back and
hold up my etchings for me again. Make them give you a good lunch downstairs.
Do, Gilmore, make my idle beasts of servants give you a good lunch!'

<P>I was too much disgusted to reply -- I turned on my heel, and left him
in silence. There was an up train at two o'clock in the afternoon, and
by that train I returned to London.

<P>On the Tuesday I sent in the altered settlement, which practically disinherited
the very persons whom Miss Fairlie's own lips had informed me she was most
anxious to benefit. I had no choice. Another lawyer would have drawn up
the deed if I had refused to undertake it.

<P>My task is done. My personal share in the events of the family story
extends no farther than the point which I have just reached. Other pens
than mine will describe the strange circumstances which are now shortly
to follow. Seriously and sorrowfully I close this brief record. Seriously
and sorrowfully I repeat here the parting words that I spoke at Limmeridge
House: -- No daughter of mine should have been married to any man alive
under such a settlement as I was compelled to make for Laura Fairlie.
