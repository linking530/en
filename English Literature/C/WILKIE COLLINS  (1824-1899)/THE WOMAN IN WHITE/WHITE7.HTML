Half an hour later I was back at the house, and was informing Miss Halcombe
of all that had happened.

<P>She listened to me from beginning to end with a steady, silent attention,
which, in a woman of her temperament and disposition, was the strongest
proof that could be offered of the serious manner in which my narrative
affected her.

<P>`My mind misgives me,' was all she said when I had done. `My mind misgives
me sadly about the future.'

<P>`The future may depend,' I suggested, `on the use we make of the present.
It is not improbable that Anne Catherick may speak more readily and unreservedly
to a woman than she has spoken to me. If Miss Fairlie.'

<P>`Not to be thought of for a moment,' interposed Miss Halcombe, in her
most decided manner.

<P>`Let me suggest, then,' I continued, `that you should see Anne Catherick
yourself, and do all you can to win her confidence. For my own part, I
shrink from the idea of alarming the poor creature a second time, as I
have most unhappily alarmed her already. Do you see any objection to accompanying
me to the farmhouse tomorrow?'

<P>`None whatever. I will go anywhere and do anything to serve Laura's
interests. What did you say the place was called?'

<P>`You must know it well. It is called Todd's Corner.'

<P>`Certainly. Todd's Corner is one of Mr Fairlie's farms. Our dairymaid
here is the farmer's second daughter. She goes backwards and forwards constantly
between this house and her father's farm, and she may have heard or seen
something which it may be useful to us to know. Shall I ascertain, at once,
if the girl is downstairs?'

<P>She rang the bell, and sent the servant with his message. He returned,
and announced that the dairymaid was then at the farm. She had not been
there for the last three days, and the housekeeper had given her leave
to go home for an hour or two that evening.

<P>`I can speak to her tomorrow,' said Miss Halcombe, when the servant
had left the room again. `In the meantime, let me thoroughly understand
the object to be gained by my interview with Anne Catherick. Is there no
doubt in your mind that the person who confined her in the Asylum was Sir
Percival Glyde?'

<P>`There is not the shadow of a doubt. The only mystery that remains is
the mystery of his motive. Looking to the great difference between his
station in life and hers, which seems to preclude all idea of the most
distant relationship between them, it is of the last importance -- even
assuming that she really required to be placed under restraint -- to know
why <I>he</I> should have been the person to assume the serious responsibility
of shutting her up --'

<P>`In a private Asylum, I think you said?'

<P>`Yes, in a private Asylum, where a sun of money, which no poor person
could afford to give, must have been paid for her maintenance as a patient.'

<P>`I see where the doubt lies, Mr Hartright, and I promise you that it
shall be set at rest, whether Anne Catherick assists us tomorrow or not.
Sir Percival Glyde shall not be long in this house without satisfying Mr
Gilmore, and satisfying me. My sister's future is my dearest care in life,
and I have influence enough over her to give me some power, where her marriage
is concerned, in the disposal of it.'

<P>We parted for the night.

<P>After breakfast the next morning, an obstacle, which the events of the
evening before had put out of my memory, interposed to prevent our proceeding
immediately to the farm. This was my last day at Limmeridge House, and
it was necessary, as soon as the post came in, to follow Miss Halcombe's
advice, and to ask Mr Fairlie's permission to shorten my engagement by
a month, in consideration of an unforeseen necessity for my return to London.

<P>Fortunately for the probability of this excuse, so far as appearances
were concerned, the post brought me two letters from London friends that
morning. I took them away at once to my own room, and sent the servant
with a message to Mr Fairlie, requesting to know when I could see him on
a matter of business.

<P>I awaited the man's return, free from the slightest feeling of anxiety
about the manner in which his master might receive my application. With
Mr Fairlie's leave or without it, I must go. The consciousness of having
now taken the first step on the dreary journey which was henceforth to
separate my life from Miss Fairlie's seemed to have blunted my sensibility
to every consideration connected with myself. I had done with my poor man's
touchy pride -- I had done with all my little artist vanities. No insolence
of Mr Fairlie's, if he chose to be insolent, could wound me now.

<P>The servant returned with a message for which I was not unprepared.
Mr Fairlie regretted that the state of his health, on that particular morning,
was such as to preclude all hope of his having the pleasure of receiving
me. He begged, therefore, that I would accept his apologies, and kindly
communicate what I had to say in the form of a letter. Similar messages
to this had reached me, at various intervals, during my three months' residence
in the house. Throughout the whole of that period Mr Fairlie had been rejoiced
to `possess' me, but had never been well enough to see me for a second
time. The servant took every fresh batch of drawings that I mounted and
restored back to his master with my `respects,' and returned empty-handed
with Mr Fairlie's `kind compliments,' `best thanks,' and `sincere regrets'
that the state of his health still obliged him to remain a solitary prisoner
in his own room. A more satisfactory arrangement to both sides could not
possibly have been adopted. It would be hard to say which of us, under
the circumstances, felt the most grateful sense of obligation to Mr Fairlie's
accommodating nerves.

<P>I sat down at once to write the letter, expressing myself in it as civilly,
as clearly, and as briefly as possible. Mr Fairlie did not hurry his reply.
Nearly an hour elapsed before the answer was placed in my hands. It was
written with beautiful regularity and neatness of character, in violet-coloured
ink, on note-paper as smooth as ivory and almost as thick as cardboard,
and it addressed me in these terms --

<P>`Mr Fairlie's compliments to Mr Hartright. Mr Fairlie is more surprised
and disappointed than he can say (in the present state of his health) by
Mr Hartright's application. Mr Fairlie is not a man of business, but he
has consulted his steward, who is, and that person confirms Mr Fairlie's
opinion that Mr Hartright's request to be allowed to break his engagement
cannot be justified by any necessity whatever, excepting perhaps a case
of life and death. If the highly-appreciative feeling towards Art and its
professors, which it is the consolation and happiness of Mr Fairlie's suffering
existence to cultivate, could be easily shaken, Mr Hartright's present
proceeding would have shaken it. It has not done so -- except in the instance
of Mr Hartright himself.

<P>`Having stated his opinion -- so far, that is to say, as acute nervous
suffering will allow him to state anything -- Mr Fairlie has nothing to
add but the expression of his decision, in reference to the highly irregular
application that has been made to him. Perfect repose of body and mind
being to the last degree important in his case, Mr Fairlie will not suffer
Mr Hartright to disturb that repose by remaining in the house under circumstances
of an essentially irritating nature to both sides. Accordingly, Mr Fairlie
waives his right of refusal, purely with a view to the preservation of
his own tranquillity -- and informs Mr Hartright that he may go.'

<P>I folded the letter up, and put it away with my other papers. The time
had been when I should have resented it as an insult -- I accepted it now
as a written release from my engagement. It was off my mind, it was almost
out of my memory, when I went downstairs to the breakfast-room, and informed
Miss Halcombe that I was ready to walk with her to the farm.

<P>`Has Mr Fairlie given you a satisfactory answer?' she asked as we left
the house.

<P>`He has allowed me to go, Miss Halcombe.'

<P>She looked up at me quickly, and then, for the first time since I had
known her, took my arm of her own accord. No words could have expressed
so delicately that she understood how the permission to leave my employment
had been granted, and that she gave me her sympathy, not as my superior,
but as my friend. I had not felt the man's insolent letter, but I felt
deeply the woman's atoning kindness.

<P>On our way to the farm we arranged that Miss Halcombe was to enter the
house alone, and that I was to wait outside, within call. We adopted this
mode of proceeding from an apprehension that my presence, after what had
happened in the churchyard the evening before, might have the effect of
renewing Anne Catherick's nervous dead, and of rendering her additionally
distrustful of the advances of a lady who was a stranger to her. Miss Halcombe
left me, with the intention of speaking, in the first instance, to the
farmer's wife (of whose friendly readiness to help her in any way she was
well assured), while I waited for her in the near neighbourhood of the
house.

<P>I had fully expected to be left alone for some time. To my surprise,
however, little more than five minutes had elapsed before Miss Halcombe
returned.

<P>`Does Anne Catherick refuse to see you?' I asked in astonishment.

<P>`Anne Catherick is gone,' replied Miss Halcombe.

<P>`Gone?'

<P>`Gone with Mrs Clements. They both left the farm at eight o'clock this
morning.'

<P>I could say nothing -- I could only feel that our last chance of discovery
had gone with them

<P>`All that Mrs Todd knows about her guests, I know,' Miss Halcombe went
on, `and it leaves me, as it leaves her, in the dark. They both came back
safe last night, after they left you, and they passed the first part-of
the evening with Mr Todd's family as usual. rust before supper-time, however,
Anne Catherick startled them all by being suddenly seized with faintness.
She had had a similar attack, of a less alarming kind, on the day she arrived
at the farm; and Mrs Todd had connected it, on that occasion, with something
she was reading at the time in our local newspaper, which lay on the farm
table, and which she had taken up only a minute or two before.'

<P>`Does Mrs Todd know what particular passage in the newspaper affected
her in that way?' I inquired.

<P>`No,' replied Miss Halcombe. `She had looked it over, and had seen nothing
in it to agitate any one. I asked leave, however, to look it over in my
turn, ad at the very first page I opened I found that the editor had enriched
his small stock of news by drawing upon our family affairs, and had published
my sister's marriage engagement, among his other announcements, copied
from the London papers, of Marriages in High Life. I concluded at once
that this was the paragraph which had so strangely affected Anne Catherick,
and I thought I saw in it, also, the origin of the letter which she sent
to our house the next day.'

<P>`There can be no doubt in either case. But what did you hear about her
second attack of faintness yesterday evening?'

<P>`Nothing. The cause of it is a complete mystery. There was no stranger
in the room. The only visitor was our dairymaid, who, as I told you, is
one of Mr Todd's daughters, and the only conversation was the usual gossip
about local affairs. They heard her cry out, and saw her turn deadly pale,
without the slightest apparent reason. Mrs Todd and Mrs Clements took her
upstairs, and Mrs Clements remained with her. They were heard talking together
until long after the usual bedtime, and early this morning Mrs Clements
took Mrs Todd aside, and amazed her beyond all power of expression by saying
that they must go. The only explanation Mrs Todd could extract from her
guest was, that something had happened, which was not the fault of any
one at the farmhouse, but which was serious enough to make Anne Catherick
resolve to leave Limmeridge immediately. It was quite useless to press
Mrs Clements to be more explicit. She only shook her head, and said that,
for Anne's sake, she must beg and pray that no one would question her.
All she could repeat, with every appearance of being seriously agitated
herself, was that Anne must go, that she must go with her, and that the
destination to which they might both betake themselves must be kept a secret
from everybody. I spare you the recital of Mrs Todd's hospitable remonstrances
and refusals. It ended in her driving them both to the nearest station,
more than three hours since. She tried hard on the way to get them to speak
more plainly, but without success; and she set them down outside the station-door,
so hurt and offended by the unceremonious abruptness of their departure
and their unfriendly reluctance to place the least confidence in her, that
she drove away in anger, without so much as stopping to bid them good-bye.
That is exactly what has taken place. Search your own memory, Mr Hartright,
and tell me if anything happened in the burial-ground yesterday evening
which can at all account for the extraordinary departure of those two women
this morning.'

<P>`I should like to account first, Miss Halcombe, for the sudden change
in Anne Catherick which alarmed them at the farmhouse, hours after she
and I had parted, and when time enough had elapsed to quiet any violent
agitation that I might have been unfortunate enough to cause. Did you inquire
particularly about the gossip which was going on in the room when she turned
faint?'

<P>`Yes. But Mrs Todd's household affairs seem to have divided her attention
that evening with the talk in the farmhouse parlour. She could only tell
me that it was ``just the news,'' -- meaning, I suppose, that they all
talked as usual about each other.'

<P>`The dairymaid's memory may be better than her mother's,' I said. `It
may be as well for you to speak to the girl, Miss Halcombe, as soon as
we get back.'

<P>My suggestion was acted on the moment we returned to the house. Miss
Halcombe led me round to the servants' offices, and we found the girl in
the dairy, with her sleeves tucked up to her shoulders, cleaning a large
milk-pan and singing blithely over her work.

<P>`I have brought this gentleman to see your dairy, Hannah,' said Miss
Halcombe. `It is one of the sights of the house, and it always does you
credit.'

<P>The girl blushed and curtseyed, and said shyly that she hoped she always
did her best to keep things neat and clean.

<P>`We have just come from your father's,' Miss Halcombe continued. `You
were there yesterday evening, I hear, and you found visitors at the house?'

<P>`Yes, miss.'

<P>`One of them was taken faint and ill, I am told? I suppose nothing was
said or done to frighten her? You were not talking of anything very terrible,
were you?'

<P>`Oh no, miss!' said the girl, laughing. `We were only talking of the
news.'

<P>`Your sisters told you the news at Todd's Corner, I suppose?'

<P>Yes, miss.

<P>`And you told them the news at Limmeridge House?'

<P>`Yes, miss. And I'm quite sure nothing was said to frighten the poor
thing, for I was talking when she was taken ill. It gave me quite a turn,
miss, to see it, never having been taken faint myself.'

<P>Before any more questions could be put to her, she was called away to
receive a basket of eggs at the dairy door. As she left us I whispered
to Miss Halcombe --

<P>`Ask her if she happened to mention, last night, that visitors were
expected at Limmeridge House.'

<P>Miss Halcombe showed me, by a look, that she understood, and put the
question as soon as the dairymaid returned to us.

<P>`Oh yes, miss, I mentioned that,' said the girl simply. `The company
coming, and the accident to the brindled cow, was all the news I had to
take to the farm.'

<P>`Did you mention names? Did you tell them that Sir Percival Glyde was
expected on Monday?'

<P>`Yes, miss -- I told them Sir Percival Glyde was coming. I hope there
was no harm in it -- I hope I didn't do wrong.'

<P>`Oh no, no harm. Come, Mr Hartright, Hannah will begin to think us in
the way, if we interrupt her any longer over her work.'

<P>We stopped and looked at one another the moment we were alone again.

<P>`Is there any doubt in your mind, now, Miss Halcombe?'

<P>`Sir Percival Glyde shall remove that doubt, Mr Hartright -- or Laura
Fairlie shall never be his wife.'

As we walked round to the front of the house a fly from the railway approached
us along the drive. Miss Halcombe waited on the door-steps until the fly
drew up, and then advanced to shake hands with an old gentleman, who got
out briskly the moment the steps were let down. Mr Gilmore had arrived.

<P>I looked at him, when we were introduced to each other, with an interest
and a curiosity which I could hardly conceal. This old man was to remain
at Limmeridge House after I had left it; he was to hear Sir Percival Glyde's
explanation, and was to give Miss Halcombe the assistance of his experience
in forming her judgment; he was to wait until the question of the marriage
was set at rest; and his hand, if that question were decided in the affirmative,
was to draw the settlement which bound Miss Fairlie irrevocably to her
engagement. Even then, when I knew nothing by comparison with what I know
now, I looked at the family lawyer with am interest which I had never felt
before in the presence of any man breathing who was a total stranger to
me.

<P>In external appearance Mr Gilmore was the exact opposite of the conventional
idea of an old lawyer. His complexion was florid -- his white hair was
worn rather long and kept carefully brushed -- his black coat, waistcoat,
and trousers fitted him with perfect neatness -- his white cravat was carefully
tied, and his lavender-coloured kid gloves might have adorned the hands
of a fashionable clergyman, without fear and without reproach. His manners
were pleasantly marked by the formal grace and refinement of the old school
of politeness, quickened by the invigorating sharpness and readiness of
a man whose business in life obliges him always to keep his faculties in
good working order. A sanguine constitution and fair prospects to begin
with -- a long subsequent career of creditable and comfortable prosperity
-- a cheerful, diligent, widely-respected old age -- such were the general
impressions I derived from my introduction to Mr Gilmore, and it is but
fair to him to add, that the knowledge I gained by later and better experience
only tended to confirm them.

<P>I left the old gentleman and Miss Halcombe to enter the house together,
and to talk of family matters undisturbed by the restraint of a stranger's
presence. They crossed the hall on their way to the drawing-room, and I
descended the steps again to wander about the garden alone.

<P>My hours were numbered at Limmeridge House -- my departure the next
morning was irrevocably settled -- my share in the investigation which
the anonymous letter had rendered necessary was at an end. No harm could
be done to any one but myself if I let my heart loose again, for the little
time that was left me, from the cold cruelty of restraint which necessity
had forced me to inflict upon it, and took my farewell of the scenes which
were associated with the brief dream-time of my happiness and my love.

<P>I turned instinctively to the walk beneath my study-window, where I
had seen her the evening before with her little dog, and followed the path
which her dear feet had trodden so often, till I came to the wicket gate
that led into her rose garden. The winter bareness spread drearily over
it now. The flowers that she had taught me to distinguish by their names,
the flowers that I had taught her to paint from, were gone, and the tiny
white paths that led between the beds were damp and green already. l went
on to the avenue of trees, where we had breathed together the warm fragrance
of August evenings, where we had admired together the myriad combinations
of shade and sunlight that dappled the ground at our feet. The leaves fell
about me from the groaning branches, and the earthy decay in the atmosphere
chilled me to the bones. A little farther on, and I was out of the grounds,
and following the lane that wound gently upward to the nearest hills. The
old felled tree by the wayside, on which we had sat to rest, was sodden
with rain, and the tuft of ferns and grasses which I had drawn for her,
nestling under the rough stone wall in front of us, had turned to a pool
of water, stagnating round an island of draggled weeds. I gained the summit
of the hill, and looked at the view which we had so often admired in the
happier time. It was cold and barren -- it was no longer the view that
I remembered. The sunshine of her presence was far from me -- the charm
of her voice no longer murmured in my ear. She had talked to me, on the
spot from which I now looked down, of her father, who was her last surviving
parent -- had told mc how fond of each other they had been, and how sadly
she missed him still when she entered certain rooms in the house, and when
she took up forgotten occupations and amusements with which he had been
associated. Was the view that I had seen, while listening to those words,
the view that I saw now, standing on the hill-top by myself? I turned and
left it -- I wound my way back again, over the moor, and round the sandhills,
down to the beach. There was the white rage of the surf, and the multitudinous
glory of the leaping waves -- but where was the place on which she had
once drawn idle figures with her parasol in the sand -- the place where
we had sat together, while she talked to me about myself and my home, while
she asked me a woman's minutely observant questions about my mother and
my sister, and innocently wondered whether I should ever leave my lonely
chambers and have a wife and a house of my own? Wind and wave had long
since smoothed out the trace of her which she had left in those marks on
the sand. I looked over the wide monotony of the seaside prospect, and
the place in which we two had idled away the sunny hours was as lost to
me as if I had never known it, as strange to me as if I stood already on
a foreign shore.

<P>The empty silence of the beach struck cold to my heart. I returned to
the house and the garden, where traces were left to speak of her at every
turn.

<P>On the west terrace walk I met Mr Gilmore. He was evidently in search
of me, for he quickened his pace when we caught sight of each other. The
state of my spirits little fitted me for the society of a stranger; but
the meeting was inevitable, and I resigned myself to make the best of it.

<P>`You are the very person I wanted to see,' said the old gentleman. `I
had two words to say to you, my dear sir; and if you have no objection
I will avail myself of the present opportunity. To put it plainly, Miss
Halcombe and I have been talking over family affairs -- affairs which are
the cause of my being here -- and in the course of our conversation she
was naturally led to tell me of this unpleasant matter connected with the
anonymous letter, and of the share which you have most creditably and properly
taken in the proceedings so far. That share, I quite understand, gives
you an interest which you might not otherwise have felt, in knowing that
the future management of the investigation which you have begun will be
placed in safe hands. My dear sir, make yourself quite easy on that point
-- it will be placed in my hands.'

<P>`You are, in every way, Mr Gilmore, much fitter to advise and to act
in the matter than I am. Is it an indiscretion on my part to ask if you
have decided yet on a course of proceeding?'

<P>`So far as it is possible to decide, Mr Hartright, I have decided. I
mean to send a copy of the letter, accompanied by a statement of the circumstances,
to Sir Percival Glyde's solicitor in London, with whom I have some acquaintance.
The letter itself I shall keep here to show to Sir Percival as soon as
he arrives. The tracing of the two women I have already provided for, by
sending one of Mr Fairlie's servants -- a confidential person -- to the
station to make inquiries. The man has his money and his directions, and
he will follow the women in the event of his finding any clue. This is
all that can be done until Sir Percival comes on Monday. I have no doubt
myself that every explanation which can be expected from a gentleman and
a man of honour, he will readily give. Sir Percival stands very high, sir
-- an eminent position, a reputation above suspicion -- I feel quite easy
about results -- quite easy, I am rejoiced to assure you. Things of this
sort happen constantly in my experience. Anonymous letters -- unfortunate
woman -- sad state of society. I don't deny that there are peculiar complications
in this case; but the case itself is, most unhappily, common -- common.'

<P>`I am afraid, Mr Gilmore, I have the misfortune to differ from you in
the view I take of the case.'

<P>`rust so, my dear sir -- just so. I am an old man, and I take the practical
view. You are a young man, and you take the romantic view. Let us not dispute
about our views. I live professionally in an atmosphere of disputation,
Mr Hartright, and I am only too glad to escape from it, as I am escaping
here. We will wait for events -- yes, yes, yes -- we will wait for events.
Charming place this. Good shooting? Probably not, none of Mr Fairlie's
land is preserved, I think. Charming place, though, and delightful people.
You draw and paint, I hear, Mr Hartright? Enviable accomplishment. What
style?'

<P>We dropped into general conversation, or rather, Mr Gilmore talked and
I listened. My attention was far from him, and from the topics on which
he discoursed so fluently. The solitary walk of the last two hours had
wrought its effect on me -- it had set the idea in my mind of hastening
my departure from Limmeridge House. Why should I prolong the hard trial
of saying farewell by one unnecessary minute? What further service was
required of me by any one? There was no useful purpose to be served by
my stay in Cumberland -- there was no restriction of time in the permission
to leave which my employer had granted to me. Why not end it there and
then?

<P>I determined to end it. There were some hours of daylight still left
-- there was no reason why my journey back to London should not begin on
that afternoon. I made the fist civil excuse that occurred to me for leaving
Mr Gilmore, and returned at once to the house.

<P>On my way up to my room I met Miss Halcombe on the stairs. She saw,
by the hurry of my movements and the change in my manner, that I had some
new purpose in view, and asked what had happened.

<P>I told her the reasons which induced me to think of hastening my departure,
exactly as I have told them here.

<P>`No, no,' she said, earnestly and kindly, `leave us like a friend --
break bread with us once more. Stay here and dine, stay here and help us
to spend our last evening with you as happily, as like our first evenings,
as we can. It is my invitation -- Mrs Vesey's invitation --' she hesitated
a little, and then added, `Laura's invitation as well.'

<P>I promised to remain. God knows I had no wish to leave even the shadow
of a sorrowful impression with any of them.

<P>My own room was the best place for me till the dinner bell rang. I waited
there till it was time to go downstairs.

<P>I had not spoken to Miss Fairlie -- I had not even seen her -- all that
day. The first meeting with her, when I entered the drawing-room, was a
hard trial to her self-control and to mine. She, too, had done her best
to make our last evening renew the golden bygone time -- the time that
could never come again. She had put on the dress which I used to admire
more than any other that she possessed -- a dark blue silk, trimmed quaintly
and prettily with old-fashioned lace; she came forward to meet me with
her former readiness -- she gave me her hand with the frank, innocent good-will
of happier days. The cold fingers that trembled round mine -- the pale
cheeks with a bright red spot burning in the midst of them -- the faint
smile that struggled to live on her lips and died away from them while
I looked at it, told me at what sacrifice of herself her outward composure
was maintained. My heart could take her no closer to me, or I should have
loved her then as I had never loved her yet.

<P>Mr Gilmore was a great assistance to us. He was in high good-humour,
and he led the conversation with unflagging spirit. Miss Halcombe seconded
him resolutely, and I did all I could to follow her example. The kind blue
eyes, whose slightest changes of expression I had learnt to interpret so
well, looked at me appealingly when we first sat down to table. Help my
sister -- the sweet anxious face seemed to say -- help my sister, and you
will help me.

<P>We got through the dinner, to all outward appearance at least, happily
enough. When the ladies had risen from table, and Mr Gilmore and I were
left alone in the dining-room, a new interest presented itself to occupy
our attention, and to give me an opportunity of quieting myself by a few
minutes of needful and welcome silence. The servant who had been despatched
to trace Anne Catherick and Mrs Clements returned with his report, and
was shown into the dining-room immediately.

<P>`Well,' said Mr Gilmore, `what have you found out?'

<P>`I have found out, sir,' answered the man, `that both the women took
tickets at our station here for Carlisle.'

<P>`You went to Carlisle, of course, when you heard that?'

<P>`l did, sir, but I am sorry to say I could find no further trace of
them.'

<P>`You inquired at the railway?'

<P>`Yes, sir.'

<P>`And at the different inns?'

<P>`Yes, sir.'

<P>`And you left the statement I wrote for you at the Police station?'

<P>`I did, sir.' .

<P>`Well, my friend, you have done all you could, and I have done all I
could, and there the matter must rest till further notice. We have played
our trump cards, Mr Hartright,' continued the old gentleman when the servant
had withdrawn. `For the present, at least, the women have outmanoeuvred
us, and our only resource now is to wait till Sir percival Glyde comes
here on Monday next. Won't you fill your glass again? Good bottle of port,
that -- sound, substantial, old wine. I have got better in my own cellar,
though.'

<P>We returned to the drawing-room -- the room in which the happiest evenings
of my life had been passed -- the room which, after this last night, I
was never to see again. Its aspect was altered since the days had shortened
and the weather had grown cold. The glass doors on the terrace side were
closed, and hidden by thick curtains. Instead of the soft twilight obscurity,
in which we used-co sit, the bright radiant glow of lamplight now dazzled
my eyes. All was changed-in-doors and out all was changed.

<P>Miss Halcombe and Mr Gilmore sat down together at the card-table --
Mrs Vesey took her customary chair. There was no restraint on the disposal
of their evening, and I felt the restraint on the disposal of mine all
the more painfully from observing it. l saw Miss Fairlie lingering near
the music-stand. The time had been when I might have joined her there.
I waited irresolutely -- I knew neither where to go nor what to do next.
She cast one quick glance at me, took a piece of music suddenly from the
stand, and came towards me of her own accord.

<P>`Shall I play some of those little melodies of Mozart's which you used
to like so much?' she asked, opening the music nervously, and looking down
at it while she spoke.

<P>Before I could thank her she hastened to the piano. The chair near it,
which I had always been accustomed to occupy, stood empty. She struck a
few chords -- then glanced round at me -- then looked back again at her
music.

<P>`Won't you take your old place?' she said, speaking very abruptly and
in very low tones.

<P>`I may take it on the last night,' I answered.

<P>She did not reply -- she kept her attention riveted on the music --
music which she knew by memory, which she had played over and over again,
in former times, without the book. I only knew that she had heard me, I
only knew that she was aware of my being close to her, by seeing the red
spot on the cheek that was nearest to me fade out, and the face grow pale
all over.

<P>`I am very sorry you are going,' she said, her voice almost sinking
to a whisper, her eyes looking more and more intently at the music, her
fingers flying over the keys of the piano with a strange feverish energy
which I had never noticed in her before.

<P>`I shall remember those kind words, Miss Fairlie, long after tomorrow
has come and gone.'

<P>The paleness grew whiter on her face, and she turned it farther away
from me.

<P>`Don't speak of tomorrow,' she said. `Let the music speak to us of tonight,
in a happier language than ours.'

<P>Her lips trembled -- a faint sigh fluttered from them, which she tried
vainly to suppress. Her fingers wavered on the piano -- she struck a false
note, confused herself in trying to set it right, and dropped her hands
angrily on her lap. Miss Halcombe and Mr Gilmore looked up in astonishment
from the card-table at which they were playing. Even Mrs Vesey, dozing
in her chair, woke at the sudden cessation of the music, and inquired what
had happened.

<P>`You play at whist, Mr Hartright?' asked Miss Halcombe, with her eyes
directed significantly at the place I occupied.

<P>I knew what she meant -- I knew she was right, and I rose at once to
go to the card-table. As I left the piano Miss Fairlie turned a page of
the music, and touched the keys again with a surer hand.

<P>`I <I>will</I> play it,' she said, striking the notes almost passionately.
`I <I>will</I> play it on the last night.'

<P>`Come, Mrs Vesey,' said Miss Halcombe, `Mr Gilmore and I are tired of
&eacute;cart&eacute; -- come and be Mr Hartright's partner at whist.'

<P>The old lawyer smiled satirically. His had been the winning hand, and
he had just turned up a king. He evidently attributed Miss Halcombe's abrupt
change in the card-table arrangements to a lady's inability to play the
losing game.

<P>The rest of the evening passed without a word or a look from her. She
kept her place at the piano, and I kept mine at the card-table. She played
unintermittingly -- played as if the music was her only refuge from herself.
Sometimes her fingers touched the notes with a lingering fondness -- a
soft, plaintive, dying tenderness, unutterably beautiful and mournful to
hear; sometimes they faltered and failed her, or hurried over the instrument
mechanically, as if their task was a burden to them. But still, change
and waver as they might in the expression they imparted to the music, their
resolution to play never faltered. She only rose from the piano when we
all rose to say Good-night.

<P>Mrs Vesey was the nearest to the door, and the first to shake hands
with me.

<P>`I shall not see you again, Mr Hartright,' said the old lady. `I am
truly sorry you are going away. You have been very kind and attentive,
and an old woman like me feels kindness and attention. I wish you happy,
sir -- I wish you a kind good-bye.'

<P>Mr Gilmore came next.

<P>`I hope we shall have a future opportunity of bettering our acquaintance,
Mr Hartright. You quite understand about that little matter of business
being safe in my hands? Yes, yes, of course. Bless me, how cold it is!
Don't let me keep you at the door. Bon voyage, my dear sir -- bon voyage,
as the French say.'

<P>I could add no more. My voice faltered, my eyes moistened in spite of
me.

<P>She caught me by both hands -- she pressed them with the strong, steady
grasp of a man -- her dark eyes glittered -- her brown complexion flushed
deep -- the force and energy of her face glowed and grew beautiful with
the pure inner light of her generosity and her pity.

<P>`I will trust you -- if ever the time comes I will trust you as my friend
and <I>her</I> friend, as <I>may</I> brother and her brother.' She stopped,
drew me nearer to her -- the fearless, noble creature -- touched my forehead,
sister-like, with her lips, and called me by my Christian name. `God bless
you, Walter!' she said. `Wait here alone and compose yourself -- I had
better not stay for both our sakes -- I had better see you go from the
balcony upstairs.'

<P>She left the room. I turned away towards the window, where nothing faced
me but the lonely autumn landscape -- I turned away to master myself, before
I too left the room in my turn, and left it for ever.

<P>A minute passed -- it could hardly have been more -- when I heard the
door open again softly, and the rustling of a woman's dress on the carpet
moved towards me. My heart beat violently as I turned round. Miss Fairlie
was approaching me from the farther end of the room.

<P>She stopped and hesitated when our eyes met, and when she saw that we
were alone. Then, with that courage which women lose so often in the small
emergency, and so seldom in the great, she came on nearer to me, strangely
pale and strangely quiet, drawing one hand after her along the table by
which she walked, and holding something at her side in the other, which
was hidden by the folds of her dress.

<P>`I only went into the drawing-room,' she said, `to look for this. It
may remind you of your visit here, and of the friends you leave behind
you. You told me I had improved very much when I did it, and I thought
you might like --'

<P>She turned her head away, and offered me a little sketch, drawn throughout
by her own pencil, of the summer-house in which we had first met. The paper
trembled in her hand as she held it out to me -- trembled in mine as I
took it from her.

<P>I was afraid to say what I felt -- I only answered, `It shall never
leave me -- all my life long it shall be the treasure that I Prize most.
I am very grateful for it -- very grateful to you, for not letting me go
away without bidding you good-bye.'

<P>`Oh!' she said innocently, `how could I let you go, after we have passed
so many happy days together!'

<P>`Those days may never return, Miss Fairlie -- my way of life and yours
are very far apart. But if a time should come, when the devotion of my
whole heart and soul and strength will give you a moment's happiness, or
spare you a moment's sorrow, will you try to remember the poor drawing-master
who has taught you? Miss Halcombe has promised to trust me -- will you
promise too?'

<P>The farewell sadness in the kind blue eyes shone dimly through her gathering
tears.

<P>`I promise it,' she said in broken tones. `Oh, don't look at me like
that! I promise it with all my heart.'

<P>I ventured a little nearer to her, and held out my hand.

<P>`You have many friends who love you, Miss Fairlie. Your happy future
is the dear object of many hopes. May I say, at parting, that it is the
dear object of my hopes too?'

<P>The tears flowed fast down her cheeks- She rested one trembling hand
on the table to steady herself while she gave me the other. I took it in
mine -- I held it fast. My head drooped over it, my tears fell on it, my
lips pressed it -- not in love; oh, not in love, at that last moment, but
in the agony and the self-abandonment of despair.

<P>`For God's sake, leave me!' she said faintly.

<P>The confession of her heart's secret burst from her in those pleading
words. I had no right to hear them, no right to answer them -- they were
the words that banished me, in the name of her sacred weakness, from the
room. It was all over. I dropped her hand, I said no more. The blinding
tears shut her out from my eyes, and I dashed them away to look at her
for the last time. One look as she sank into a chair, as her arms fell
on the table, as her fair head dropped on them wearily. One farewell look,
and the door had closed upon her -- the great gulf of separation had opened
between us -- the image of Laura Fairlie was a memory of the past already.
