June 16th. -- I have a few lines more to add to this day's entry before
I go to bed tonight.

<P>About two hours after Sir Percival rose from the luncheon-table to receive
his solicitor, Mr Merriman, in the library, I left my room alone to take
a walk in the plantations. Just as I was at the end of the landing the
library door opened and the two gentlemen came out. Thinking it best not
to disturb them by appearing on the stairs, I resolved to defer going down
till they lad crossed the hall. Although they spoke to each other in guarded
tones, their words were pronounced with sufficient distinctness of utterance
to reach my ears.

<P>`Make your mind easy, Sir Percival,' I heard the lawyer say; `it all
rests with Lady Glyde.'

<P>I had turned to go back to my own room for a minute or two, but the
sound of Laura's name on the lips of a stranger stopped me instantly. I
daresay it was very wrong and very discreditable to listen, but where is
the woman, in the whole range of our sex, who can regulate her actions
by the abstract principles of honour, when those principles point one way,
and when her affections, and the interests which grow out of them, point
the other?

<P>I listened -- and under similar circumstances I would listen again --
yes! with my ear at the keyhole, if I could not possibly manage it in any
other way.

<P>`You quite understand, Sir Percival,' the lawyer went on. `Lady Glyde
is to sign her name in the presence of a witness -- or of two witnesses,
if you wish to be particularly careful -- and is then to put her finger
on the seal and say, ``I deliver this as my act and deed.'' If that is
done in a week's time the arrangement will be perfectly successful, and
the anxiety will be all over. If not --'

<P>`What do you mean by ``if not''?' asked Sir Percival angrily. `If the
thing must be done it shall be done. I promise you that, Merriman-'

<P>`Just so, Sir Percival -- just so; but there are two alternatives in
all transactions, and we lawyers like to look both of them in the face
boldly. If through any extraordinary circumstance the arrangement should
not be made, I think I may be able to get the parties to accept bills at
three months. But how the money is to be raised when the bills fall due
--'

<P>`Damn the bills! The money is only to be got in one way, and in that
way, I tell you again, it shall be got. Take a glass of wine, Merriman,
before you go.'

<P>`Much obliged, Sir Percival, I have not a moment to lose if l am to
catch the up-train. You will let me know as soon as the arrangement is
complete? and you will not forget the caution I recommended --'

<P>`Of course I won't. There's the dog-cart at the door for you. My groom
will get you to the station in no time. Benjamin, drive like mad! Jump
in. If Mr Merriman misses the train you lose your place. Hold fast, Merriman,
and if you are upset trust to the devil to save his own.' With that parting
benediction the baronet turned about and walked back to the library.

<P>I had not heard much, but the little that had reached my ears was enough
to make me feel uneasy. The `something' that `had happened' was but too
Plainly a serious money embarrassment, and Sir Percival's relief from it
depended upon Laura. The prospect of seeing her involved in her husband's
secret difficulties filled me with dismay, exaggerated, no doubt, by my
ignorance of business and my settled distrust of Sir Percival. Instead
of going out, as I proposed, I went back immediately to Laura's room to
tell her what I had heard.

<P>She received my bad news so composedly as to surprise me. She evidently
knows more of her husband's character and her husband's embarrassments
than I have suspected up to this time.

<P>`I feared as much,' she said, `when I heard of that strange gentleman
who called, and declined to leave his name.'

<P>`Who do you think the gentleman was, then?' I asked.

<P>`Some person who has heavy claims on Sir Percival,' she answered, `and
who has been the cause of Mr Merriman's visit here today.'

<P>`Do you know anything about those claims?'

<P>`No, I know no particulars.'

<P>`You will sign nothing, Laura, without first looking at it?'

<P>`Certainly not, Marian. Whatever I can harmlessly and honestly do to
help him I will do -- for the sake of making your life and mine, love,
as easy and as happy as possible. But I will do nothing ignorantly, which
we might, one day, have reason to feel ashamed of. Let us say no more about
it now. You have got your hat on -- suppose we go and dream away the afternoon
in the grounds?'

<P>On leaving the house we directed our steps to the nearest shade.

<P>As we passed an open space among the trees in front of the house, there
was Count Fosco, slowly walking backwards and forwards on the grass, sunning
himself in the full blaze of the hot June afternoon. He had a broad straw
hat on, with a violet-coloured ribbon round it. A blue blouse, with profuse
white fancy-work over the bosom, covered his prodigious body, and was girt
about the place where his waist might once have been with a broad scarlet
leather belt. Nankeen trousers, displaying more white fancy-work over the
ankles, and purple morocco slippers, adorned his lower extremities. He
was singing Figaro's famous song in the Barber of Seville. with that crisply
fluent vocalisation which is never heard from any other than an Italian
throat, accompanying himself on the concertina, which he played with ecstatic
throwings-up of his arms, and graceful twistings and turnings of his head,
like a fat St Cecilia masquerading in male attire. `Figaro qua! Figaro
la! Figaro su! Figaro giu!' sang the Count, jauntily tossing up the concertina
at arm's length, and bowing to us, on one side of the instrument, with
the airy grace and elegance of Figaro himself at twenty vicars of age.

<P>`Take my word for it, Laura, that man knows something of Sir Percival's
embarrassments,' I said, as we returned the Count's salutation from a safe
distance.

<P>`What makes you think that?' she asked.

<P>`How should he have known, otherwise, that Mr Merriman was Sir Percival's
solicitor?' I rejoined. `Besides, when I followed you out of the luncheon-room,
he told me. without a single word of inquiry on my part, that something
had happened. Depend upon it, he knows more than we do.'

<P>`Don't ask him any questions if he does. Don't take him into our confidence.

<P>`You seem to dislike him, Laura, in a very determined manner. What has
he said or done to justify you?'

<P>`Nothing, Marian. On the contrary, he was all kindness and attention
on our journey home, and he several times checked Sir Percival's outbreaks
of temper, in the most considerate manner towards <I>me</I>. Perhaps I
dislike him because he has so much more power over my husband than I have.
Perhaps it hurts my pride to be under any obligations to his interference.
All I know is, that I do dislike him.'

<P>The rest of the day and evening passed quietly enough. The count and
I played at chess. For the first two games he politely allowed me to conquer
him, and then, when he saw that I had found him out, begged my pardon,
and at the third game checkmated me in ten minutes. Sir Percival never
once referred, all through the evening, to the lawyer's visit. But either
that event, or something else, had produced a singular alteration for the
better in him. He was as polite and agreeable to all of us, as he used
to be in the days of his probation at Limmeridge, and he was so amazingly
attentive and kind to his wife, that even icy Madame Fosco was roused into
looking at him with a grave surprise. What does this mean? I think I can
guess -- I am afraid Laura can guess -- and I am sure Count Fosco knows.
I caught Sir Percival looking at him for approval more than once in the
course of the evening.

<P>June 17th. -- A day of events. I most fervently hope I may not have
to add, a da&nbsp;<!--GH_SEARCH-->
