Chapter 23</H1></CENTER>
Is it necessary to say what my first impression was when I looked at my
visitor's card? Surely not! My sister having married a foreigner, there
was but one impression that any man in his senses could possibly feel.
Of course the Count had come to borrow money of me.

<P>`Louis,' I said, `do you think he would go away if you gave him five
shillings?'

<P>Louis looked quite shocked. He surprised me inexpressibly by declaring
that my sister's foreign husband was dressed superbly, and looked the picture
of prosperity. Under these circumstances my first impression altered to
a certain extent. I now took it for granted that the Count had matrimonial
difficulties of his own to contend with, and that he had come, like the
rest of the family, to cast them all on my shoulders.

<P>`Did he mention his business?' I asked.

<P>`Count Fosco said he had come here, sir, because Miss Halcombe was unable
to leave Blackwater Park.'

<P>Fresh troubles, apparently. Not exactly his own, as I had supposed,
but dear Marian's. Troubles, anyway. Oh dear!

<P>`Show him in,' I said resignedly.

<P>The Count's first appearance really startled me. He was such an alarmingly
large person that I quite trembled- I felt certain that he would shake
the floor and knock down my art-treasures. He did neither the one nor the
other. He was refreshingly dressed in summer costume -- his manner was
delightfully self-possessed and quiet -- he had a charming smile. My first
impression of him was highly favourable. It is not creditable to my penetration
-- as the sequel will show -- to acknowledge this, but I am a naturally
candid man, and I do acknowledge it notwithstanding.

<P>`Allow me to present myself, Mr Fairlie,' he said. `I come from Blackwater
Park, and I have the honour and the happiness of being Madame Fosco's husband.
Let me take my first and last advantage of that circumstance by entreating
you not to make a stranger of me. I beg you will not disturb yourself --
I beg you will not move.'

<P>`You are very good,' I replied. `I wish I was strong enough to get up.
Charmed to see you at Limmeridge. Please take a chair.'

<P>`I am afraid you are suffering today,' said the Count.

<P>`As usual,' I said. `I am nothing but a bundle of nerves dressed up
to look like a man.'

<P>`I have studied many subjects in my time,' remarked this sympathetic
person. `Among others the inexhaustible subject of nerves. May I make a
suggestion, at once the simplest and the most profound? Will you let me
alter the light in your room?'

<P>`Certainly -- if you will be so very kind as not to let any of it in
on me.'

<P>He walked to the window. Such a contrast to dear Marian! so extremely
considerate in all his movements!

<P>`Light,' he said, in that delightful confidential tone which is so soothing
to an invalid, `is the first essential. Light stimulates. nourishes, preserves.
You can no more do without it, Mr Fairlie, than if you were a flower. Observe.
Here, where you sit, I close the shutters to compose you. There, where
you do <I>not</I> sit, I draw up the blind and let in the invigorating
sun. Admit the light into your room if you cannot bear it on yourself.
Light, sir, is the grand decree of Providence. You accept Providence with
your own restrictions. Accept light on the same terms.'

<P>I thought this very convincing and attentive. He had taken me in up
to that point about the light, he had certainly taken me in.

<P>`You see me confused,' he said. returning to his place -- `on my word
of honour, Mr Fairlie, you see me confused in your presence.'

<P>`Shocked to hear it, I am sure. May I inquire why?'

<P>`Sir, can I enter this room (where you sit a sufferer), and see you
surrounded by these admirable objects of Art, without discovering that
you are a man whose feelings are acutely impressionable, whose sympathies
are perpetually alive? Tell me, can I do this?'

<P>If I had been strong enough to sit up in my chair I should, of course,
have bowed. Not being strong enough, I smiled my acknowledgments instead.
It did just as well, we both understood one another.

<P>`Pray follow my train of thought,' continued the Count. `I sit here,
a man of refined sympathies myself, in the presence of another man of refined
sympathies also. I am conscious of a terrible necessity for lacerating
those sympathies by referring to domestic events of a very melancholy kind.
What is the inevitable consequence? I have done myself the honour of pointing
it out to you already. I sit confused.'

<P>Was it at this point that I began to suspect he was going to bore me?
I rather think it was.

<P>`Is it absolutely necessary to refer to these unpleasant matters?' I
inquired. `In our homely English phrase, Count Fosco, won't they keep?'

<P>The Count, with the most alarming solemnity, sighed and shook his head.

<P>`Must I really hear them?'

<P>He shrugged his shoulders (it was the first foreign thing he had done
since he had been in the room), and looked at me in an unpleasantly penetrating
manner. My instincts told me that I had better close my eyes. I obeyed
my instincts.

<P>`Please break it gently,' I pleaded. `Anybody dead?'

<P>`Dead!' cried the Count, with unnecessary foreign fierceness. `Mr Fairlie,
your national composure terrifies me. In the name of Heaven, what have
I said or done to make you think me the messenger of death?'

<P>`Pray accept my apologies,' I answered. `You have said and done nothing.
I make it a rule in these distressing cases always to anticipate the worst-
It breaks the blow by meeting it half-way, and so on. Inexpressibly relieved,
I am sure, to hear that nobody is dead. Anybody ill?'

<P>I opened my eyes and looked at him. Was he very yellow when he came
in, or had he turned very yellow in the last minute or two? I really can't
say, and I can't ask Louis, because he was not in the room at the time.

<P>`Anybody ill?' I repeated, observing that my national composure still
appeared to affect him.

<P>`That is part of my bad news, Mr Fairlie. Yes. Somebody is ill.'

<P>`Grieved, I am sure. Which of them is it?'

<P>`To my profound sorrow, Miss Halcombe. Perhaps you were in some degree
prepared to hear this? Perhaps when you found that Miss Halcombe did not
come here by herself, as you proposed, and did not write a second time,
your affectionate anxiety may have made you fear that she was ill?'

<P>I have no doubt my affectionate anxiety had led to that melancholy apprehension
at some time or other, but at the moment my wretched memory entirely failed
to remind me of the circumstance. However, I said yes, in justice to myself.
I was much shocked. It was so very uncharacteristic of such a robust person
as dear Marian to be ill, that I could only suppose she had met with an
accident. A horse, or a false step on the stairs, or something of that
sort.

<P>`Is it serious?' I asked.

<P>`Serious -- beyond a doubt,' he replied. `Dangerous -- I hope and trust
not. Miss Halcombe unhappily exposed herself to be wetted through by a
heavy rain. The cold that followed was of an aggravated kind, and it has
now brought with it the worst consequences -- fever.'

<P>When I heard the word fever, and when I remembered at the same moment
that the unscrupulous person who was now addressing me had just come from
Blackwater Park, I thought I should have fainted on the spot.

<P>`Good God!' I said. `Is it infectious?'

<P>`Not at present,' he answered, with detestable composure. `It may turn
to infection -- but no such deplorable complication had taken place when
I left Blackwater Park. I have felt the deepest interest in the case, Mr
Fairlie -- I have endeavoured to assist the regular medical attendant in
watching it -- accept my personal assurances of the uninfectious nature
of the fever when I last saw it.'

<P>Accept his assurances! I never was farther from accepting anything in
my life. I would not have believed him on his oath. He was too yellow to
be believed. He looked like a walking-West-Indian-epidemic. He was big
enough to carry typhus by the ton, and to dye the very carpet he walked
on with scarlet fever. In certain emergencies my mind is remarkably soon
made up. I instantly determined to get rid of him.

<P>`You will kindly excuse an invalid,' I said -- `but long conferences
of any kind invariably upset me. May I beg to know exactly what the object
is to which I am indebted for the honour of your visit?'

<P>I fervently hoped that this remarkably broad hint would throw him off
his balance -- confuse him -- reduce him to polite apologies -- in short,
get him out of the room. On the contrary, it only settled him in his chair.
He became additionally solemn, and dignified, and confidential. He held
up two of his horrid fingers and gave me another of his unpleasantly penetrating
looks. What was I to do? I was not strong enough to quarrel with him. Conceive
my situation, if you please. Is language adequate to describe it? I think
not.

<P>`The objects of my visit,' he went on, quite irrepressibly, `are numbered
on my fingers. They are two. First, I come to bear my testimony, with profound
sorrow, to the lamentable disagreements between Sir Percival and Lady Glyde.
I am Sir Percival's oldest friend -- I am related to Lady Glyde by marriage
-- I am an eye-witness of all that has happened at Blackwater Park. In
those three capacities I speak with authority, with confidence, with honourable
regret. Sir, I inform you, as the head of lady Glyde's family, that Miss
Halcombe has exaggerated nothing in the letter which she wrote to your
address. I affirm that the remedy which that admirable lady has proposed
is the only remedy that will spare you the horrors of public scandal. A
temporary separation between husband and wife is the one peaceable solution
of this difficulty. Part them for the present, and when all causes of irritation
are removed, I, who have now the honour of addressing you -- I will undertake
to bring Sir Percival to reason. Lady Glyde is innocent, Lady Glyde is
injured, but -- follow my thought here! -- she is, on that very account
(I say it with shame), the cause of irritation while she remains under
her husband's roof. No other house can receive her with propriety but yours.
I invite you to open it.'

<P>Cool. Here was a matrimonial hailstorm pouring in the South of England,
and I was invited, by a man with fever in every fold of his coat, to come
out from the North of England and take my share of the pelting. I tried
to put the point forcibly. just as I have put it here- The Count deliberately
lowered one of his horrid fingers, kept the other up, and went on -- rode
over me, as it were, without even the common coachmanlike attention of
crying `Hi!' before he knocked me down.

<P>`Follow my thought once more, if you please,' he resumed. `My first
object you have heard. My second object in coming to this house is to do
what Miss Halcombe's illness has prevented her from doing for herself.
My large experience is consulted on all difficult matters at Blackwater
Park, and my friendly advice was requested on the interesting subject of
your letter to Miss Halcombe- I understood at once -- for my sympathies
are your sympathies -- why you wished to see her here before you pledged
yourself to inviting Lady Glyde. You are most right, sir, in hesitating
to receive the wife until you are quite certain that the husband will not
exert his authority to reclaim her. I agree to that. I also agree that
such delicate explanations as this difficulty involves are not explanations
which can be properly disposed of by writing only. My presence here (to
my own great inconvenience) is the proof that I speak sincerely. As for
the explanations themselves, I -- Fosco -- I, who know Sir Percival much
better than Miss Halcombe knows him, affirm to you, on my honour and my
word, that he will not come near this house, or attempt to communicate
with this house, while his wife is living in it. His affairs are embarrassed.
Offer him his freedom by means of the absence of Lady Glyde. I promise
you he will take his freedom, and go back to the Continent at the earliest
moment when he can get away. Is this clear to you as crystal? Yes, it is.
Have you questions to address to me? Be it so, I am here to answer- Ask,
Mr Fairlie -- oblige me by asking to your heart's content.

<P>He had said so much already in spite of me, and he looked so dreadfully
capable of saving a great deal more also in spite of me, that I declined
his amiable invitation in pure self-defence.

<P>`Many thanks. I replied. `I am sinking fast. In my state of health I
must take things for granted. Allow me to do so on this occasion. We quite
understand each other. Yes. Much obliged, I am sure, for your kind interference.
If I ever get better, and ever have a second opportunity of improving our
acquaintance --'

<P>He got up. I thought he was going. No. More talk, more time for the
development of infectious influences -- in my room, too -- remember that,
in my room!

<P>`One moment vet.' he said. `one moment before I take my leave. I ask
permission at parting to impress on you an urgent necessity. It is this,
sir. You must not think of waiting till Miss Halcombe recovers before you
receive Lady Glyde. Miss Halcombe has the attendance of the doctor, of
the housekeeper at Blackwater Park, and of an experienced nurse as well
-- three persons for whose capacity and devotion I answer with my life.
I tell you that. I tell you, also, that the anxiety and alarm of her sister's
illness has already affected the health and spirits of Lady Glyde, and
has made her totally unfit to be of use in the sickroom. Her position with
her husband grows more and more deplorable and dangerous every day. If
you leave her any longer at Blackwater Park, you do nothing whatever to
hasten her sister's recovery, and at the same time, you risk the public
scandal. which you and I, and all of us, are bound in the sacred interests
of the family to avoid. With all my soul, I advise you to remove the serious
responsibility of delay from your own shoulders by writing to Lady Glyde
to come here at once. Do your affectionate, your honourable, your inevitable
duty, and whatever happens in the future, no one can lay the blame on you.
I speak from my large experience -- I offer my friendly advice. Is it accepted
-- Yes, or No?'

<P>I looked at him -- merely looked at him -- with my sense of his amazing
assurance, and my dawning resolution to ring for Louis and have him shown
out of the room expressed in every line of my face. It is perfectly incredible,
but quite true, that my face did not appear to produce the slightest impression
on him. Born without nerves -- evidently born without nerves.

<P>`You hesitate?' he said. `Mr Fairlie! I understand that hesitation.
You object -- see, sir, how my sympathies look straight down into your
thoughts! -- you object that Lady Glyde is not in health and not in spirits
to take the long journey, from Hampshire to this place, by herself. Her
own maid is removed from her, as you know, and of other servants fit to
travel with her, from one end of England to another, there are none at
Blackwater Park. You object, again, that she cannot comfortably stop and
rest in London, on her way here, because she cannot comfortably go alone
to a public hotel where she is a total stranger. In one breath, I grant
both objections -- in another breath, I remove them. Follow me, if you
please, for the last time. It was my intention, when I returned to England
with Sir Percival, to settle myself in the neighbourhood of London. That
purpose has just been happily accomplished. I have taken, for six months,
a little furnished house in the quarter called St John's Wood. Be so obliging
as to keep this fact in your mind, and observe the programme I now propose.
Lady Glyde travels to London (a short journey) -- I myself meet her at
the station -- I take her to rest and sleep at my house, which is also
the house of her aunt -- when she is restored I escort her to the station
again -- she travels to this place, and her own maid (who is now under
your roof) receives her at the carriage-door. Here is comfort consulted
-- here are the interests of propriety consulted -- here is your own duty
-- duty of hospitality, sympathy, protection, to an unhappy lady in need
of all three -- smoothed and made easy, from the beginning to the end.
I cordially invite you, sir, to second my efforts in the sacred interests
of the family- I seriously advise you to write, by my hands, offering the
hospitality of your house (and heart), and the hospitality of my house
(and heart), to that injured and unfortunate lady whose cause I plead today.'

<P>He waved his horrid hand at me -- he struck his infectious breast --
he addressed me oratorically, as if I was laid up in the House of Commons.
It was high time to take a desperate course of some sort. It was also high
time to send for Louis, and adopt the precaution of fumigating the room.

<P>In this trying emergency an idea occurred to me -- an inestimable idea
which, so to speak, killed two intrusive birds with one stone. I determined
to get rid of the Count's tiresome eloquence, and of Lady Glyde's tiresome
troubles, by complying with this odious foreigner's request, and writing
the letter at once. There was not the least danger of the invitation being
accepted, for there was not the least chance that Laura would consent to
leave Blackwater Park while Marian was lying there ill. How this charmingly
convenient obstacle could have escaped the officious penetration of the
Count, it was impossible to conceive -- but it had escaped him. My dread
that he might yet discover it, if I allowed him any more time to think,
stimulated me to such an amazing degree, that I struggled into a sitting
position -- seized, really seized, the writing materials by my side, and
produced the letter as rapidly as if I had been a common clerk in an office.
`Dearest Laura, Please come, whenever you like. Break the journey by sleeping
in London at your aunt's house. Grieved to hear of dear Marian's illness.
Ever affectionately yours.' I handed these lines, at arm's length, to the
Count -- I sank back in my chair -- I said, `Excuse me -- I am entirely
prostrated -- I can do no more. Will you rest and lunch downstairs? Love
to all, and sympathy, and so on. Good morning.'

<P>He made another speech -- the man was absolutely inexhaustible. I closed
my eyes -- I endeavoured to hear as little as possible. In spite of my
endeavours I was obliged to hear a great deal. My sister's endless husband
congratulated himself, and congratulated me, on the result of our interview
-- he mentioned a great deal more about his sympathies and mine -- he deplored
my miserable health -- he offered to write me a prescription -- he impressed
on me the necessity of not forgetting what he had said about the importance
of light -- he accepted my obliging invitation to rest and lunch -- he
recommended me to expect Lady Glyde in two or three days' time -- he begged
my permission to look forward to our next meeting, instead of paining himself
and paining me, by saying farewell -- he added a great deal more, which,
I rejoice to think, I did not attend to at the time, and do not remember
now. I heard his sympathetic voice travelling away from me by degrees --
but, large as he was, I never heard <I>him.</I> He had the negative merit
of being absolutely noiseless. I don't know when he opened the door, or
when he shut it. I ventured to make use of my eyes again, after an interval
of silence -- and he was gone.

<P>I rang for Louis, and retired to my bathroom. Tepid water, strengthened
with aromatic vinegar, for myself, and copious fumigation for my study,
were the obvious precautions to take, and of course I adopted them. I rejoice
to say they proved successful. I enjoyed my customary siesta. I awoke moist
and cool.

<P>My first inquiries were for the Count. Had we really got rid of him?
Yes -- he had gone away by the afternoon train. Had he lunched, and if
so, upon what? Entirely upon fruit-tart and cream. What a man! What a digestion!

<P>Am I expected to say anything more? I believe not. I believe I have
reached the limits assigned to me. The shocking circumstances which happened
at a later period did not, I am thankful to say, happen in my presence.
I do beg and entreat that nobody will be so very unfeeling as to lay any
part of the blame of those circumstances on <I>me.</I> I did everything
for the best. I am not answerable for a deplorable calamity, which it was
quite impossible to foresee. I am shattered by it -- I have suffered under
it, as nobody else has suffered. My servant, Louis (who is really attached
to me in his unintelligent way), thinks I shall never get over it. He sees
me dictating at this moment, with my handkerchief to my eyes. I wish to
mention, in justice to myself, that it was not my fault, and that I am
quite exhausted and heartbroken. Need I say more?

THE STORY CONTINUED BY ELIZA MICHELSON (Housekeeper at Blackwater Park)</H2></CENTER>
I AM asked to state plainly what I know of the progress of Miss Halcombe's
illness and of the circumstances under which Lady Glyde left Blackwater
Park for London.

<P>The reason given for making this demand on me is, that my testimony
is wanted in the interests of truth. As the widow of a clergyman of the
Church of England (reduced by misfortune to the necessity of accepting
a situation), I have been taught to place the claims of truth above all
other considerations. I therefore comply with a request which I might otherwise.
through reluctance to connect myself with distressing family affairs, have
hesitated to grant.

<P>I made no memorandum at the time, and I cannot therefore be sure to
a day of the date, but I believe I am correct in stating that Miss Halcombe's
serious illness began during the last fortnight or ten days in June. The
breakfast hour was late at Blackwater Park -- sometimes as late as ten,
never earlier than half-past nine. On the morning to which I am now referring,
Miss Halcombe (who was usually the first to come down) did not make her
appearance at the table. After the family had waited a quarter of an hour,
the upper housemaid was sent to see after her, and came running out of
the room dreadfully frightened. I met the servant on the stairs, and went
at once to Miss Halcombe to see what was the matter. The poor lady was
incapable of telling me. She was walking about her room with a pen in her
hand, quite lightheaded, in a state of burning fever.

<P>Lady Glyde (being no longer in Sir Percival's service, I may, without
impropriety, mention my former mistress by her name, instead of calling
her my lady) was the first to come in from her own bedroom. She was so
dreadfully alarmed and distressed that she was quite useless. The Count
Fosco, and his lady, who came upstairs immediately afterwards, were both
most serviceable and kind. Her ladyship assisted me to get Miss Halcombe
to her bed. His lordship the Count remained in the sitting-room, and having
sent for my medicine-chest, made a mixture for Miss Halcombe, and a cooling
lotion to be applied to her head, so as to lose no time before the doctor
came. We applied the lotion, but we could not get her to take the mixture.
Sir Percival undertook to send for the doctor. He despatched a groom, on
horseback, for the nearest medical man, Mr Dawson, of Oak Lodge.

<P>Mr Dawson arrived in less than an hour's time. He was a respectable
elderly man, well known all round the country, and we were much alarmed
when we found that he considered the case to be a very serious one.

<P>His lordship the Count affably entered into conversation with Mr Dawson,
and gave his opinions with a judicious freedom. Mr Dawson, not over-courteously,
inquired if his lordship's advice was the advice of a doctor, and being
informed that it was the advice of one who had studied medicine unprofessionally,
replied that he was not accustomed to consult with amateur physicians.
The Count, with truly Christian meekness of temper, smiled and left the
room. Before he went out he told me that he might be found, in case he
was wanted in the course of the day, at the boat-house on the banks of
the lake. Why he should have gone there, I cannot say. But he did go, remaining
away the whole day till seven o'clock, which was dinner-time. Perhaps he
wished to set the example of keeping the house as quiet as possible. It
was entirely in his character to do so. He was a most considerate nobleman.

<P>Miss Halcombe passed a very bad night, the fever coming and going, and
getting worse towards the morning instead of better. No nurse fit to wait
on her being at hand in the neighbourhood, her ladyship the Countess and
myself undertook the duty, relieving each other. Lady Glyde, most unwisely,
insisted on sitting up with us. She was much too nervous and too delicate
in health to bear the anxiety of Miss Halcombe's illness calmly. She only
did herself harm, without being of the least real assistance. A more gentle
and affectionate lady never lived -- but she cried, and she was frightened,
two weaknesses which made her entirely unfit to be present in a sick-room.

<P>Sir Percival and the Count came in the morning to make their inquiries.

<P>Sir Percival (from distress. I presume, at his lady's affliction. and
at Hiss Halcombe's illness) appeared much confused and unsettled in his
mind. His lordship testified, on the contrary, a becoming composure and
interest. He had his straw hat in one hand, and his book in the other,
and he mentioned to Sir Percival in my hearing that he would go out again
and study at the lake. `Let us keep the house quiet,' he said. `Let us
not smoke indoors, my friend, now Miss Halcombe is ill. You go your way,
and I will go mine. When I study I like to be alone. Good morning, Mrs
Michelson.'

<P>Sir Percival was not civil enough -- perhaps I ought in justice to say,
not composed enough -- to take leave of me with the same Polite attention.
The only person in the house, indeed, who treated me, at that time or at
any other, on the footing of a lady in distressed circumstances, was the
Count. He had the manners of a true nobleman -- he was considerate towards
every one. Even the young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde
was not beneath his notice. When she was sent away by Sir Percival, his
lordship (showing me his sweet little birds at the time) was most kindly
anxious to know what had become of her, where she was to go the day she
left Blackwater Park, and so on. It is in such little delicate attentions
that the advantages of aristocratic birth always show themselves. I make
no apology for introducing these particulars -- they are brought forward
in justice to his lordship, whose character, I have reason to know, is
viewed rather harshly in certain quarters. A nobleman who can respect a
lady in distressed circumstances, and can take a fatherly interest in the
fortunes of an humble servant girl, shows principles and feelings of too
high an order to be lightly called in question. I advance no opinions --
I offer facts only. My endeavour through life is to judge not that I be
not judged. One of my beloved husband's finest sermons was on that text.
I read it constantly -- in my own copy of the edition printed by subscription,
in the first days of my widowhood -- and at every fresh perusal I derive
an increase of spiritual benefit and edification.

<P>There was no improvement in Miss Halcombe, and the second night was
even worse than the first. Mr Dawson was constant in his attendance. The
practical duties of nursing were still divided between the Countess and
myself, Lady Glyde persisting in sitting up with us, though we both entreated
her to take some rest. `My place is by Marian's bedside,' was her only
answer. `Whether I am ill, or well, nothing will induce me to lose sight
of her.'

<P>Towards midday I went downstairs to attend to some of my regular duties.
An hour afterwards, on my way back to the sickroom, I saw the Count (who
had gone out again early, for the third time) entering the hall, to all
appearance in the highest good spirits. Sir Percival, at the same moment,
put his head out of the library door, and addressed his noble friend, with
extreme eagerness, in these words --

<P>`Have you found her?'

<P>His lordship's large face became dimpled all over with placid smiles,
but he made no reply in words. At the same time Sir Percival turned his
head, observed that I was approaching the stairs, and looked at me in the
most rudely angry manner possible

<P>`Come in here and tell me about it,' he said to the Count. `Whenever
there are women in a house they're always sure to be going up or down stairs.'

<P>`My dear Percival,' observed his lordship kindly, `Mrs Michelson has
duties. Pray recognise her admirable performance of them as sincerely as
I do! How is the sufferer, Mrs Michelson?'

<P>`No better, my lord, I regret to say.'

<P>`Sad -- most sad!' remarked the Count. `You look fatigued, Mrs Michelson.
It is certainly time you and my wife had some help in nursing. I think
I may be the means of offering you that help. Circumstances have happened
which will oblige Madame Fosco to travel to London either tomorrow or the
day after. She will go away in the morning and return at night, and she
will bring back with her, to relieve you, a nurse of excellent conduct
and capacity, who is now disengaged. The woman is known to my wife as a
person to be trusted. Before she comes here say nothing about her, if you
please, to the doctor, because he will look with an evil eye on any nurse
of my providing. When she appears in this house she will speak for herself,
and Mr Dawson will be obliged to acknowledge that there is no excuse for
not employing her. Lady Glyde will say the same. Pray present my best respects
and sympathies to Lady Glyde.'

<P>I expressed my grateful acknowledgments for his lordship's kind consideration.
Sir Percival cut them short by calling to his noble friend (using, regret
to say, a profane expression) to come into the library, and not to keep
him waiting there any longer.

<P>I proceeded upstairs. We are poor erring creatures, and however well
established a woman's principles may be she cannot always keep on her guard
against the temptation to exercise an idle curiosity. I am ashamed to say
that an idle curiosity, on this occasion, got the better of my principles,
and made me unduly inquisitive about the question which Sir Percival had
addressed to his noble friend at the library door. Who was the Count expected
to find in the course of his studious morning rambles at Blackwater Park?
A woman, it was to be presumed, from the terms of Sir Percival's inquiry.
I did not suspect the Count of any impropriety -- I knew his moral character
too well. The only question I asked myself was -- Had he found her?
