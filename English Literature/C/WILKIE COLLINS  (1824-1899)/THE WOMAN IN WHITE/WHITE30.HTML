The story of my first inquiries in Hampshire is soon told.

<P>My early departure from London enabled me to reach Mr Dawson's house
in the forenoon. Our interview, so far as the object of my visit was concerned,
led to no satisfactory result.

<P>Mr Dawson's books certainly showed when he had resumed his attendance
on Miss Halcombe at Blackwater Park, but it was not possible to calculate
back from this date with any exactness, without such help from Mrs Michelson
as I knew she was unable to afford. She could not say from memory (who,
in similar cases, ever can?) how many days had elapsed between the renewal
of the doctor's attendance on his patient and the previous departure of
Lady Glyde. She was almost certain of having mentioned the circumstance
of the departure to Miss Halcombe, on the day after it happened -- but
then she was no more able to fix the date of the day on which this disclosure
took place, than to fix the date of the day before, when Lady Glyde had
left for London. Neither could she calculate, with any nearer approach
to exactness, the time that had passed from the departure of her mistress,
to the Period when the undated letter from Madame Fosco arrived. Lastly,
as if to complete the series of difficulties, the doctor himself, having
been ill at the time, had omitted to make his usual entry of the day of
the week and month when the gardener from Blackwater Park had called on
him to deliver Mrs Michelson's message.

<P>Hopeless of obtaining assistance from Mr Dawson, I resolved to try next
if I could establish the date of Sir Percival's arrival at Knowlesbury.

<P>It seemed like a fatality! When I reached Knowlesbury the inn was shut
up, and bills were posted on the walls. The speculation had been a bad
one, as I was informed, ever since the time of the railway. The new hotel
at the station had gradually absorbed the business,19 and the old inn (which
we knew to be the inn at which Sir Percival had put up), had been closed
about two months since. The proprietor had left the town with all his goods
and chattels, and where he had gone I could not positively ascertain from
any one. The four people of whom I inquired gave me four different accounts
of his plans and projects when he left Knowlesbury.

<P>There were still some hours to spare before the last train left for
London, and I drove back again in a fly from the Knowlesbury station to
Blackwater Park, with the purpose of questioning the gardener and the person
who kept the lodge. If they, too, proved unable to assist me, my resources
for the present were at an end, and I might return to town.

<P>I dismissed the fly a mile distant from the park, and getting my directions
from the driver, proceeded by myself to the house.

<P>As I turned into the lane from the high-road, I saw a man, with a carpet-bag,
walking before me rapidly on the way to the lodge. He was a little man,
dressed in shabby black, and wearing a remarkably large hat. I set him
down (as well as it was possible to judge) for a lawyer's clerk, and stopped
at once to widen the distance between us. He had not heard me, and he walked
on out of sight, without looking back. When I passed through the gates
myself, a little while afterwards, he was not visible -- he had evidently
gone on to the house.

<P>There were two women in the lodge. One of them was old, the other I
knew at once, by Marian's description of her, to be Margaret Porcher.

<P>I asked first if Sir Percival was at the Park, and receiving a reply
in the negative, inquired next when he had left it. Neither of the women
could tell me more than that he had gone away in the summer. I could extract
nothing from Margaret Porcher but vacant smiles and shakings of the head.
The old woman was a little more intelligent, and I managed to lead her
into speaking of the manner of Sir Percival's departure, and of the alarm
that it caused her. She remembered her master calling her out of bed, and
remembered his frightening her by swearing -- but the date at which the
occurrence happened was, as she honestly acknowledged, `quite beyond her.'

<P>On leaving the lodge I saw the gardener at work not far off. When I
first addressed him, he looked at me rather distrustfully, but on my using
Mrs Michelson's name, with a civil reference to himself, he entered into
conversation readily enough. There is no need to describe what passed between
us -- it ended, as all my other attempts to discover the date had ended.
The gardener knew that his master had driven away, at night, `some time
in July, the last fortnight or the last ten days in the month' -- and knew
no more.

<P>While we were speaking together I saw the man in black, with the large
hat, come out from the house, and stand at some little distance observing
us.

<P>Certain suspicions of his errand at Blackwater Park had already crossed
my mind. They were now increased by the gardener's inability (or unwillingness)
to tell me who the man was, and I determined to clear the way before me,
if possible, by speaking to him. The plainest question I could put as a
stranger would be to inquire if the house was allowed to be shown to visitors.
I walked up to the man at once, and accosted him in those words.

<P>His look and manner unmistakably betrayed that he knew who I was, and
that he wanted to irritate me into quarrelling with him. His reply was
insolent enough to have answered the purpose, if I had been less determined
to control myself. As it was, I met him with the most resolute politeness,
apologised for my involuntary intrusion (which he called a `trespass,')
and left the grounds. It was exactly as I suspected. The recognition of
me when I left Mr Kyrle's office had been evidently communicated to Sir
Percival Glyde, and the man in black had been sent to the Park in anticipation
of my making inquiries at the house or in the neighbourhood. If I had given
him the least chance of lodging any sort of legal complaint against me,
the interference of the local magistrate would no doubt have been turned
to account as a clog on my proceedings, and a means of separating me from
Marian and Laura for some days at least.

<P>I was prepared to be watched on the way from Blackwater Park to the
station, exactly as I had been watched in London the day before.- But I
could not discover at the time, whether I was really followed on this occasion
or not. The man in black might have had means of tracking me at his disposal
of which I was not aware, but I certainly saw nothing of him, in his own
person, either on the way to the station, or afterwards on my arrival at
the London terminus in the evening. I reached home on foot, taking the
precaution, before I approached our own door, of walking round by the loneliest
street in the neighbourhood, and there stopping and looking back more than
once over the open space behind me. I had first learnt to use this stratagem
against suspected treachery in the wilds of Central America -- and now
I was practising it again, with the same purpose and with even greater
caution, in the heart of civilised London I

<P>Nothing had happened to alarm Marian during my absence. She asked eagerly
what success I had met with. When I told her she could not conceal her
surprise at the indifference with which I spoke of the failure of my investigations
thus far.

<P>The truth was, that the ill-success of my inquiries had in no sense
daunted me. I had pursued them as a matter of duty, and I had expected
nothing from them. In the state of my mind at that time, it was almost
a relief to me to know that the struggle was now narrowed to a trial of
strength between myself and Sir Percival Glyde. The vindictive motive had
mingled itself all along with my other and better motives, and I confess
it was a satisfaction to me to feel that the surest way, the only way left,
of serving Laura's cause, was to fasten my hold firmly on the villain who
had married her.

<P>While I acknowledge that I was not strong enough to keep my motives
above the reach of this instinct of revenge, I can honestly say something
in my own favour on the other side. No base speculation on the future relations
of Laura and myself, and on the private and personal concessions which
I might force from Sir Percival if I once had him at my mercy, ever entered
my mind. I never said to myself, `If I do succeed, it shall be one result
of my success that I put it out of her husband's power to take her from
me again.' I could not look at her and think of the future with such thoughts
as those. The sad sight of the change in her from her former self, made
the one interest of my love an interest of tenderness and compassion which
her father or her brother might have felt, and which I felt, God knows,
in my inmost heart. All my hopes looked no farther on now than to the day
of her recovery. There, till she was strong again and happy again -- there,
till she could look at me as she had once looked, and speak to me as she
had once spoken -- the future of my happiest thoughts and my dearest wishes
ended.

<P>These words are written under no prompting of idle self-contemplation.
Passages in this narrative are soon to come which will set the minds of
others in judgment on my conduct. It is right that the best and the worst
of me should be fairly balanced before that time.

<P>On the morning after my return from Hampshire I took Marian upstairs
into my working-room, and there laid before her the plan that I had matured
thus far, for mastering the one assailable point in the life of Sir Percival
Glyde.

<P>The way to the Secret lay through the mystery, hitherto impenetrable
to all of us, of the woman in white. The approach to that in its turn might
be gained by obtaining the assistance of Anne Catherick's mother, and the
only ascertainable means of prevailing on Mrs Catherick to act or to speak
in the matter depended on the chance of my discovering local particulars
and family particulars first of all from Mrs Clements. After thinking the
subject over carefully, I felt certain that I could only begin the new
inquiries by placing myself in communication with the faithful friend and
protectress of Anne Catherick.

<P>The first difficulty then was to find Mrs Clements.

<P>I was indebted to Marian's quick perception for meeting this necessity
at once by the best and simplest means. She proposed to write to the farm
near Limmeridge (Todd's Corner), to inquire whether Mrs Clements had communicated
with Mrs Todd during the past few months. How Mrs Clements had been separated
from Anne it was impossible for us to say, but that separation once effected,
it would certainly occur to Mrs Clements to inquire after the missing woman
in the neighbourhood of all others to which she was known to be most attached
-- the neighbourhood of Limmeridge. I saw directly that Marian's proposal
offered us a prospect of success, and she wrote to Mrs Todd accordingly
by that day's post.

<P>While we were waiting for the reply, I made myself master of all the
information Marian could afford on the subject of Sir percival's family,
and of his early life. She could only speak on these topics from heresay,
but she was reasonably certain of the truth of what little she had to tell.

<P>Sir Percival was an only child. His father, Sir felix Glyde, had suffered
from his birth under a painful and incurable deformity, and had shunned
all society from his earliest years. His sole happiness was in the enjoyment
of music, and he had married a lady with tastes similar to his own, who
was said to be a most accomplished musician. He inherited the Blackwater
property while still a young man. Neither he nor his wife, after taking
possession, made advances of any sort towards the society of the neighbourhood,
and no one endeavoured to tempt them into abandoning their reserve, with
the one disastrous exception of the rector of the parish.

<P>The rector was the worst of all innocent mischief-makers -- an over-zealous
man. He had heard that Sir Felix had left College with the character of
being little better than a revolutionist in politics and an infidel in
religion, and he arrived conscientiously at the conclusion that it was
his bounden duty to summon the lord of the manor to hear sound views enunciated
in the parish church. Sir Felix fiercely resented the clergyman's well-meant
but ill-directed interference, insulting him so grossly and so publicly,
that the families in the neighbourhood sent letters of indignant remonstrance
to the Park, and even the tenants of the Blackwater property expressed
their opinion as strongly as they dared. The baronet, who had no country
tastes of any kind, and no attachment to the estate or to any one living
on it, declared that society at Blackwater should never have a second chance
of annoying him, and left the place from that moment.

<P>After a short residence in London he and his wife departed for the Continent,
and never returned to England again. They lived part of the time in France
and part in Germany -- always keeping themselves in the strict retirement
which the morbid sense of his own personal deformity had made a necessity
to Sir Felix. Their son, Percival, had been born abroad, and had been educated
there by private tutors. His mother was the first of his parents whom he
lost. His father had died a few years after her, either in 1825 or 1826.
Sir Percival had been in England, as a young man, once or twice before
that period, but his acquaintance with the late Mr Fairlie did not begin
till after the time of his father's death. They soon became very intimate,
although Sir Percival was seldom, or never, at Limmeridge House in those
days. Mr Frederick Fairlie might have met him once or twice in Mr Philip
Fairlie's company, but he could have known little of him at that or at
any other time. Sir Percival's only intimate friend in the Fairlie family
had been Laura's father.

<P>These were all the particulars that I could gain from Marian. They suggested
nothing which was useful to my present purpose, but I noted them down carefully,
in the event of their proving to be of importance at any future period.

<P>Mrs Todd's reply (addressed, by our own wish, to a post-office at some
distance from us) had arrived at its destination when I went to apply for
it. The chances, which had been all against us hitherto, turned from this
moment in our favour. Mrs Todd's letter contained the first item of information
of which we were in search.

<P>Mrs Clements, it appeared, had (as we had conjectured) written to Todd's
Corner, asking pardon in the first place for the abrupt manner in which
she and Anne had left their friends at the farm-house (on the morning after
I had met the woman in white in Limmeridge churchyard), and then informing
Mrs Todd of Anne's disappearance, and entreating that she would cause inquiries
to be made in the neighbourhood, on the chance that the lost woman might
have strayed back to Limmeridge. In making this request, Mrs Clements had
been careful to add to it the address at which she might always be heard
of, and that address Mrs Todd now transmitted to Marian. It was in London,
and within half an hour's walk of our own lodging.

<P>In the words of the proverb, I was resolved not to let the grass grow
under my feet. The next morning I set forth to seek an interview with Mrs
Clements. This was my first step forward in the investigation. The story
of the desperate attempt to which I now stood committed begins here.
<CENTER>
<H2>
VI</H2></CENTER>
The address communicated by Mrs Todd took me to a lodging-house situated
in a respectable street near the Gray's Inn Road.

<P>When I knocked the door was opened by Mrs Clements herself. She did
not appear to remember me, and asked what my business was. I recalled to
her our meeting in Limmeridge churchyard at the close of my interview there
with the woman in white, taking special care to remind her that I was the
person who assisted Anne Catherick (as Anne had herself declared) to escape
the pursuit from the Asylum. This was my only claim to the confidence of
Mrs Clements. She remembered the circumstance the moment I spoke of it,
and asked me into the parlour, in the greatest anxiety to know if I had
brought her any news of Anne.

<P>It was impossible for me to tell her the whole truth without, at the
same time, entering into particulars on the subject of the conspiracy which
it would have been dangerous to confide to a stranger. I could only abstain
most carefully from raising any false hopes, and then explain that the
object of my visit was to discover the persons who were really responsible
for Anne's disappearance. I even added, so as to exonerate myself from
any after-reproach of my own conscience, that I entertained not the least
hope of being able to trace her -- that I believed we should never see
her alive again -- and that my main interest in the affair was to bring
to punishment two men whom I suspected to be concerned in luring her away,
and at whose hands I and some dear friends of mine had suffered a grievous
wrong. With this explanation I left it to Mrs Clements to say whether our
interest in the matter (whatever difference there might be in the motives
which actuated us) was not the same, and whether she felt any reluctance
to forward my objects by giving me such information on the subject of my
inquiries as she happened to possess.

<P>The Poor woman was at first too much confused and agitated to understand
thoroughly what I said to her. She could only reply that I was welcome
to anything she could tell me in return for the kindness I had shown to
Anne; but as she was not very quick and ready, at the best of times, in
talking to strangers, she would beg me to put her in the right way, and
to say where I wished her to begin.

<P>Knowing by experience that the plainest narrative attainable from persons
who are not accustomed to arrange their ideas, is the narrative which goes
far enough back at the beginning to avoid all impediments of retrospection
in its course, I asked Mrs Clements to tell me first what had happened
after she had left Limmeridge, and so, by watchful questioning, carried
her on from point to point, till we reached the period of Anne's disappearance.

<P>The substance of the information which I thus obtained was as follows
: --

<P>On leaving the farm at Todd's Corner, Mrs Clements and Anne had travelled
that day as far as Derby, and had remained there a week on Anne's account.
They had then gone on to London, and had lived in the lodging occupied
by Mrs Clements at that time for a month or more, when circumstances connected
with the house and the landlord had obliged them to change their quarters.
Anne's terror of being discovered in London or its neighbourhood, whenever
they ventured to walk out, had gradually communicated itself to Mrs Clements,
and she had determined on removing to one of the most out-of-the-way places
in England -- to the town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire, where her deceased
husband had passed all his early life. His relatives were respectable people
settled in the town -- they had always treated Mrs Clements with great
kindness, and she thought it impossible to do better than go there and
take the advice of her husband's friends. Anne would not hear of returning
to her mother at Welmingham, because she had been removed to the Asylum
from that place, and because Sir Percival would be certain to go back there
and find her again. There was serious weight in this objection, and Mrs
Clements felt that it was not to be easily removed.

<P>At Grimsby the first serious symptoms of illness had shown themselves
in Anne. They appeared soon after the news of Lady Glyde's marriage had
been made public in the newspapers, and had reached her through that medium.

<P>The medical man who was sent for to attend the sick woman discovered
at once that she was suffering from a serious affection of the heart. The
illness lasted long, left her very weak, and returned at intervals, though
with mitigated severity, again and again. They remained at Grimsby, in
consequence, during the first half of the new year, and there they might
probably have stayed much longer, but for the sudden resolution which Anne
took at this time to venture back to Hampshire, for the purpose of obtaining
a private interview with Lady Glyde.

<P>Mrs Clements did all in her power to oppose the execution of this hazardous
and unaccountable project. No explanation of her motives was offered by
Anne, except that she believed the day of her death was not far off, and
that she had something on her mind which must be communicated to Lady Glyde,
at any risk, in secret. Her resolution to accomplish this purpose was so
firmly settled that she declared her intention of going to Hampshire by
herself if Mrs Clements felt any unwillingness to go with her. The doctor,
on being consulted, was of opinion that serious opposition to her wishes
would, in all probability, produce another and perhaps a fatal fit of illness,
and Mrs Clements, under this advice, yielded to necessity, and once more,
with sad forebodings of trouble and danger to come, allowed Anne Catherick
to have her own way.

<P>On the journey from London to Hampshire Mrs Clements discovered that
one of their fellow-passengers was well acquainted with the neighbourhood
of Blackwater, and could give her all the information she needed on the
subject of localities. In this way she found out that the only place they
could go to, which was not dangerously near to Sir Percival's residence,
was a large village called Sandon. The distance here from Blackwater Park
was between three and four miles -- and that distance, and back again,
Anne had walked on each occasion when she had appeared in the neighbourhood
of the lake.

<P>For the few days during which they were at Sandon without being discovered
they had lived a little away from the village, in the cottage of a decent
widow-woman who had a bedroom to let, and whose discreet silence Mrs Clements
had done her best to secure, for the first week at least. She had also
tried hard to induce Anne to be content with writing to Lady Glyde, in
the first instance; but the failure of the warning contained in the anonymous
letter sent to Limmeridge had made Anne resolute to speak this time, and
obstinate in the determination to go on her errand alone.

<P>Mrs Clements, nevertheless, followed her privately on each occasion
when she went to the lake, without, however, venturing near enough to the
boat-house to be witness of what took place there. When Anne returned for
the last time from the dangerous neighbourhood, the fatigue of walking,
day after day, distances which were far too great for her strength, added
to the exhausting effect of the agitation from which she had suffered,
produced the result which Mrs Clements had dreaded all along. The old pain
over the heart and the other symptoms of the illness at Grimsby returned,
and Anne was confined to her bed in the cottage.

<P>In this emergency the first necessity, as Mrs Clements knew by experience,
was to endeavour to quiet Anne's anxiety of mind, and for this purpose
the good woman went herself the next day to the lake, to try if she could
find Lady Glyde (who would be sure, as Anne said, to take her daily walk
to the boat-house), and prevail on her to come back privately to the cottage
near Sandon. On reaching the outskirts of the plantation Mrs Clements encountered,
not Lady Glyde, but a tall, stout, elderly gentleman, with a book in his
hand -- in other words, Count Fosco.

<P>The Count, after looking at her very attentively for a moment, asked
if she expected to see any one in that place, and added, before she could
reply, that he was waiting there with a message from Lady Glyde, but that
he was not quite certain whether the person then before him answered the
description of the person with whom he was desired to communicate.

<P>Upon this Mrs Clements at once confided her errand to him, and entreated
that he would help to allay Anne's anxiety by trusting his message to her.
The Count most readily and kindly complied with her request. The message,
he said, was a very important one. Lady Glyde entreated Anne and her good
friend to return immediately to London, as she felt certain that Sir Percival
would discover them if they remained any longer in the neighbourhood of
Blackwater. She was herself going to London in a short time, and if Mrs
Clements and Anne would go there first, and would let her know what their
address was, they should hear from her and see her in a fortnight or less.
The Count added that he had already attempted to give a friendly warning
to Anne herself, but that she had been too much startled by seeing that
he was a stranger to let him approach and speak to her.

<P>To this Mrs Clements replied, in the greatest alarm and distress, that
she asked nothing better than to take Anne safely to London, but that there
was no present hope of removing her from the dangerous neighbourhood, as
she lay ill in her bed at that moment. The Count inquired if Mrs Clements
had sent for medical advice, and hearing that she had hitherto hesitated
to do so, from the fear of making their position publicly known in the
village, informed her that he was himself a medical man, and that he would
go back with her if she pleased, and see what could be done for Anne. Mrs
Clements (feeling a natural confidence in the Count, as a person trusted
with a secret message from Lady Glyde) gratefully accepted the offer, and
they went back together to the cottage.

<P>Anne was asleep when they got there. The Count started at the sight
of her (evidently from astonishment at her resemblance to Lady Glyde).
Poor Mrs Clements supposed that he was only shocked to see how ill she
was. He would not allow her to be awakened -- he was contented with putting
questions to Mrs Clements about her symptoms, with looking at her, and
with lightly touching her pulse. Sandon was a large enough place to have
a grocer's and druggist's shop in it, and thither the Count went to write
his prescription and to get the medicine made up. He brought it back himself,
and told Mrs Clements that the medicine was a powerful stimulant, and that
it would certainly give Anne strength to get up and bear the fatigue of
a journey to London of only a few hours. The remedy was to be administered
at stated times on that day and on the day after. On the third day she
would be well enough to travel, and he arranged to meet Mrs Clements at
the Blackwater station, and to see them off by the mid-day train. If they
did not appear he would assume that Anne was worse, and would proceed at
once to the cottage.

<P>As events turned out, no such emergency as this occurred.

<P>This medicine had an extraordinary effect on Anne, and the good results
of it were helped by the assurance Mrs Clements could now give her that
she would soon see Lady Glyde in London. At the appointed day and time
(when they had not been quite so long as a week in Hampshire altogether),
they arrived at the station. The Count was waiting there for them, and
was talking to an elderly lady, who appeared to be going to travel by the
train to London also. He most kindly assisted them, and put them in to
the carriage himself, begging Mrs Clements not to forget to send her address
to Lady Glyde. The elderly lady did not travel in the same compartment,
and they did not notice what became of her on reaching the London terminus.
Mrs Clements secured respectable lodgings in a quiet neighbourhood, and
then wrote, as she had engaged to do, to inform Lady Glyde of the address.

<P>A little more than a fortnight passed, and no answer came.

<P>At the end of that time a lady (the same elderly lady whom they had
seen at the station) called in a cab, and said that she came from Lady
Glyde, who was then at an hotel in London, and who wished to see Mrs Clements,
for the purpose of arranging a future interview with Anne. Mrs Clements
expressed her willingness (Anne being present at the time, and entreating
her to do so) to forward the object in view, especially as she was not
required to be away from the house for more than half an hour at the most.
She and the elderly lady (clearly Madame Fosco) then left in the cab. The
lady stopped the cab, after it had driven some distance, at a shop before
they got to the hotel, and begged Mrs Clements to wait for her for a few
minutes while she made a purchase that had been forgotten. She never appeared
again.

<P>After waiting some time Mrs Clements became alarmed, and ordered the
cabman to drive back to her lodgings. When she got there, after an absence
of rather more than half an hour, Anne was gone.

<P>The only information to be obtained from the people of the house was
derived from the servant who waited on the lodgers. She had opened the
door to a boy from the street, who had left a letter for `the young woman
who lived on the second floor' (the part of the house which Mrs Clements
occupied). The servant had delivered the letter, had then gone downstairs,
and five minutes afterwards had observed Anne open the front door and go
out dressed in her bonnet and shawl. She had probably taken the letter
with her, for it was not to be found, and it was therefore impossible to
tell what inducement had been offered to make her leave the house. It must
have been a strong one, for she would never stir out alone in London of
her own accord. If Mrs Clements had not known this by experience nothing
would have induced her to go away in the cab, even for so short a time
as half an hour only.

<P>As soon as she could collect her thoughts, the first idea that naturally
occurred to Mrs Clements was to go and make inquiries at the Asylum, to
which she dreaded that Anne had been taken back.

<P>She went there the next day, having been informed of the locality in
which the house was situated by Anne herself. The answer she received (her
application having in all probability been made a day or two before the
false Anne Catherick had really been consigned to safe keeping in the Asylum)
was, that no such person had been brought back there. She had then written
to Mrs Catherick at Welmingham to know if she had seen or heard anything
of her daughter, and had received an answer in the negative. After that
reply had reached her, she was at the end of her resources, and perfectly
ignorant where else to inquire or what else to do. From that time to this
she had remained in total ignorance of the cause of Anne's disappearance
and of the end of Anne's story.
