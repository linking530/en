Chapter 28</H1></CENTER>
Lady Glyde's recollection of the events which followed her departure from
Blackwater Park began with her arrival at the London terminus of the South
Western Railway. She had omitted to make a memorandum beforehand of the
day on which she took the journey. All hope of fixing that important date
by any evidence of hers, or of Mrs Michelson's, must be given up for lost.

<P>On the arrival of the train at the platform Lady Glyde found Count Fosco
waiting for her. He was at the carriage door as soon as the porter could
open it. The train was unusually crowded, and there was great confusion
in getting the luggage. Some person whom Count Fosco brought with him procured
the luggage which belonged to Lady Glyde. It was marked with her name.
She drove away alone with the Count in a vehicle which she did not particularly
notice at the time.

<P>Her first question, on leaving the terminus, referred to Miss Halcombe.
The Count informed her that Miss Halcombe had not yet gone to Cumberland,
after-consideration having caused him to doubt the prudence of her taking
so long a journey without some days' previous rest.

<P>Lady Glyde next inquired whether her sister was then staying in the
Count's house. Her recollection of the answer was confused, her only distinct
impression in relation to it being that the Count declared he was then
taking her to see Miss Halcombe. Lady Glyde's experience of London was
so limited that she could not tell, at the time, through what streets they
were driving. But they never left the streets, and they never passed any
gardens or trees. When the carriage stopped, it stopped in a small street
behind a square -- a square in which there were shops, and public buildings,
and many people. From these recollections (of which Lady Glyde was certain)
it seems quite clear that Count Fosco did not take her to his own residence
in the suburb of St John's Wood.

<P>They entered the house, and went upstairs to a back room, either on
the first or second floor. The luggage was carefully brought in. A female
servant opened the door, and a man with a dark beard, apparently a foreigner,
met them in the hall, and with great politeness showed them the way upstairs.
In answer to Lady Glyde's inquiries, the Count assured her that Miss Halcombe
was in the house, and that she should be immediately informed of her sister's
arrival. He and the foreigner then went away and left her by herself in
the room. It was poorly furnished as a sitting-room, and it looked out
on the backs of houses.

<P>The place was remarkably quiet -- no footsteps went up or down the stairs
-- she only heard in the room beneath her a dull, rumbling sound of men's
voices talking. Before she had been long left alone the Count returned,
to explain that Miss Halcombe was then taking rest, and could not be disturbed
for a little while. He was accompanied into the room by a gentleman (an
Englishman), whom he legged to present as a friend of his.

<P>After this singular introduction -- in the course of which no names,
to the best of Lady Glyde's recollection, had been mentioned -- she was
left alone with the stranger. He was perfectly civil, but he startled and
confused her by some odd questions about herself, and by looking at her,
while he asked them, in a strange manner. After remaining a short time
he went out, and a minute or two afterwards a second stranger -- also an
Englishman -- came in. This person introduced himself as another friend
of Count Fosco's, and he, in his turn, looked at her very oddly, and asked
some curious questions -- never, as well as she could remember, addressing
her by name, and going out again, after a little while, like the first
man. By this time she was so frightened about herself, and so uneasy about
her sister, that she had thoughts of venturing downstairs again, and claiming
the protection and assistance of the only woman she had seen in the house
-- the servant who answered the door.

<P>Just as she had risen from her chair, the Count came back into the room.

<P>The moment he appeared she asked anxiously how long the meeting between
her sister and herself was to be still delayed. At first he returned an
evasive answer, but on being pressed, he acknowledged, with great apparent
reluctance, that Miss Halcombe was by no means so well as he had hitherto
represented her to be. His tone and manner, in making this reply, so alarmed
Lady Glyde, or rather so painfully increased the uneasiness which she had
felt in the company of the two strangers, that a sudden faintness overcame
her, and she was obliged to ask for a glass of water. The Count called
from the door for water, and for a bottle of smelling-salts. Both were
brought in by the foreign-looking man with the beard. The water, when Lady
Glyde attempted to drink it, had so strange a taste that it increased her
faintness, and she hastily took the bottle of salts from Count Fosco, and
smelt at it. Her head became giddy on the instant. The Count caught the
bottle as it dropped out of her hand, and the last impression of which
she was conscious was that he held it to her nostrils again.

<P>From this point her recollections were found to be confused, fragmentary,
and difficult to reconcile with any reasonable probability.

<P>Her own impression was that she recovered her senses later in the evening,
that she then left the house, that she went (as she had previously arranged
to go, at Blackwater Park) to Mrs Vesey's -- that she drank tea there,
and that she passed the night under Mrs Vesey's roof. She was totally unable
to say how, or when, or in what company she left the house to which Count
Fosco had brought her. But she persisted in asserting that she had been
to Mrs Vesey's, and still more extraordinary, that she had been helped
to undress and get to bed by Mrs Rubelle! She could not remember what the
conversation was at Mrs Vesey's, or whom she saw there besides that lady,
or why Mrs Rubelle should have been present in the house to help her.

<P>Her recollection of what happened to her the next morning was still
more vague and unreliable.

<P>She had some dim idea of driving out (at what hour she could not say)
with Count Fosco, and with Mrs Rubelle again for a female attendant. But
when, and why, she left Mrs Vesey she could not tell; neither did she know
what direction the carriage drove in, or where it set her down, or whether
the Count and Mrs Rubelle did or did not remain with her all the time she
was out. At this point in her sad story there was a total blank. She had
no impressions of the faintest kind to communicate -- no idea whether one
day, or more than one day, had passed -- until she came to herself suddenly
in a strange place, surrounded by women who were all unknown to her.

<P>This was the Asylum. Here she first heard herself called by Anne Catherick's
name, and here, as a last remarkable circumstance in the story of the conspiracy,
her own eyes informed her that she had Anne Catherick's clothes on. The
nurse, on the first night in the Asylum, had shown her the marks on each
article of her underclothing as it was taken off, and had said, not at
all irritably or unkindly, `took at your own name on your own clothes,
and don't worry us all any more about being Lady Glyde. She's dead and
buried, and you're alive and hearty. Do look at your clothes now! There
it is, in good marking ink, and there you will find it on all your old
things, which we have kept in the house -- Anne Catherick, as plain as
print!' And there it was, when Miss Halcombe examined the linen her sister
wore, on the night of their arrival at Limmeridge House.

<P>These were the only recollections -- all of them uncertain, and some
of them contradictory -- which could be extracted from Lady Glyde by careful
questioning on the journey to Cumberland. Miss Halcombe abstained from
pressing her with any inquiries relating to events in the Asylum -- her
mind being but too evidently unfit to bear the trial of reverting to them.
It was known, by the voluntary admission of the owner of the madhouse,
that she was received there on the twenty-seventh of July. From that date
until the fifteenth of October (the day of her rescue) she had been under
restraint, her identity with Anne Catherick systematically asserted, and
her sanity, from first to last, practically denied. Faculties less delicately
balanced, constitution less tenderly organised, must have suffered under
such an ordeal as this. No man could have gone through it and come out
of it unchanged.

<P>Arriving at Limmeridge late on the evening of the fifteenth, Miss Halcombe
wisely resolved not to attempt the assertion of Lady Glyde's identity until
the next day.

<P>The first thing in the morning she went to Mr Fairlie's room, and using
all possible cautions and preparations beforehand, at last told him in
so many words what had happened. As soon as his first astonishment and
alarm had subsided, he angrily declared that Miss Halcombe had allowed
herself to be duped by Anne Catherick. He referred her to Count Fosco's
letter, and to what she had herself told him of the personal resemblance
between Anne and his deceased niece, and he positively declined to admit
to his presence, even for one minute only, a madwoman, whom it was an insult
and an outrage to have brought into his house at all.

<P>Miss Halcombe left the room -- waited till the first heat of her indignation
had passed away -- decided on reflection that Mr Fairlie should see his
niece in the interests of common humanity before he closed his doors on
her as a stranger -- and thereupon, without a word of previous warning,
took Lady Glyde with her to his room. The servant was posted at the door
to prevent their entrance, but Miss Halcombe insisted on passing him, and
made her way into Mr Fairlie's presence, leading her sister by the hand.

<P>The scene that followed, though it only lasted for a few minutes, was
too painful to be described -- Miss Halcombe herself shrank from referring
to it. Let it be enough to say that Mr Fairlie declared, in the most positive
terms, that he did not recognise the woman who had been brought into his
room -- that he saw nothing in her face and manner to make him doubt for
a moment that his niece lay buried in Limmeridge churchyard, and that he
would call on the law to protect him if before the day was over she was
not removed from the house.

<P>Taking the very worst view of Mr Fairlie's selfishness, indolence, and
habitual want of feeling, it was manifestly impossible to suppose that
he was capable of such infamy as secretly recognising and openly disowning
his brother's child. Miss Halcombe humanely and sensibly allowed all due
force to the influence of prejudice and alarm in preventing him from fairly
exercising his perceptions, and accounted for what had happened in that
way. But when she next put the servants to the test, and found that they
too were, in every case, uncertain, to say the least of it, whether the
lady presented to them was their young mistress or Anne Catherick, of whose
resemblance to her they had all heard, the sad conclusion was inevitable
that the change produced in Lady Glyde's face and manner by her imprisonment
in the Asylum was far more serious than Miss Halcombe had at first supposed.
The vile deception which had asserted her death defied exposure even in
the house where she was born, and among the people with whom she had lived.

<P>In a less critical situation the effort need not have been given up
as hopeless even yet.

<P>For example, the maid, Fanny, who happened to be then absent from Limmeridge,
was expected back in two days, and there would be a chance of gaining her
recognition to start with, seeing that she had been in much more constant
communication with her mistress, and had been much more heartily attached
to her than the other servants. Again, Lady Glyde might have been privately
kept in the house or in the village to wait until her health was a little
recovered and her mind was a little steadied again. When her memory could
be once more trusted to serve her, she would naturally refer to persons
and events in the past with a certainty and a familiarity which no imposter
could simulate, and so the fact of her identity, which her own appearance
had failed to establish, might subsequently be proved, with time to help
her, by the surer test of her own words.

<P>But the circumstances under which she had regained her freedom rendered
all recourse to such means as these simply impracticable. The pursuit from
the Asylum, diverted to Hampshire for the time only, would infallibly next
take the direction of Cumberland. The persons appointed to seek the fugitive
might arrive at Limmeridge House at a few hours' notice, and in Mr Fairlie's
present temper of mind they might count on the immediate exertion of his
local influence and authority to assist them. The commonest consideration
for Lady Glyde's safety forced on Miss Halcombe the necessity of resigning
the struggle to do her justice, and of removing her at once from the place
of all others that was now most dangerous to her -- the neighbourhood of
her own home.

<P>An immediate return to London was the first and wisest measure of security
which suggested itself. In the great city all traces of them might be most
speedily and most surely effaced. There were no preparations to make --
no farewell words of kindness to exchange with any one. On the afternoon
of that memorable day of the sixteenth Miss Halcombe roused her sister
to a last exertion of courage, and without a living soul to wish them well
at parting, the two took their way into the world alone, and turned their
backs for ever on Limmeridge House.

<P>They had passed the hill above the churchyard, when Lady Glyde insisted
on turning back to look her last at her mother's grave. Miss Halcombe tried
to shake her resolution, but, in this one instance, tried in vain. She
was immovable. Her dim eyes lit with a sudden fire, and flashed through
the veil that hung over them -- her wasted fingers strengthened moment
by moment round the friendly arm by which they had held so listlessly till
this time. I believe in my soul that the hand of God was pointing their
way back to them, and that the most innocent and the most afflicted of
His creatures was chosen in that dread moment to see it.

<P>They retraced their steps to the burial-ground, and by that act sealed
the future of our three lives.
<CENTER>
<H2>
III</H2></CENTER>
This was the story of the past -- the story so far as we knew it then.

<P>Two obvious conclusions presented themselves to my mind after hearing
it. In the first place, I saw darkly what the nature of the conspiracy
had been, how chances had been watched, and how circumstances had been
handled to ensure impunity to a daring and an intricate crime. While all
details were still a mystery to me, the vile manner in which the personal
resemblance between the woman in white and Lady Glyde had been turned to
account was clear beyond doubt. It was plain that Anne Catherick had been
introduced into Count Fosco's house as Lady Glyde -- it was plain that
Lady Glyde had taken the dead woman's place in the Asylum -- the substitution
having been so managed as to make innocent people (the doctor and the two
servants certainly, and the owner of the mad-house in all probability)
accomplices in the crime.

<P>The second conclusion came as the necessary consequence of the first.
We three had no mercy to expect from Count Fosco and Sir Percival Glyde.
The success of the conspiracy had brought with it a clear gain to those
two men of thirty thousand pounds -- twenty thousand to one, ten thousand
to the other through his wife. They had that interest, as well as other
interests, in ensuring their impunity from exposure, and they would leave
no stone unturned, no sacrifice unattempted, no treachery untried, to discover
the place in which their victim was concealed, and to part her from the
only friends she had in the world -- Marian Halcombe and myself.

<P>The sense of this serious peril -- a peril which every day and every
hour might bring nearer and nearer to us -- was the one influence that
guided me in fixing the place of our retreat. I chose it in the far east
of London, where there were fewest idle people to lounge and look about
them in the streets. I chose it in a poor and a populous neighbourhood
-- because the harder the struggle for existence among the men and women
about us, the less the risk of their having the time or taking the pains
to notice chance strangers who came among them. These were the great advantages
I looked to, but our locality was a gain to us also in another and a hardly
less important respect. We could live cheaply by the daily work of my hands,
and could save every farthing we possessed to forward the purpose, the
righteous purpose, of redressing an infamous wrong -- which, from first
to last, I now kept steadily in view.

<P>In a week's time Marian Halcombe and I had settled how the course of
our new lives should be directed.

<P>There were no other lodgers in the house, and we had the means of going
in and out without passing through the shop. I arranged, for the present
at least, that neither Marian nor Laura should stir outside the door without
my being with them, and that in my absence from home they should let no
one into their rooms on any pretence whatever. This rule established, I
went to a friend whom I had known in former days -- a wood engraver in
large practice -- to seek for employment, telling him, at the same time,
that I had reasons for wishing to remain unknown.

<P>He at once concluded that I was in debt, expressed his regret in the
usual forms, and then promised to do what he could to assist me. I left
his false impression undisturbed, and accepted the work he had to give.
He knew that he could trust my experience and my industry. I had what he
wanted, steadiness and facility, and though my earnings were but small,
they sufficed for our necessities. As soon as we could feel certain of
this, Marian Halcombe and I put together what we possessed. She had between
two and three hundred pounds left of her own property, and I had nearly
as much remaining from the purchase-money obtained by the sale of my drawing-master's
practice before I left England. Together we made up between us more than
four hundred pounds. l deposited this little fortune in a bank, to be kept
for the expense of those secret inquiries and investigations which I was
determined to set on foot, and to carry on by myself if I could find no
one to help me. We calculated our weekly expenditure to the last farthing,
and we never touched our little fund except in Laura's interests and for
Laura's sake.

<P>The house-work, which, if we had dared trust a stranger near us, would
have been done by a servant, was taken on the first day, taken as her own
right, by Marian Halcombe. `What a woman's hands are fit for,' she said,
`early and late, these hands of mine shall do.' They trembled as she held
them out. The wasted arms told their sad story of the Past, as she turned
up the sleeves of the poor plain dress that she wore for safety's sake;
but the unquenchable spirit of the woman burnt bright in her even yet.
I saw the big tears rise thick in her eyes, and fall slowly over her cheeks
as she looked at me. She dashed them away with a touch of her old energy,
and smiled with a faint reflection of her old good spirits. `Don't doubt
my courage, Walter,' she pleaded, `it's my weakness that cries, not me.
The house-work shall conquer it if I can't.' And she kept her word -- the
victory was won when we met in the evening, and she sat down to rest. Her
large steady black eyes looked at me with a flash of their bright firmness
of bygone days. `I am not quite broken down yet,' she said. `I am worth
trusting with my share of the work.' Before I could answer, she added in
a whisper, `And worth trusting with my share in the risk and the danger
too. Remember that, if the time comes!'

<P>I did remember it when the time came.

<P>As early as the end of October the daily course of our lives had assumed
its settled direction, and we three were as completely isolated in our
place of concealment as if the house we lived in had been a desert island,
and the great network of streets and the thousands of our fellow-creatures
all round us the waters of an illimitable sea. I could now reckon on some
leisure time for considering what my future plan of action should be, and
how I might arm myself most securely at the outset for the coming struggle
with Sir Percival and the Count.

<P>I gave up all hope of appealing to my recognition of Laura, or to Marian's
recognition of her, in proof of her identity. If we had loved her less
dearly, if the instinct implanted in us by that love had not been far more
certain than any exercise of reasoning, far keener than any process of
observation, even we might have hesitated on first seeing her.

<P>The outward changes wrought by the suffering and the terror of the past
had fearfully, almost hopelessly, strengthened the fatal resemblance between
Anne Catherick and herself. In my narrative of events at the time of my
residence in Limmeridge House, I have recorded, from my own observation
of the two, how the likeness, striking as it was when viewed generally,
failed in many important points of similarity when tested in detail. In
those former days, if they had both been seen together side by side, no
person could for a moment have mistaken them one for the other -- as has
happened often in the instances of twins. I could not say this now. The
sorrow and suffering which I had once blamed myself for associating even
by a passing thought with the future of Laura Fairlie, had set their profaning
marks on the youth and beauty of her face; and the fatal resemblance which
I had once seen and shuddered at seeing, in idea only, was now a real and
living resemblance which asserted itself before my own eyes. Strangers,
acquaintances, friends even who could not look at her as we looked, if
she had been shown to them in the first days of her rescue from the Asylum,
might have doubted if she were the Laura Fairlie they had once seen, and
doubted without blame.

<P>The one remaining chance, which I had at first thought might be trusted
to serve us -- the chance of appealing to her recollection of persons and
events with which no imposter could be familiar, was proved, by the sad
test of our later experience, to be hopeless. Every little caution that
Marian and I practised towards her -- every little remedy we tried, to
strengthen and steady slowly the weakened, shaken faculties, was a fresh
protest in itself against the risk of turning her mind back on the troubled
and the terrible past.

<P>The only events of former days which we ventured on encouraging her
to recall were the little trivial domestic events of that happy time at
Limmeridge, when I first went there and taught her to draw. The day when
I roused those remembrances by showing her the sketch of the summer-house
which she had given me on the morning of our farewell, and which had never
been separated from me since, was the birthday of our first hope. Tenderly
and gradually, the memory of the old walks and drives dawned upon her,
and the poor weary pining eyes looked at Marian and at me with a new interest,
with a faltering thoughtfulness in them, which from that moment we cherished
and kept alive. I bought her a little box of colours, and a sketch-book
like the old sketch-book which I had seen in her hands on the morning that
we first met. Once again -- oh me, once again! -- at spare hours saved
from my work, in the dull London light, in the poor London room, I sat
by her side to guide the faltering touch, to help the feeble hand. Day
by day I raised and raised the new interest till its place in the blank
of her existence was at last assured -- till she could think of her drawing
and talk of it, and patiently practise it by herself, with some faint reflection
of the innocent pleasure in my encouragement, the growing enjoyment in
her own progress, which belonged to the lost life and the lost happiness
of past days.

<P>We helped her mind slowly by this simple means, we took her out between
us to walk on fine days, in a quiet old City square near at hand, where
there was nothing to confuse or alarm her -- we spared a few pounds from
the fund at the banker's to get her wine, and the delicate strengthening
food that she required -- we amused her in the evenings with children's
games at cards, with scrapbooks full of prints which I borrowed from the
engraver who employed me -- by these, and other trifling attentions like
them, we composed her and steadied her, and hoped all things, as cheerfully
as we could from time and care, and love that never neglected and never
despaired of her. But to take her mercilessly from seclusion and repose
-- to confront her with strangers, or with acquaintances who were little
better than strangers -- to rouse the painful impressions of her past life
which we had so carefully hushed to rest -- this, even in her own interests,
we dared not do. Whatever sacrifices it cost, whatever long, weary, heart-breaking
delays it involved, the wrong that had been inflicted on her, if mortal
means could grapple it, must be redressed without her knowledge and without
her help.

<P>This resolution settled, it was next necessary to decide how the first
risk should be ventured, and what the first proceedings should be.

<P>After consulting with Marian, I resolved to begin by gathering together
as many facts as could be collected -- then to ask the advice of Mr Kyrle
(whom we knew we could trust), and to ascertain from him, in the first
instance, if the legal remedy lay fairly within our reach. I owed it to
Laura's interests not to stake her whole future on my own unaided exertions,
so long as there was the faintest prospect of strengthening our position
by obtaining reliable assistance of any kind.

<P>The first source of information to which I applied was the journal kept
at Blackwater Park by Marian Halcombe. There were passages in this diary
relating to myself which she thought it best that I should not see. Accordingly,
she read to me from the manuscript, and I took the notes I wanted as she
went on. We could only find time to pursue this occupation by sitting up
late at night. Three nights were devoted to the purpose, and were enough
to put me in possession of all that Marian could tell.

<P>My next proceeding was to gain as much additional evidence as I could
procure from other people without exciting suspicion. I went myself to
Mrs Vesey to ascertain if Laura's impression of having slept there was
correct or not. In this case, from consideration for Mrs Vesey's age and
infinity, and in all subsequent cases of the same kind from considerations
of caution, I kept our real position a secret, and was always careful to
speak of Laura as `the late Lady Glyde'.

<P>Mrs Vesey's answer to my inquiries only confirmed the apprehensions
which I had previously felt. Laura had certainly written to say she would
pass the night under the roof of her old friend -- but she had never been
near the house.

<P>Her mind in this instance, and, as I feared, in other instances besides,
confusedly presented to her something which she had only intended to do
in the false light of something which she had really done. The unconscious
contradiction of herself was easy to account for in this way -- but it
was likely to lead to serious results. It was a stumble on the threshold
at starting -- it was a flaw in the evidence which told fatally against
us.

<P>When I next asked for the letter which Laura had written to Mrs Vesey
from Blackwater Park, it was given to me without the envelope, which had
been thrown into the wastepaper basket, and long since destroyed. In the
letter itself no date was mentioned -- not even the day of the week. It
only contained these lines: -- `Dearest Mrs Vesey, I am in sad distress
and anxiety, and I may come to your house tomorrow night, and ask for a
bed. I can't tell you what is the matter in this letter -- I write it in
such fear of being found out that I can fix my mind on nothing. Pray be
at home to see me. I will give you a thousand kisses, and tell you everything.
Your affectionate Laura.' What help was there in those lines? None.

<P>On returning from Mrs Vesey's, I instructed Marian to write (observing
the same caution which I practised myself) to Mrs Michelson. She was to
express, if she pleased, some general suspicion of Count Fosco's conduct,
and she was to ask the housekeeper to supply us with a plain statement
of events, in the interests of truth. While we were waiting for the answer,
which reached us in a week's time, I went to the doctor in St John's Wood,
introducing myself as sent by Miss Halcombe to collect, if possible, more
particulars of her sister's last illness than Mr Kyrle had found the time
to procure. By Mr Goodricke's assistance, I obtained a copy of the certificate
of death, and an interview with the woman (Jane Gould) who had been employed
to prepare the body for the grave. Through this person I also discovered
a means of communicating with the servant, Hester Pinhorn. She had recently
left her place in consequence of a disagreement with her mistress, and
she was lodging with some people in the neighbourhood whom Mrs Gould knew.
In the manner here indicated I obtained the Narratives of the housekeeper,
of the doctor, of Jane Gould, and of Hester Pinhorn, exactly as they are
presented in these pages.

<P>Furnished with such additional evidence as these documents afforded,
I considered myself to be sufficiently prepared for a consultation with
Mr Kyrle, and Marian wrote accordingly to mention my name to him, and to
specify the day and hour at which I requested to see him on private business.

<P>There was time enough in the morning for me to take Laura out for her
walk as usual, and to see her quietly settled at her drawing afterwards.
She looked up at me with a new anxiety in her face as I rose to leave the
room, and her fingers began to toy doubtfully, in the old way, with the
brushes and pencils on the table.

<P>`You are not tired of me yet?' she said. `You are not going away because
you are tired of me? I will try to do better -- I will try to get well.
Are you as fond of me, Walter, as you used to be, now I am so pale and
thin, and so slow in learning to draw?'

<P>She spoke as a child might have spoken, she showed me her thoughts as
a child might have shown them. I waited a few minutes longer -- waited
to tell her that she was dearer to me now than she had ever been in the
past times. `Try to get well again,' I said, encouraging the new hope in
the future which I saw dawning in her mind, `try to get well again, for
Marian's sake and for mine.'

<P>`Yes,' she said to herself, returning to her drawing. `I must try, because
they are both so fond of me.' She suddenly looked up again. `Don't be gone
long! I can't get on with my drawing, Walter, when you are not here to
help me.'

<P>`I shall soon be back, my darling -- soon be back to see how you are
getting on.'

<P>My voice faltered a little in spite of me. I forced myself from the
room. It was no time, then, for parting with the self-control which might
yet serve me in my need before the day was out.

<P>As I opened the door, I beckoned to Marian to follow me to the stairs.
It was necessary to prepare her for a result which I felt might sooner
or later follow my showing myself openly in the streets.

<P>`I shall, in all probability, be back in a few hours,' I said, `and
you will take care, as usual, to let no one inside the doors in my absence.
But if anything happens --'

<P>`What can happen?' she interposed quickly. `Tell me plainly, Walter,
if there is any danger, and I shall know how to meet it.'

<P>`The only danger,' I replied, `is that Sir Percival Glyde may have been
recalled to London by the news of Laura's escape. You are aware that he
had me watched before I left England, and that he probably knows me by
sight, although I don't know him?'

<P>She laid her hand on my shoulder and looked at me in anxious silence.
I saw she understood the serious risk that threatened us.

<P>`It is not likely,' I said, `that I shall be seen in London again so
soon, either by Sir Percival himself or by the persons in his employ. But
it is barely possible that an accident may happen. In that case, you will
not be alarmed if I fail to return tonight, and you will satisfy any inquiry
of Laura's with the best excuse that you can make for me? If I find the
least reason to suspect that I am watched, I will take good care that no
spy follows me back to this house. Don't doubt my return, Marian, however
it may be delayed -- and fear nothing.'

<P>`Nothing!' she answered firmly. `You shall not regret, Walter, that
you have only a woman to help you.' She paused, and detained me for a moment
longer. `Take care!' she said, pressing my hand anxiously -- `take care!'

<P>I left her, and set forth to pave the way for discovery -- the dark
and doubtful way, which began at the lawyer's door.
