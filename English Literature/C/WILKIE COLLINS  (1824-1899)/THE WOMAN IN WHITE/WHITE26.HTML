Chapter 26</H1></CENTER>
MISS HALCOMBE had never left Blackwater Park!

<P>When I heard that astounding answer, all my thoughts were startled back
on the instant to my parting with Lady Glyde. I can hardly say I reproached
myself, but at that moment I think I would have given many a year's hard
savings to have known four hours earlier what I knew now.

<P>Mrs Rubelle waited, quietly arranging her nosegay, as if she expected
me to say something.

<P>I could say nothing. I thought of Lady Glyde's worn-out energies and
weakly health, and I trembled for the time when the shock of the discovery
that I had made would fall on her. For a minute or more my fears for the
poor ladies silenced me. At the end of that time Mrs Rubelle looked up
sideways from her flowers, and said, `Here is Sir Percival, ma'am, returned
from his ride.'

<P>I saw him as soon as she did. He came towards us, slashing viciously
at the flowers with his riding-whip. When he was near enough to see my
face he stopped, struck at his boot with the whip, and burst out laughing,
so harshly and so violently that the birds flew away, startled, from the
tree by which he stood.

<P>`Well. Mrs Michelson,' he said, `you have found it out at last, have
you?'

<P>I made no reply. He turned to Mrs Rubelle.

<P>`When did you show yourself in the garden?'

<P>`I showed myself about half an hour ago, sir. You said I might take
my liberty again as soon as Lady Glyde had gone away to London.'

<P>`Quite right. I don't blame you I only asked the question.' He waited
a moment, and then addressed himself once more to me. `You can't believe
it, can you?' he said mockingly. `Here! come along and see for yourself.'

<P>He led the way round to the front of the house. I followed him, and
Mrs Rubelle followed me. After passing through the iron gates he stopped,
and pointed with his whip to the disused middle wing of the building.

<P>`There!' he said. `Look up at the first floor. You know the old Elizabethan
bedrooms? Miss Halcombe is snug and safe in one of the best of them at
this moment. Take her in, Mrs Rubelle (you have got your key?); take Mrs
Michelson in, and let her own eyes satisfy her that there is no deception
this time.'

<P>The tone in which he spoke to me. and the minute or two that had passed
since we left the garden. helped me to recover my spirits a little. What
I might have done at this critical moment, if all my life had been passed
in service, I cannot say. As it was, possessing the feelings, the principles,
and the bringing up of a lady, I could not hesitate about the right course
to pursue. My duty to myself, and my duty to Lady Glyde, alike forbade
me to remain in the employment of a man who had shamefully deceived us
both by a series of atrocious falsehoods.

<P>`I must beg permission, Sir Percival, to speak a few words to you in
private,' I said. `Having done so, I shall be ready to proceed with this
person to Miss Halcombe's room.'

<P>Mrs Rubelle, whom I had indicated by a slight turn of my head, insolently
sniffed at her nosegay and walked away, with great deliberation, towards
the house door.

<P>`Well,' said Sir Percival sharply, `what is it now?'

<P>`I wish to mention, sir, that I am desirous of resigning the situation
I now hold at Blackwater Park.' That was literally how l put it. I was
resolved that the first words spoken in his presence should be words which
expressed my intention to leave his service.

<P>He eyed me with one of his blackest looks, and thrust his hands savagely
into the pockets of his riding-coat.

<P>`Why?' he said, `why, I should like to know?'

<P>`It is not for me, Sir Percival, to express an opinion on what has taken
place in this house. I desire to give no offence. I merely with to say
that I do not feel it consistent with my duty to Lady Glyde and to myself
to remain any longer in your service.'

<P>`Is it consistent with your duty to me to stand there, casting suspicion
on me to my face?' he broke out in his most violent manner. `I see what
you're driving at. You have taken your own mean, underhand view of an innocent
deception practised on Lady Glyde for her own good. It was essential to
her health that she should have a. change of air immediately, and you know
as well as I do she would never have gone away if she had been told Miss
Halcombe was still left here. She has been deceived in her own interests
-- and I don't care who knows it. Go, if you like -- there are plenty of
housekeepers as good as you to be had for the asking. Go when you please
-- but take care how you spread scandals about me and my affairs when you're
out of my service. Tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, or it will
be the worse for you! See Miss Halcombe for yourself -- see if she hasn't
been as well taken care of in one part of the house as in the other. Remember
the doctor's own orders that Lady Glyde was to have a change of air at
the earliest possible opportunity. Bear all that well in mind, and then
say anything against me and my proceedings if you dare!'

<P>He poured out these words fiercely, all in a breath, walking backwards
and forwards, and striking about him in the air with his whip.

<P>Nothing that he said or did shook my opinion of the disgraceful series
of falsehoods that he had told in my presence the day before, or of the
cruel deception by which he had separated Lady Glyde from her sister, and
had sent her uselessly to London, when she was half distracted with anxiety
on Miss Halcombe's account. I naturally kept these thoughts to myself,
and said nothing more to irritate him; but I was not the less resolved
to persist in my purpose. A soft answer turneth away wrath, and I suppressed
my own feelings accordingly when it was my turn to reply.

<P>`While I am in your service, Sir Percival,' I said. `I hope I know my
duty well enough not to inquire into your motives. When I am out of your
service, I hope I know my own place well enough not to speak of matters
which don't concern me --'

<P>`When do you want to go?' he asked, interrupting me without ceremony.
`Don't suppose I am anxious to keep you -- don't suppose I care about your
leaving the house. I am perfectly fair and open in this matter, from first
to last. When do you want to go?'

<P>`I should wish to leave at your earliest convenience, Sir Percival-'

<P>`My convenience has nothing to do with it. I shall be out of the house
for good and all tomorrow morning, and I can settle your account tonight.
If you want to study anybody's convenience, it had better be Miss Halcombe's.
Mrs Rubelle's time is up today, and she has reasons for wishing to be in
London tonight. If you go at once, Miss Halcombe won't have a soul left
here to look after her.'

<P>I hope it is unnecessary for me to say that I was quite incapable of
deserting Miss Halcombe in such an emergency as had now befallen Lady Glyde
and herself. After first distinctly ascertaining from Sir Percival that
Mrs Rubelle was certain to leave at once if I took her place, and after
also obtaining permission to arrange for Mr Dawson's resuming his attendance
on his patient, I willingly consented to remain at Blackwater Park until
Miss Halcombe no longer required my services. It was settled that I should
give Sir Percival's solicitor a week's notice before I left, and that he
was to undertake the necessary arrangements for appointing my successor.
The matter was discussed in very few words. At its conclusion Sir Percival
abruptly turned on his heel, and left me free to join Mrs Rubelle. That
singular foreign person had been sitting composedly on the doorstep all
this time, waiting till I could follow her to Miss Halcombe's room.

<P>I had hardly walked half-way towards the house when Sir Percival, who
had withdrawn in the opposite direction, suddenly stopped and called me
back.

<P>`Why are you leaving my service?' he asked.

<P>The question was so extraordinary, after what had just passed between
us, that I hardly knew what to say in answer to it.

<P>`Mind! <I>I</I> don't know why you are going,' he went on. `You must
give a reason for leaving me, I suppose, when you get another situation.
What reason? The breaking up of the family? Is that it?'

<P>`There can be no positive objection, Sir Percival, to that reason --'

<P>`Very well! That's all I want to know. If people apply for your character,
that's your reason, stated by yourself. You go in consequence of the breaking
up of the family.'

<P>He turned away again before I could say another word, and walked out
rapidly into the grounds. His manner was as strange as his language. I
acknowledge he alarmed me.

<P>Even the patience of Mrs Rubelle was getting exhausted, when I joined
her at the house door.

<P>`At last!' she said, with a shrug of her lean foreign shoulders. She
led the way into the inhabited side of the house, ascended the stairs,
and opened with her key the door at the end of the passage, which communicated
with the old Elizabethan rooms -- a door never previously used, in my time,
at Blackwater Park. The rooms themselves I knew well, having entered them
myself on various occasions from the other side of the house. Mrs Rubelle
stopped at the third door along the old gallery, handed me the key of it,
with the key of the door of communication, and told me I should find Miss
Halcombe in that room. Before I went in I thought it desirable to make
her understand that her attendance had ceased. Accordingly, I told her
in plain words that the charge of the sick lady henceforth devolved entirely
on myself.

<P>`I am glad to hear it, ma'am,' said Mrs Rubelle. `I want to go very
much.'

<P>`Do you leave today?' I asked, to make sure of her.

<P>`Now that you have taken charge, ma'am, I leave in half an hour's time.
Sir Percival has kindly placed at my disposition the gardener, and the
chaise, whenever I want them. I shall want them in half an hour's time
to go to the station. I am packed up in anticipation already. I wish you
good-day ma'am.'

<P>She dropped a brisk curtsey, and walked hack along the gallery, humming
a little tune, and keeping time to it cheerfully with the nosegay in her
hand. I am sincerely thankful to say that was the last I saw of Mrs Rubelle.

<P>When I went into the room Miss Halcombe was asleep. I looked at her
anxiously. as she lay in the dismal, high, old-fashioned bed. She was certainly
not in any respect altered for the worse since I had seen her last. She
had not been neglected, I am bound to admit, in any way that I could perceive.
The room was dreary, and dusty, and dark, but the window (looking on a
solitary court-yard at the back of the house) was opened to let in the
fresh air, and all that could be done to make the place comfortable had
been done. The whole cruelty of Sir Percival's deception had fallen on
poor Lady Glyde. The only ill-usage which either he or Mrs Rubelle had
inflicted on Miss Halcombe consisted, as far as I could see, in the first
offence of hiding her away.

<P>I stole back, leaving the sick lady still peacefully asleep. to give
the gardener instructions about bringing the doctor. I begged the man,
after he had taken Mrs Rubelle to the station, to drive round by Mr Dawson's,
and leave a message in my name, asking him to call and see me. I knew he
would come on my account. and I knew he would remain when he found Count
Fosco had left the house.

<P>In due course of time the gardener returned, and said that he had driven
round by Mr Dawson's residence, after leaving Mrs Rubelle at the station.
The doctor sent me word that he was poorly in health himself, but that
he would call, if possible, the next morning.

<P>Having delivered his message the gardener was about to withdraw, but
I stopped him to request that he would come back before dark, and sit up
that night, in one of the empty bedrooms, so as to be within call in case
I wanted him. He understood readily enough my unwillingness to be left
alone all night in the most desolate part of that desolate house, and we
arranged that he should come in between eight and nine.

<P>He came punctually, and I found cause to be thankful that I had adopted
the precaution of calling him in. Before midnight Sir Percival's strange
temper broke out in the most violent and most alarming manner, and if the
gardener had not been on the spot to pacify him on the instant, I am afraid
to think what might have happened.

<P>Almost all the afternoon and evening he had been walking about the house
and grounds in an unsettled, excitable manner, having, in all probability,
as I thought, taken an excessive quantity of wine at his solitary dinner.
However that may be, I heard his voice calling loudly and angrily in the
new wing of the house, as I was taking a turn backwards and forwards along
the gallery the last thing at night. The gardener immediately ran down
to him, and I closed the door of communication, to keep the alarm, if possible,
from reaching Miss Halcombe's ears. It was full half an hour before the
gardener came back. He declared that his master was quite out of his senses
-- not through the excitement of drink, as I had supposed, but through
a kind of panic or frenzy of mind, for which it was impossible to account.
He had found Sir Percival walking backwards and forwards by himself in
the hall, swearing, with every appearance of the most violent passion,
that he would not stop another minute alone in such a dungeon as his own
house, and that he would take the first stage of his journey immediately
in the middle of the night. The gardener, on approaching him, had been
hunted out, with oaths and threats, to get the horse and chaise ready instantly.
In a quarter of an hour Sir Percival had joined him in the yard, had jumped
into the chaise, and, lashing the horse into a gallop, had driven himself
away, with his face as pale as ashes in the moonlight. The gardener had
heard him shouting and cursing at the lodge-keeper to get up and open the
gate -- had heard the wheels roll furiously on again in the still night,
when the gate was unlocked -- and knew no more.

<P>The next day, or a day or two after, I forget which, the chaise was
brought back from Knowlesbury, our nearest town, by the ostler at the old
inn. Sir Percival had stopped there, and had afterwards left by the train
-- for what destination the man could not tell. I never received any further
information, either from himself or from any one else, of Sir Percival's
proceedings, and I am not even aware, at this moment, whether he is in
England or out of it. He and I have not met since he drove away like an
escaped criminal from his own house, and it is my fervent hope and prayer
that we may never meet again.

<P>My own part of this sad family story is now drawing to an end.

<P>I have been informed that the particulars of Miss Halcombe's waking,
and of what passed between us when she found me sitting by her bedside,
are not material to the purpose which is to be answered by the present
narrative. It will be sufficient for me to say in this place, that she
was not herself conscious of the means adopted to remove her from the inhabited
to the uninhabited part of the house. She was in a deep sleep at the time,
whether naturally or artificially produced she could not say. In my absence
at Torquay, and in the absence of all the resident servants except Margaret
Porcher (who was perpetually eating, drinking, or sleeping, when she was
not at work), the secret transfer of Miss Halcombe from one part of the
house to the other was no doubt easily performed. Mrs Rubelle (as I discovered
for myself, in looking about the room) had provisions, and all other necessaries,
together with the means of heating water, broth, and so on, without kindling
a fire, placed at her disposal during the few days of her imprisonment
with the sick lady. She had declined to answer the questions which Miss
Halcombe naturally put, but had not, in other respects, treated her with
unkindness or neglect. The disgrace of lending herself to a vile deception
is the only disgrace with which I can conscientiously charge Mrs Rubelle.

<P>I need write no particulars (and I am relieved to know it) of the effect
produced on Miss Halcombe by the news of Lady Glyde's departure, or by
the far more melancholy tidings which reached us only too soon afterwards
at Blackwater Park. In both cases I prepared her mind beforehand as gently
and as carefully as possible, having the doctor's advice to guide me, in
the last case only, through Mr Dawson's being too unwell to come to the
house for some days after I had sent for him. It was a sad time, a time
which it afflicts me to think of or to write of now. The precious blessings
of religious consolation which I endeavoured to convey were long in reaching
Miss Halcombe's heart, but I hope and believe they came home to her at
last. I never left her till her strength was restored. The train which
took me away from that miserable house was the train which took her away
also. We parted very mournfully in London. I remained with a relative at
Islington, and she went on to Mr Fairlie's house in Cumberland.

<P>I have only a few lines more to write before I close this painful statement.
They are dictated by a sense of duty.

<P>In the first place, I wish to record my own personal conviction that
no blame whatever, in connection with the events which I have now related,
attaches to Count Fosco. I am informed that a dreadful suspicion has been
raised, and that some very serious constructions are placed upon his lordship's
conduct. My persuasion of the Count's innocence remains, however, quite
unshaken. If he assisted Sir Percival in sending me to Torquay, he assisted
under a delusion, for which, as a foreigner and a stranger, he was not
to blame. If he was concerned in bringing Mrs Rubelle to Blackwater Park,
it was his misfortune and not his fault, when that foreign person was base
enough to assist a deception planned and carried out by the master of the
house. I protest, in the interests of morality, against blame being gratuitously
and wantonly attached to the proceedings of the Count.

<P>In the second place, I desire to express my regret at my own inability
to remember the precise day on which Lady Glyde left Blackwater Park for
London. I am told that it is of the last importance to ascertain the exact
date of that lamentable journey, and I have anxiously taxed my memory to
recall it. The effort has been in vain. I can only remember now that it
was towards the latter part of July. We all know the difficulty, after
a lapse of time, of fixing precisely on a past date unless it has been
previously written down. That difficulty is greatly increased in my case
by the alarming and confusing events which took place about the period
of Lady Glyde's departure. I heartily wish I had made a memorandum at the
time. I heartily wish my memory of the date was as vivid as my memory of
that poor lady's face, when it looked at me sorrowfully for the last time
from the carriage window.

THE STORY CONTINUED IN SEVERAL NARRATIVES</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>1. THE NARRATIVE OF HESTER PINHORN, COOK IN THE SERVICE OF COUNT
FOSCO</CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Taken down from her own statement</I></CENTER>


<P>I AM sorry to say that I have never learnt to read or write. I have
been a hard-working woman all my life, and have kept a good character.
I know that it is a sin and wickedness to say the thing which is not, and
I will truly beware of doing so on this occasion. All that I know I will
tell, and I humbly beg the gentleman who takes this down to put my language
right as he goes on, and to make allowances for my being no scholar.

<P>In this last summer I happened to be out of place (through no fault
of my own), and I heard of a situation as plain cook, at Number Five, Forest
Road, St John's Wood. I took the place on trial. My master's name was Fosco.
My mistress was an English lady. He was Count and she was Countess. There
was a girl to do housemaid's work when I got there. She was not over-clean
or tidy, but there was no harm in her. I and she were the only servants
in the house.

<P>Our master and mistress came after we got in; and as soon as they did
come we were told, downstairs, that company was expected from the country.

<P>The company was my mistress's niece, and the back bedroom on the first
floor was got ready for her. My mistress mentioned to me that Lady Glyde
(that was her name) was in poor health, and that I must be particular in
my cooking accordingly. She was to come that day, as well as I can remember
-- but whatever you do, don't trust my memory in the matter. I am sorry
to say it's no use asking me about days of the month, and such-like. Except
Sundays, half my time I take no heed of them, being a hard-working woman
and no scholar. All I know is Lady Glyde came, and when she did come, a
fine fright she gave us all surely. I don't know how master brought her
to the house, being hard at work at the time. But he did bring her in the
afternoon, I think, and the housemaid opened the door to them, and showed
them into the parlour. Before she had been long down in the kitchen again
with me, we heard a hurry-skurry upstairs, and the parlour bell ringing
like mad, and my mistress's voice calling out for help.

<P>We both ran up, and there we saw the lady laid on the sofa, with her
face ghastly white, and her hands fast clenched, and her head drawn down
to one side. She had been taken with a sudden fright, my mistress said,
and master he told us she was in a fit of convulsions. I ran out, knowing
the neighbourhood a little better than the rest of them, to fetch the nearest
doctor's help. The nearest help was at Goodricke's and Garth's, who worked
together as partners, and had a good name and connection, as I have heard,
all round St John's Wood. Mr Goodricke was in, and he came back with me
directly.

<P>It was some time before he could make himself of much use. The poor
unfortunate lady fell out of one fit into another, and went on so till
she was quite wearied out, and as helpless as a new-born babe. We then
got her to bed. Mr Goodricke went away to his house for medicine, and came
hack again in a quarter of an hour or less. Besides the medicine he brought
a bit of hollow mahogany wood with him, shaped like a kind of trumpet,
and after waiting a little while, he put one end over the lady's heart
and the other to his ear, and listened carefully.

<P>When he had done he says to my mistress, who was in the room, `This
is a very serious case,' he says, `I recommend you to write to Lady Glyde's
friends directly.' My mistress says to him, `Is it heart-disease?' And
he says, `Yes, heart-disease of a most dangerous kind.' He told her exactly
what he thought was the matter, which I was not clever enough to understand.
But I know this, he ended by saying that he was afraid neither his help
nor any other doctor's help was likely to be of much service.

<P>My mistress took this ill news more quietly than my master. He was a
big, fat, odd sort of elderly man, who kept birds and white mice, and spoke
to them as if they were so many Christian children. He seemed terribly
cut up by what had happened. `Ah! poor Lady Glyde! poor dear Lady Glyde!'
he says, and went stalking about, wringing his fat hands more like a play-actor
than a gentleman. For one question my mistress asked the doctor about the
lady's chances of getting round, he asked a good fifty at least. I declare
he quite tormented us all, and when he was quiet at last, out he went into
the bit of back garden, picking trumpery little nosegays, and asking me
to take them upstairs and make the sick-room look pretty with them. As
if that did any good. I think he must have been, at times, a little soft
in his head. But he was not a bad master -- he had a monstrous civil tongue
of his own, and a jolly, easy, coaxing way with him. I liked him a deal
better than my mistress. She was a hard one, if ever there was a hard one
yet.

<P>Towards night-time the lady roused up a little. She had been so wearied
out, before that, by the convulsions, that she never stirred hand or foot,
or spoke a word to anybody. She moved in the bed now, and stared about
her at the room and us in it. She must have been a nice-looking lady when
well, with light hair, and blue eyes and all that. Her rest was troubled
at night -- at least so I heard from my mistress, who sat up alone with
her. I only went in once before going to bed to see if I could be of any
use, and then she was talking to herself in a confused, rambling manner.
She seemed to want sadly to speak to somebody who was absent from her somewhere.
I couldn't catch the name the first time, and the second time master knocked
at the door, with his regular mouthful of questions, and another of his
trumpery nosegays.

<P>When I went in early the next morning, the lady was clean worn out again,
and lay in a kind of faint sleep. Mr Goodricke brought his partner, Mr
Garth, with him to advise. They said she must not be disturbed out of her
rest on any account. They asked my mistress many questions, at the other
end of the room, about what the lady's health had been in past times, and
who had attended her, and whether she had ever suffered much and long together
under distress of mind. I remember my mistress said `Yes' to that last
question. And Mr Goodricke looked at Mr Garth, and shook his head; and
Mr Garth looked at Mr Goodricke, and shook his head. They seemed to think
that the distress might have something to do with the mischief at the lady's
heart. She was but a frail thing to look at, poor creature! Very little
strength at any time, I should say -- very little strength.

<P>Later on the same morning, when she woke, the lady took a sudden turn,
and got seemingly a great deal better. I was not let in again to see her,
no more was the housemaid, for the reason that she was not to be disturbed
by strangers. What I heard of her being better was through my master. He
was in wonderful good spirits about the change, and looked in at the kitchen
window from the garden, with his great big curly-brimmed white hat on,
to go out.

<P>`Good Mrs Cook,' says he, `Lady Glyde is better. My mind is more easy
than it was, and I am going out to stretch my legs with a sunny little
summer walk. Shall I order for you, shall I market for you, Mrs Cook? What
are you making there? A nice tart for dinner? Much crust, if you please
-- much crisp crust, my dear, that melts and crumbles delicious in the
mouth.' That was his way. He was past sixty, and fond of pastry. Just think
of that!

<P>The doctor came again in the forenoon, and saw for himself that Lady
Glyde had woke up better. He forbid us to talk to her, or to let her talk
to us, in case she was that way disposed, saying she must be kept quiet
before all things, and encouraged to sleep as much as possible. She did
not seem to want to talk whenever I saw her, except overnight. when I couldn't
make out what she was saying -- she seemed too much worn down. Mr Goodricke
was not nearly in such good spirits about her as master. He said nothing
when he came downstairs, except that he would call again at five o'clock.

<P>About that time (which was before master came home again) the bell rang
hard from the bedroom, and my mistress ran out into the landing, and called
to me to go for Mr Goodricke, and tell him the lady had fainted. I got
on my bonnet and shawl, when, as good luck would have it, the doctor himself
came to the house for his promised visit.

<P>I let him in, and went upstairs along with him. `Lady Glyde was just
as usual,' says my mistress to him at the door; `she was awake, and looking
about her in a strange, forlorn manner, when I heard her give a sort of
half cry, and she fainted in a moment.' The doctor went up to the bed,
and stooped down over the sick lady. He looked very serious, all on a sudden,
at the sight of her, and put his hand on her heart.

<P>My mistress stared hard in Mr Goodricke's face. `Not dead!' says she,
whispering, and turning all of a tremble from head to foot.

<P>`Yes,' says the doctor, very quiet and grave. `Dead. I was afraid it
would happen suddenly when I examined her heart yesterday.' My mistress
stepped back from the bedside while he was speaking, and trembled and trembled
again. `Dead!' she whisPers to herself; `dead so suddenly! dead so soon!
What will the Count say?' Mr Goodricke advised her to go downstairs, and
quiet herself a little. `You have been sitting up all night,' says he,
`and your nerves are shaken. This person,' says he, meaning me, `this person
will stay in the room till I can send for the necessary assistance.' My
mistress did as he told her. `I must prepare the Count,' she says. `I must
carefully prepare the Count.' And so she left us, shaking from head to
foot, and went out.

<P>`Your master is a foreigner,' says Mr Goodricke, when my mistress had
left us. `Does he understand about registering the death?' `I can't rightly
tell, sir,' says I, `but I should think not.' The doctor considered a minute,
and then says he, `I don't usually do such things,' says he, `but it may
save the family trouble in this case if I register the death myself. I
shall pass the district office in half an hour's time, and I can easily
look in. Mention, if you please, that I will do so,' `Yes, sir,' says I,
`with thanks, I'm sure, for your kindness in thinking of it.' `You don't
mind staying here till I can send you the proper person?' says he. `No,
sir,' says I; `I'll stay with the poor lady till then. I suppose nothing
more could be done, sir, than was done?' says I. `No,' says he, `nothing;
she must have suffered sadly before ever I saw her -- the case was hopeless
when I was called in.' `Ah, dear me! we all come to it, sooner or later,
don't we, sir?' says I. He gave no answer to that -- he didn't seem to
care about talking. He said, `Good-day,' and went out.

<P>I stopped by the bedside from that time till the time when Mr Goodricke
sent the person in, as he had promised. She was, by name, Jane Gould. I
considered her to be a respectable-looking woman. She made no remark, except
to say that she understood what was wanted of her, and that she had winded
a many of them in her time.

<P>How master bore the news, when he first heard it, is more than I can
tell, not having been present. When I did see him he looked awfully overcome
by it, to be sure. He sat quiet in a corner, with his fat hands hanging
over his thick knees, and his head down, and his eyes looking at nothing.
He seemed not so much sorry, as scared and dazed like, by what had happened.
My mistress managed all that was to be done about the funeral. It must
have cost a sight of money -- the coffin, in particular, being most beautiful.
The dead lady's husband was away, as we heard, in foreign parts. But my
mistress (being her aunt) settled it with her friends in the country (Cumberland,
I think) that she should be buried there, in the same grave along with
her mother. Everything was done handsomely, in respect of the funeral,
I say again, and master went down to attend the burying in the country
himself. He looked grand in his deep mourning, with his big solemn face,
and his slow walk, and his broad hatband -- that he did!

<P>In conclusion, I have to say, in answer to questions put to me --

<P>(i) That neither I nor my fellow-servant ever saw my master give Lady
Glyde any medicine himself.

<P>(2) That he was never, to my knowledge and belief, left alone in the
room with Lady Glyde.

<P>(3) That I am not able to say what caused the sudden fright, which my
mistress informed me had seized the lady on her first coming into the house.
The cause was never explained, either to me or to my fellow-servant.

<P>The above statement has been read over in my presence. I have nothing
to add to it, or to take away from it. I say, on my oath as a Christian
woman, this is the truth.

3. THE NARRATIVE OF JANE GOULD</H2></CENTER>
I WAS the person sent in by Mr Goodricke to do what was right and needful
by the remains of a lady who had died at the house named in the certificate
which precedes this. I found the body in charge of the servant, Hester
Pinhorn. I remained with it, and prepared it at the proper time for the
grave. It was laid in the coffin in my presence, and I afterwards saw the
coffin screwed down previous to its removal. When that had been done, and
not before, I received what was due to me and left the house. I refer persons
who may wish to investigate my character to Mr Goodricke. He will bear
witness that I can be trusted to tell the truth.

5. THE NARRATIVE OF WALTER HARTRIGHT</H2></CENTER>
EARLY in the summer of 1850 I and my surviving companions left the wilds
and forests of Central America for home. Arrived at the coast, we took
ship there for England. The vessel was wrecked in the Gulf of Mexico --
I was among the few saved from the sea. It was my third escape from peril
of death. Death by disease, death by the Indians, death by drowning --
all three had approached me; all three had passed me by.

<P>The survivors of the wreck were rescued by an American vessel bound
for Liverpool. The ship reached her port on the thirteenth day of October
1850. We landed late in the afternoon, and I arrived in London the same
night.

<P>These pages are not the record of my wanderings and my dangers away
from home. The motives which led me from my country and my friends to a
new world of adventure and peril are known. From that self-imposed exile
I came back, as I had hoped, prayed, believed I should come back -- a changed
man. In the waters of a new life I had tempered my nature afresh. In the
stern school of extremity and danger my will had learnt to be strong, my
heart to be resolute, my mind to rely on itself. I had gone out to fly
from my own future. I came back to face it, as a man should.

<P>To face it with that inevitable suppression of myself which I knew it
would demand from me. I had parted with the worst bitterness of the past,
but not with my heart's remembrance of the sorrow and the tenderness of
that memorable time. I had not ceased to feel the one irreparable disappointment
of my life -- I had only learnt to bear it. Laura Fairlie was in all my
thoughts when the ship bore me away, and I looked my last at England. Laura
Fairlie was in all my thoughts when the ship brought me back, and the morning
light showed the friendly shore in view.

<P>My pen traces the old letters as my heart goes back to the old love.
I write of her as Laura Fairlie still. It is hard to think of her, it is
hard to speak of her, by her husband's name.

<P>There are no more words of explanation to add on my appearing for the
second time in these pages. This narrative, if I have the strength and
the courage to write it, may now go on.

<P>My first anxieties and first hopes when the morning came centred in
my mother and my sister. I felt the necessity of preparing them for the
joy and surprise of my return, after an absence during which it had been
impossible for them to receive any tidings of me for months past. Early
in the morning I sent a letter to the Hampstead Cottage, and followed it
myself in an hour's time.

<P>When the first meeting was over, when our quiet and composure of other
days began gradually to return to us, I saw something in my mother's face
which told me that a secret oppression lay heavy on her heart. There was
more than love -- there was sorrow in the anxious eyes that looked on me
so tenderly -- there was pity in the kind hand that slowly and fondly strengthened
its hold on mine. We had no concealments from each other. She knew how
the hope of my life had been wrecked -- she knew why I had left her. It
was on my lips to ask as composedly as I could if any letter had come for
me from Miss Halcombe, if there was any news of her sister that I might
hear. But when I looked in my mother's face I lost courage to put the question
even in that guarded form. I could only say, doubtingly and restrainedly
--

<P>`You have something to tell me.'

<P>My sister, who had been sitting opposite to us, rose suddenly without
a word of explanation -- rose and left the room.

<P>My mother moved closer to me on the sofa and put her arms round my neck.
Those fond arms trembled -- the tears flowed fast over the faithful loving
face.

<P>`Walter!' she whispered, `my own darling! my heart is heavy for you,
Oh, my son I my son I try to remember that I am still left!'

<P>My head sank on her bosom. She had said all in saying those words.

<P>It was the morning of the third day since my return -- the morning of
the sixteenth of October.

<P>I had remained with them at the cottage -- I had tried hard not to embitter
the happiness of my return to them as it was embittered to <I>me.</I> I
had done all man could to rise after the shock, and accept my life resignedly
-- to let my great sorrow come in tenderness to my heart, and not in despair.
It was useless and hopeless. No tears soothed my aching eyes, no relief
came to me from my sister's sympathy or my mother's love.

<P>On that third morning I opened my heart to them. At last the words passed
my lips which I had longed to speak on the day when my mother told me of
her death.

<P>`Let me go away alone for a little while,' I said. `I shall bear it
better when I have looked once more at the place where I first saw her
-- when I have knelt and prayed by the grave where they have laid her to
rest.'

<P>I departed on my journey -- my journey to the grave of Laura Fairlie.

<P>It was a quiet autumn afternoon when I stopped at the solitary station,
and set forth alone on foot by the well-remembered road. The waning sun
was shining faintly through thin white clouds -- the air was warm and still
-- the peacefulness of the lonely country was overshadowed and saddened
by the influence of the falling year.

<P>I reached the moor -- I stood again on the brow of the hill -- I looked
on along the path -- and there were the familiar garden trees in the distance,
the clear sweeping semicircle of the drive, the high white walls of Limmeridge
House. The chances and changes, the wanderings and dangers of months and
months past, all shrank and shrivelled to nothing in my mind. It was like
yesterday since my feet had last trodden the fragrant heathy ground. I
thought I should see her coming to meet me, with her little straw hat shading
her face, her simple dress fluttering in the air, and her well-filled sketch-book
ready in her hand.

<P>Oh, death, thou hast thy sting! oh, grave, thou hast thy victory!

<P>I turned aside, and there below me in the glen was the lonesome grey
church, the Porch where I had waited for the coming of the woman in white,
the hills encircling the quiet burial-ground, the brook bubbling cold over
its stony bed. There was the marble cross, fair and white, at the head
of the tomb -- the tomb that now rose over mother and daughter alike.

<P>I approached the grave. I crossed once more the low stone stile, and
bared my head as I touched the sacred ground. Sacred to gentleness and
goodness, sacred to reverence and grief.

<P>I stopped before the pedestal from which the cross rose. On one side
of it, on the side nearest to me, the newly-cut inscription met my eyes
-- the hard, clear, cruel black letters which told the story of her life
and death. I tried to read them. I did read as far as the name. `Sacred
to the Memory of Laura --' The kind blue eyes dim with tears -- the fair
head drooping wearily -- the innocent parting words which implored me to
leave her -- oh, for a happier last memory of her than this; the memory
I took away with me, the memory I bring back with me to her grave!

<P>A second time I tried to read the inscription. I saw at the end the
date of her death, and above it --

<P>Above it there were lines on the marble -- there was a name among them
which disturbed my thoughts of her. I went round to the other side of the
grave, where there was nothing to read, nothing of earthly vileness to
force its way between her spirit and mine.

<P>I knelt down by the tomb. I laid my hands, I laid my head on the broad
white stone, and closed my weary eyes on the earth around, on the light
above. I let her come back to me. Oh, my love! my love! my heart may speak
to you now! It is yesterday again since we parted -- yesterday, since your
dear hand lay in mine -- yesterday, since my eyes looked their last on
you. My love! my love!

<P>Time had flowed on, and silence had fallen like thick night over its
course.

<P>The first sound that came after the heavenly peace rustled faintly like
a passing breath of air over the grass of the burial-ground. I heard it
nearing me slowly, until it came changed to my car -- came like footsteps
mowing onward -- then stopped.

<P>I looked up.

<P>The sunset was near at hand. The clouds had parted -- the slanting light
fell mellow over the hills. The last of the day was cold and clear and
still in the quiet valley of the dead.

<P>Beyond me, in the burial-ground, standing together in the cold clearness
of the lower light, I saw two women. They were looking towards the tomb,
looking towards <I>me.</I>

<P>Two.

<P>They came a little on, and stopped again. Their veils were down, and
hid their faces from me. When they stopped one of them raised her veil.
In the still evening light I saw the face of Marian Halcombe.

<P>Changed, changed as if years had passed over it! The eyes large and
wild, and looking at me with a strange terror in them. The face worn and
wasted piteously. Pain and fear and grief written on her as with a brand.

<P>I took one step towards her from the grave. She never moved -- she never
spoke. The veiled woman with her cried out faintly. I stopped. The springs
of my life fell low, and the shuddering of an unutterable dread crept over
me from head to foot.

<P>The woman with the veiled face moved away from her companion, and came
towards me slowly. Left by herself, standing by herself, Marian Halcombe
spoke. It was the voice that I remembered -- the voice not changed, like
the frightened eyes and the wasted face.

<P>`My dream! my dream!' I heard her say those words softly in the awful
silence. She sank on her knees, and raised her clasped hands to heaven.
`Father! strengthen him. Father! help him in his hour of need.'

<P>The woman came on, slowly and silently came on. I looked at her -- at
her, and at none other, from that moment.

<P>The voice that was praying for me faltered and sank low -- then rose
on a sudden, and called affrightedly, called despairingly to me to come
away.

<P>But the veiled woman had possession of me, body and soul. She stopped
on one side of the grave. We stood face to face with the tombstone between
us. She was close to the inscription on the side of the pedestal. Her gown
touched the black letters.

<P>The voice came nearer, and rose and rose more passionately still. `Hide
your face I don't look at her! Oh, for God's sake, spare him --'

<P>The woman lifted her veil.

<P>`Sacred to the Memory of Laura, Lady Glyde --'

<P>Laura, Lady Glyde, was standing by the inscription, and was looking
at me over the grave.
