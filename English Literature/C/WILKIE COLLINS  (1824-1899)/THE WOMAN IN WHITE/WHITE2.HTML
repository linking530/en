`She has escaped from my Asylum!'

<P>I cannot say with truth that the terrible inference which these words
suggested flashed upon me like a new revelation. Some of the strange questions
put to me by the woman in white, after my ill-considered promise to leave
her free to act as she pleased, had suggested the conclusion either that
she was naturally flighty and unsettled, or that some recent shock of terror
had disturbed the balance of her faculties. But the idea of absolute insanity
which we all associate with the very name of an Asylum, had, I can honestly
declare, never occurred to me, in connection with her. I had seen nothing,
in her language or her actions, to justify it at the time; and even with
the new light thrown on her by the words which the stranger had addressed
to the policeman, I could see nothing to justify it now.

<P>What had I done? Assisted the victim of the most horrible of all false
imprisonments to escape; or cast loose on the wide world of London an unfortunate
creature, whose actions it was my duty, and every man's duty, mercifully
to control? I turned sick at heart when the question occurred to me, and
when I felt self-reproachfully that it was asked too late.

<P>In the disturbed state of my mind, it was useless to think of going
to bed, when I at last got back to my chambers in Clement's Inn. Before
many hours elapsed it would be necessary to start on my journey to Cumberland.
I sat down and tried, first to sketch, then to read -- but the woman in
white got between me and my pencil, between me and my book. Had the forlorn
creature come to any harm? That was my first thought, though I shrank selfishly
from confronting it. Other thoughts followed, on which it was less harrowing
to dwell. Where had she stopped the cab? What had become of her now? Had
she been traced and captured by the men in the chaise? Or was she still
capable of controlling her own actions; and were we two following our widely
parted roads towards one point in the mysterious future, at which we were
to meet once more?

<P>It was a relief when the hour came to lock my door, to hid farewell
to London pursuits, London pupils, and London friends, and to be in movement
again towards new interests and a new life. Even the hustle and confusion
at the railway terminus, so wearisome and bewildering at other times, roused
me and did me good.

<P>My travelling instructions directed me to go to Carlisle, and then to
diverge by a branch railway which ran in the direction of the coast. As
a misfortune to begin with, our engine broke down between Lancaster and
Carlisle. The delay occasioned by this accident caused me to be too late
for the branch train, by which I was to have gone on immediately. I had
to wait some hours; and when a later train finally deposited me at the
nearest station to Limmeridge House, it was past ten, and the night was
so dark that I could hardly see my way to the pony-chaise which Mr Fairlie
had ordered to be in waiting for me.

<P>The driver was evidently discomposed by the lateness of my arrival.
He was in that state of highly respectful sulkiness which is peculiar to
English servants. We drove away slowly through the darkness in perfect
silence- The roads were had, and the dense obscurity of the night increased
the difficulty of getting over the ground quickly. It was, by my watch,
nearly an hour and a half from the time of our leaving the station before
I heard the sound of the sea in the distance, and the crunch of our wheels
on a smooth gravel drive. We had passed one gate before entering the drive,
and we passed another before we drew up at the house. I was received by
a solemn man-servant out of livery, was informed that the family had retired
for the night, and was then led into a large and lofty room where my supper
was awaiting me, in a forlorn manner, at one extremity of a lonesome mahogany
wilderness of dining-table.

<P>I was too tired and out of spirits to eat or drink much, especially
with the solemn servant waiting on me as elaborately as if a small dinner
party had arrived at the house instead of a solitary man. In a quarter
of an hour I was ready to be taken up to my bedchamber. The solemn servant
conducted me into a prettily furnished room -- said, `Breakfast at nine
o'clock, sir' -- looked all round him to see that everything was in its
proper place, and noiselessly withdrew.

<P>`What shall I see in my dreams tonight?' I thought to myself, as I put
out the candle; `the woman in white? or the unknown inhabitants of this
Cumberland mansion?' It was a strange sensation to be sleeping in the house,
like a friend of the family, and yet not to know one of the inmates, even
by sight!

When I rose the next morning and drew up my blind, the sea opened before
me joyously under the broad August sunlight, and the distant coast of Scotland
fringed the horizon with its lines of melting blue.

<P>The view was such a surprise, and such a change to me, after my weary
London experience of brick and mortar landscape, that I seemed to burst
into a new life and a new set of thoughts the moment I looked at it. A
confused sensation of having suddenly lost my familiarity with the past,
without acquiring any additional clearness of idea in reference to the
present or the future, took possession of my mind. Circumstances that were
but a few days old faded back in my memory, as if they had happened months
and months since. Pesca's quaint announcement of the means by which he
had procured me my present employment; the farewell evening I had passed
with my mother and sister; even my mysterious adventure on the way home
from Hampstead -- had all become like events which might have occurred
at some former epoch of my existence. Although the woman in white was still
in my mind, the image of her seemed to have grown dull and faint already.

<P>A little before nine o'clock, I descended to the ground-floor of the
house. The solemn man-servant of the night before met me wandering among
the passages, and compassionately showed me the way to the breakfast-room.

<P>My first glance round me, as the man opened the door, disclosed a well-furnished
breakfast-table, standing in the middle of a long room, with many windows
in it. I looked from the table to the window farthest from me, and saw
a lady standing at it, with her back turned towards me. The instant my
eyes rested on her, I was struck by the rare beauty of her form, and by
the unaffected grace of her attitude. Her figure was tall, yet not too
tall; comely and well-developed, yet not fat; her head set on her shoulders
with an easy, pliant firmness; her waist, perfection in the eyes of a man,
for it occupied its natural place, it filled out its natural circle, it
was visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays. She had not heard my
entrance into the room; and I allowed myself the luxury of admiring her
for a few moments, before I moved one of the chairs near me, as the least
embarrassing means of attracting her attention. She turned towards me immediately.
The easy elegance of every movement of her limbs and body as soon as she
began to advance from the far end of the room, set me in a flutter of expectation
to see her face clearly. She left the window -- and I said to myself, The
lady is dark. She moved forward a few steps -- and I said to myself, The
lady is young. She approached nearer -- and I said to myself (with a sense
of surprise which words fail me to express), The lady is ugly!

<P>Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly
contradicted -- never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely
and startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it. The lady's
complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her upper lip was almost
a moustache. She had a large, firm, masculine mouth and jaw; prominent,
piercing, resolute brown eyes; and thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually
low down on her forehead. Her expression -- bright frank, and intelligent
-- appeared, while she was silent, to be altogether wanting in those feminine
attractions of gentleness and pliability, without which the beauty of the
handsomest woman alive is beauty incomplete. To see such a face as this
set on shoulders that a sculptor would have longed to model -- to be charmed
by the modest graces of action through which the symmetrical limbs betrayed
their beauty when they moved, and then to be almost repelled by the masculine
form and masculine look of the features in which the perfectly shaped figure
ended -- was to feel a sensation oddly akin to the helpless discomfort
familiar to us all in sleep, when we recognise yet cannot reconcile the
anomalies and contradictions of a dream.

<P>`Mr Hartright?' said the lady interrogatively, her dark face lighting
up with a smile, and softening and growing womanly the moment she began
to speak. `We resigned all hope of you last night, and went to bed as usual.
Accept my apologies for our apparent want of attention; and allow me to
introduce myself as one of your pupils. Shall we shake hands? I suppose
we must come to it sooner or later -- and why not sooner?'

<P>These odd words of welcome were spoken in a clear, ringing, pleasant
voice. The offered hand -- rather large, but beautifully formed -- was
given to me with the easy, unaffected self-reliance of a highly-bred woman.
We sat down together at the breakfast-table in as cordial and customary
a manner as if we had known each other for years, and had met at Limmeridge
House to talk over old times by previous appointment.

<P>`I hope you come here good-humouredly determined to make the hist of
your position,' continued the lady. `You will have to begin this morning
by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine. My sister is
in her own room, nursing that essentially feminine malady, a slight headache;
and her old governess, Mrs Vesey, is charitably attending on her with restorative
tea. My uncle, Mr Fairlie, never joins us at any of our meals: he is an
invalid, and keeps bachelor state in his own apartments. There is nobody
else in the house but me. Two young ladies have been staying here, but
they went away yesterday, in despair; and no wonder. All through their
visit (in consequence of Mr fairlie's invalid condition) we produced no
such convenience in the house as a flirtable, danceable, small-talkable
creature of the male sex; and the consequence was, we did nothing but quarrel,
especially at dinner-time. How can you expect four women to dine together
alone every day, and not quarrel? We are such fools, we can't entertain
each other at table. You see I don't think much of my own sex, Mr Hartright
-- which will you have, tea or coffee? -- no woman does think much of her
own sex, although few of them confess it as freely as I do. Dear me, you
look puzzled. Why? Are you wondering what you will have for breakfast?
or are you surprised at my careless way of talking? ln the first case,
I advise you, as a friend, to have nothing to do with that cold ham at
your elbow, and to wait till the omelette comes in. In the second case,
I will give you some tea to compose your spirits, and do all a woman can
(which is very little, by-the-bye) to hold my tongue.'

<P>She handed me my cup of tea, laughing gaily. Her light flow of talk,
and her lively familiarity of manner with a total stranger, were accompanied
by an unaffected naturalness and an easy inborn confidence in herself and
her position, which would have secured her the respect of the most audacious
man breathing. While it was impossible to be formal and reserved in her
company, it was more than impossible to take the faintest vestige of a
liberty with her, even in thought. I felt this instinctively, even while
I caught the infection of her own bright gaiety of spirits -- even while
I did my best to answer her in her own frank, lively way.

<P>`Yes, yes,' she said, when I had suggested the only explanation I could
offer, to account for my perplexed looks, `I understand. You are such a
perfect stranger in the house, that you are puzzled by my familiar references
to the worthy inhabitants. Natural enough : I ought to have thought of
it before. At any rate, I can set it right now. Suppose I begin with myself,
so as to get done with that part of the subject as soon as possible? My
name is Marian Halcombe; and I am as inaccurate as women usually are, in
calling Mr fairlie my uncle, and Miss Fairlie my sister. My mother was
twice married: the first time to Mr Halcombe, my father; the second time
to Mr Fairlie, my half-sister's father. Except that we are both orphans,
we are in every respect as unlike each other as possible. My father was
a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's father was a rich man. I have got nothing,
and she has a fortune. I am dark and ugly, and she is fair and pretty.
Everybody thinks me crabbed and odd (with perfect justice); and everybody
thinks her sweet-tempered and charming (with more justice still). In short,
she is an angel; and I am -- Try some of that marmalade, Mr Hartright,
and finish the sentence, in the name of female propriety, for yourself.
What am I to tell you about Mr Fairlie? Upon my honour, I hardly know.
He is sure to send for you after breakfast, and you can study him for yourself.
In the meantime, I may inform you, first, that he is the late Mr Fairlie's
younger brother; secondly, that he is a single man; and thirdly, that he
is Miss Fairlie's guardian. I won't live without her, and she can't live
without me; and that is how I come to be at Limmeridge House. My sister
and I are honestly fond of each other; which, you will say, is perfectly
unaccountable, under the circumstances, and I quite agree with you -- but
so it is. You must please both of us, Mr Hartright, or please neither of
us : and, what is still more trying, you will be thrown entirely upon our
society. Mrs Vesey is an excellent person, who possesses all the cardinal
virtues, and counts for nothing; and Mr Fairlie is too great an invalid
to be a companion for anybody. I don't know what is the matter with him,
and the doctors don't know what is the matter with him, and he doesn't
know himself what is the matter with him. We all say it's on the nerves,
and we none of us know what we mean when we say it. However, I advise you
to humour his little peculiarities, when you see him today. Admire his
collection of coins, prints, and water-colour drawings, and you will win
his heart. Upon my word, if you can be contented with a quiet country life,
I don't see why you should not get on very well here. from breakfast to
lunch, Mr fairlie's drawings will occupy you. After lunch, Miss Fairlie
and I shoulder our sketch-books, and go out to misrepresent Nature, under
your directions. Drawing is her favourite whim, mind, not mine. Women can't
draw -- their minds are too flighty, and their eyes are too inattentive.
No matter -- my sister likes it; so I waste paint and spoil Taper, for
her sake, as composedly as any woman in England. As for the evenings, I
think we can help you through them. Miss Fairlie plays delightfully. For
my own poor part, I don't know one note of music from the other; but I
can match you at chess, backgammon, &eacute;cart&eacute;, and (with the
inevitable female drawbacks) even at billiards as well. What do you think
of the programme? Can you reconcile yourself to our quiet, regular life?
or do you mean to be restless, and secretly thirst for change and adventure,
in the humdrum atmosphere of Limmeridge House?'

<P>She had run on thus far, in her gracefully bantering way, with no other
interruptions on my part than the unimportant replies which politeness
required of me. The turn of the expression, however, in her last question,
or rather the one chance word, `adventure,' lightly as it fell from her
lips, recalled my thoughts to my meeting with the woman in white, and urged
me to discover the connection which the stranger's own reference to Mrs
Fairlie informed me must once have existed between the nameless fugitive
from the Asylum, and the former mistress of Lunmeridge House.

<P>`Even if I were the most restless of mankind,' I said, `I should be
in no danger of thirsting after adventures for some time to come. The very
night before I arrived at this house, I met with an adventure; and the
wonder and excitement of it, I can assure you, Miss Halcombe, will last
me for the whole term of my stay in Cumberland, if not for a much longer
period.'

<P>`You don't say so, Mr Hartright! May I hear it?'

<P>`You have a claim to hear it. The chief person in the adventure was
a total stranger to me, and may perhaps be a total stranger to you; but
she certainly mentioned the name of the late Mrs Fairlie in terms of the
sincerest gratitude and regard.'

<P>`Mentioned my mother's name! You interest me indescribably. Pray go
on.'

<P>I at once related the circumstances under which I had met the woman
in white, exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what she had said
to me about Mrs Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.

<P>Miss Halcombe's bright resolute eyes looked eagerly into mine, from
the beginning of the narrative to the end. Her face expressed vivid interest
and astonishment, but nothing more. She was evidently as far from knowing
of any clue to the mystery as I was myself.

<P>`Are you quite sure of those words referring to my mother?' she asked.

<P>`Quite sure,' I replied. `Whoever she may be, the woman was once at
school in the village of Limmeridge, was treated with especial kindness
by Mrs Fairlie, and, in grateful remembrance of that kindness, feels an
affectionate interest in all surviving members of the family. She knew
that Mrs Fairlie and her husband were both dead; and she spoke of Miss
Fairlie as if they had known each other when they were children.'

<P>`You said, I think, that she denied belonging to this place?'

<P>`Yes, she told me she came from Hampshire.'

<P>`And you entirely failed to find out her name?'

<P>`Entirely.'

<P>`Very strange. I think you were quite justified, Mr Hartright, in giving
the poor creature her liberty, for she seems to have done nothing in your
presence to show herself unfit to enjoy it. But I wish you had been a little
more resolute about finding out her name. We must really clear up this
mystery, in some way. You had better not speak of it yet to Mr Fairlie,
or to my sister. They are both of them, I am certain, quite as ignorant
of who the woman is, and of what her past history in connection with us
can be, as I am myself. But they are also, in widely different ways, rather
nervous and sensitive; and you would only fidget one and alarm the other
to no purpose. As for myself, I am all aflame with curiosity, and I devote
my whole energies to the business of discovery from this moment. When my
mother came here, after her second marriage, she certainly established
the village school just as it exists at the present time. But the old teachers
are all dead, or gone elsewhere: and no enlightenment is to be hoped for
from that quarter. The only other alternative I can think of --'

<P>At this point we were interrupted by the entrance of the servant, with
a message from Mr Fairlie, intimating that he would be glad to see me,
as soon as I had done breakfast.

<P>`Wait in the hall,' said Miss Halcombe, answering the servant for me,
in her quick, ready way. `Mr Hartright will come out directly. I was about
to say,' she went on, addressing me again, `that my sister and I have a
large collection of my mother's letters, addressed to my father and to
hers. In the absence of any other means of getting information, I will
pass the morning in looking over my mother's correspondence with Mr Fairlie.
He was fond of London, and was constantly away from his country home; and
she was accustomed, at such times, to write and report to him how things
went on at Limmeridge. Her letters are full of references to the school
in which she took so strong an interest; and I think it more than likely
that I may have discovered something when we meet again. The luncheon hour
is two, Mr Hartright. I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to my
sister by that time, and we will occupy the afternoon in driving round
the neighbourhood and showing you all our pet points of view. Till two
o'clock, then, farewell.'

<P>She nodded to me with the lively grace, the delightful refinement of
familiarity, which characterised all that She did and all that she said;
and disappeared by a door at the lower end of the room. As soon as she
had left me, I turned my steps towards the hall, and followed the servant,
on my way, for the first time, to the presence of Mr Fairlie.
<CENTER>
<H2>
IV</H2></CENTER>
My conductor led me upstairs into a passage which took us back to the bedchamber
in which I had slept during the past night; and opening the door next to
it, begged me to look in.

<P>`I have my master's orders to show you your own sitting-room, sir,'
said the man, `and to inquire if you approve of the situation and the light.'

<P>I must have been hard to please, indeed, if I had not approved of the
room, and of everything about it. The bow-window looked out on the same
lovely view which I had admired, in the morning, from my bedroom. The furniture
was the perfection of luxury and beauty; the table in the centre was bright
with gaily bound books, elegant conveniences for writing, and beautiful
flowers; the second table, near the window, was covered with all the necessary
materials for mounting water-colour drawings, and had a little easel attached
to it, which I could expand or fold up at will; the walls were hung with
gaily tinted chintz; and the floor was spread with Indian matting in maize-colour
and red. It was the prettiest and most luxurious little sitting-room I
had ever seen; and I admired it with the warmest enthusiasm.

<P>The solemn servant was far too highly trained to betray the slightest
satisfaction. He bowed with icy deference when my terms of eulogy were
all exhausted, and silently opened the door for me to go out into the passage
again.

<P>We turned a corner, and entered a long second passage, ascended a short
flight of stairs at the end, crossed a small circular upper hall, and stopped
in front of a door covered with dark baize. The servant opened this door,
and led me on a few yards to a second; opened that also, and disclosed
two curtains of pale sea-green silk hanging before us; raised one of them
noiselessly; softly uttered the words, `Mr Hartright,' and left me.

<P>I found myself in a large, lofty room, with a magnificent carved ceiling,
and with a carpet over the floor, so thick and soft that it felt like piles
of velvet under my feet. One side of the room was occupied by a long bookcase
of some rare inlaid wood that was quite new to me. It was not more than
six feet high, and the top was adorned with statuettes in marble, ranged
at regular distances one from the other. On the opposite side stood two
antique cabinets; and between them, and above them, hung a picture of the
Virgin and Child, protected by glass, and bearing Raphael's name on the
gilt tablet at the bottom of the frame. On my right hand and on my left,
as I stood inside the door, were chiffoniers and little stands in buhl
and marquetterie, loaded with figures in Dresden china, with rare vases,
ivory ornaments, and toys and curiosities that sparkled at all points with
gold, silver, and precious stones. At the lower end of the room, opposite
to me, the windows were concealed and the sunlight was tempered by large
blinds of the same pale sea-green colour as the curtains over the door.
The light thus produced was deliciously soft, mysterious, and subdued;
it fell equally upon all the objects in the room; it helped to intensify
the deep silence, and the air of profound seclusion that possessed the
place; and it surrounded, with an appropriate halo of repose, the solitary
figure of the master of the house, leaning back, listlessly composed, in
a large easy-chair, with a reading-easel fastened on one of its arms, and
a little table on the other.

<P>If a man's personal appearance, when he is out of his dressing-room,
and when he has passed forty, can be accepted as a safe guide to his time
of life -- which is more than doubtful -- Mr Fairlie's age, when I saw
him, might have been reasonably computed at over fifty and under sixty
years. His beardless face was thin, worn, and transparently pale, but not
wrinkled; his nose was high and hooked; his eyes were of a dim greyish
blue, large, prominent, and rather red round the rims of the eyelids; his
hair was scanty, soft to look at, and of that light sandy colour which
is the last to disclose its own changes towards grey. He was dressed in
a dark frock-coat, of some substance much thinner than cloth, and in waistcoat
and trousers of spotless white. His feet were effeminately small, and were
clad in buff-coloured silk stockings, and little womanish bronze-leather
slippers. Two rings adorned his white delicate hands, the value of which
even my inexperienced observation detected to be all but priceless. Upon
the whole, he had a frail, languidly-fretful, over-refined look -- something
singularly and unpleasantly delicate in its association with a man, and,
at the same time, something which could by no possibility have looked natural
and appropriate if it had been transferred to the personal appearance of
a woman. My morning's experience of Miss Halcombe had predisposed me to
be pleased with everybody in the house; but my sympathies shut themselves
up resolutely at the first sight of Mr Fairlie.

<P>On approaching nearer to him, I discovered that he was not so entirely
without occupation as I had at first supposed. Placed amid the other rare
and beautiful objects on a large round table near him, was a dwarf cabinet
in ebony and silver, containing coins of all shapes and sizes, set out
in little drawers lined with dark purple velvet. One of these drawers lay
on the small table attached to his chair; and near it were some tiny jeweller's
brushes, a wash-leather `stump,' and a little bottle of liquid, all waiting
to be used in various ways for the removal of any accidental impurities
which might be discovered on the coins. His frail white fingers were listlessly
toying with something which looked, to my uninstructed eyes, like a dirty
pewter medal with ragged edges, when I advanced within a respectful distance
of his chair, and stopped to make my bow.

<P>`So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr Hartright,' he said in a querulous,
croaking voice, which combined, in anything but an agreeable manner, a
discordantly high tone with a drowsily languid utterance. `Pray sit down.
And don't trouble yourself to move the chair, please. In the wretched state
of my nerves, movement of any kind is exquisitely painful to me. Have you
seen your studio? Will it do?'

<P>`I have just come from seeing the room, Mr Fairlie; and I assure you
--'

<P>He stopped me in the middle of the sentence, by closing his eyes, and
holding up one of his white hands imploringly. I paused in astonishment;
and the croaking voice honoured me with this explanation --

<P>`Pray excuse me. But <I>could you</I> contrive to speak in a lower key?
In the wretched state of my nerves, loud sound of any kind is indescribable
torture to me. You will pardon an invalid? I only say to you what the lamentable
state of my health obliges me to say to everybody. Yes. And you really
like the room?'

<P>`I could wish for nothing prettier and nothing more comfortable,' I
answered, dropping my voice, and beginning to discover already that Mr
Fairlie's selfish affectation and Mr Fairlie's wretched nerves meant one
and the same thing.

<P>`So glad. You will find your position here, Mr Hartright, properly recognised.
There is none of the horrid English barbarity of feeling about the social
position of an artist in this house. So much of my early life has been
passed abroad, that I have quite cast my insular skin in that respect.
I wish I could say the same of the gentry -- detestable word, but I suppose
I must use it -- of the gentry in the neighbourhood. They are sad Goths
in Art, Mr Hartright. People, I do assure you, who would have opened their
eyes in astonishment, if they had seen Charles the fifth pick up Titian's
brush for him. Do you mind putting this tray of coins back in the cabinet,
and giving me the next one to it? In the wretched state of my nerves, exertion
of any kind is unspeakably disagreeable to me. Yes. Thank you.'

<P>As a practical commentary on the liberal social theory which he had
just favoured me by illustrating, Mr Fairlie's cool request rather amused
me. I put back one drawer and gave him the other, with all possible politeness.
He began trifling with the new set of coins and the little brushes immediately;
languidly looking at them and admiring them all the time he was speaking
to me.

<P>`A thousand thanks and a thousand excuses. Do you like coins? Yes. So
glad we have another taste in common besides our taste for Art. Now, about
the pecuniary arrangements between us -- do tell me -- are they satisfactory?'

<P>`Most satisfactory, Mr Fairlie.'

<P>`So glad. And -- what next? Ah! I remember. Yes. In reference to the
consideration which you are good enough to accept for giving me the benefit
of your accomplishments in art, my steward will wait on you at the end
of the fist week, to ascertain your wishes. And -- what next? Curious,
is it not? I had a great deal more to say: and I appear to have quite forgotten
it. Do you mind touching the bell? In that corner. Yes. Thank you.'

<P>I rang; and a new servant noiselessly made his appearance -- a foreigner,
with a set smile and perfectly brushed hair -- a valet every inch of him.

<P>`Louis,' said Mr Fairlie, dreamily dusting the tips of his fingers with
one of the tiny brushes for the coins, `I made some entries in my tablettes
this morning. Find my tablettes. A thousand pardons, Mr Hartright, I'm
afraid I bore you.'

<P>As he wearily closed his eyes again, before I could answer, and as he
did most assuredly bore me, I sat silent, and looked up at the Madonna
and Child by Raphael. In the meantime, the valet left the room, and returned
shortly with a little ivory book. Mr Fairlie, after first relieving himself
by a gentle sigh, let the book drop open with one hand, and held up the
tiny brush with the other, as a sign to the servant to wait for further
orders.

<P>`Yes. rust so!' said Mr Fairlie, consulting the tablettes. `Louis, take
down that portfolio.' He pointed, as he spoke, to several portfolios placed
near the window, on mahogany stands. `No. Not the one with the green back
-- that contains my Rembrandt etchings, Mr Hartright. Do you like etchings?
Yes? So glad we have another taste in common. The portfolio with the red
back, Louis. Don't drop it! You have no idea of the tortures I should suffer,
Mr Hartright, if Louis dropped that portfolio, Is it safe on the chair?
Do you think it safe, Mr Hartright? Yes? So glad. Will you oblige me by
looking at the drawings, if you really think they are quite safe. Louis,
go away. What an ass you are. Don't you see me holding the tablettes? Do
you suppose I want to hold them? Then why not relieve me of the tablettes
without being told? A thousand pardons, Mr Hartright; servants are such
asses, are they not? Do tell me -- what do you think of the drawings? They
have come from a sale in a shocking state -- I thought they smelt of horrid
dealers' and brokers' fingers when I looked at them last. Can you undertake
them?'

<P>Although my nerves were not delicate enough to detect the odour of plebeian
fingers which had offended Mr Fairlie's nostrils, my taste was sufficiently
educated to enable me to appreciate the value of the drawings, while I
turned them over. They were, for the most part, really fine specimens of
English water-colour art; and they had deserved much better treatment at
the hands of their former possessor than they appeared to have received.

<P>`The drawings,' I answered, `require careful straining and mounting;
and, in my opinion, they are well worth --'

<P>`I beg your pardon,' interposed Mr Fairlie. `Do you mind my closing
my eyes while you speak? Even this light is too much for them. Yes?'

<P>`l was about to say that the drawings are well worth all the time and
trouble --'

<P>Mr Fairlie suddenly opened his eyes again, and rolled them with an expression
of helpless alarm in the direction of the window.

<P>`I entreat you to excuse me, Mr Hartright,' he said in a feeble flutter.
`But surely I hear some horrid children in the garden -- my private garden
-- below?'

<P>`I can't say, Mr Fairlie. I heard nothing myself.'

<P>`Oblige me -- you have been so very good in humouring my poor nerves
-- oblige me by lifting up a corner of the blind. Don't let the sun in
on me, Mr Hartright! Have you got the blind up? Yes? Then will you be so
very kind as to look into the garden and make quite sure?'

<P>I complied with this new request. The garden was carefully walled in,
all round. Not a human creature, large or small, appeared in any part of
the sacred seclusion. I reported that gratifying fact to Mr Fairlie.

<P>`A thousand thanks. My fancy, I suppose. There are no children, thank
Heaven, in the house; but the servants (persons born without nerves) will
encourage the children from the village. Such brats -- oh, dear me, such
brats! Shall I confess it, Mr Hartright? -- I sadly want a reform in the
construction of children. Nature's only idea seems to be to make them machines
for the production of incessant noise. Surely our delightful Raffaello's
conception is infinitely preferable?'

<P>He pointed to the picture of the Madonna, the upper part of which represented
the conventional cherubs of Italian Art, celestially Provided with sitting
accommodation for their chins, on balloons of buff-coloured cloud.

<P>`Quite a model family!' said Mr Fairlie, leering at the cherubs. `Such
nice round faces, and such nice soft wings, and -- nothing else. No dirty
little legs to run about on, and no noisy little lungs to scream with.
How immeasurably superior to the existing construction! I will close my
eyes again, if you will allow me. And you really can manage the drawings?
So glad. Is there anything else to settle? if there is, I think I have
forgotten it. Shall we ring for Louis again?'

<P>Being, by this time, quite as anxious, on my side, as Mr Fairlie evidently
was on his, to bring the interview to a speedy conclusion, I thought I
would try to render the summoning of the servant unnecessary, by offering
the requisite suggestion on my own responsibility.

<P>`The only point, Mr Fairlie, that remains to be discussed,' I said,
`refers, I think, to the instruction in sketching which I am engaged to
communicate to the two young ladies.'

<P>`Ah! just so,' said Mr Fairlie. `I wish I felt strong enough to go into
that part of the arrangement -- but I don't. The ladies who profit by your
kind services, Mr Hartright, must settle, and decide, and so on, for themselves.
My niece is fond of your charming art. She knows just enough about it to
be conscious of her own sad defects. Please take pains with her. Yes. Is
there anything else? No. We quite understand each other -- don't we? I
have no right to detain you any longer from your delightful pursuit --
have I? So pleasant to have settled everything -- such a sensible relief
to have done business. Do you mind ringing for Louis to carry the portfolio
to your own room?'

<P>`I will carry it there myself, Mr Fairlie, if you will allow me.'

<P>`Will you really? Are you strong enough? How nice to be so strong I
Are you sure you won't drop it? So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr
Hartright. I am such a sufferer that I hardly dare hope to enjoy much of
your society. Would you mind taking great pains not to let the doors bang,
and not to drop the portfolio? Thank you. Gently with the curtains, please
-- the slightest noise from them goes through me like a knife. Yes. Good
morning!'

<P>When the sea-green curtains were closed, and when the two baize doors
were shut behind me, I stopped for a moment in the little circular hall
beyond, and drew a long, luxurious breath of relief. It was like coming
to the surface of the water after deep diving, to find myself once more
on the outside of Mr Fairlie's room.

<P>As soon as I was comfortably established for the morning in my pretty
little studio, the first resolution at which I arrived was to turn my steps
no more in the direction of the apartments occupied by the master of the
house, except in the very improbable event of his honouring me with a special
invitation to pay him another visit. Having settled this satisfactory plan
of future conduct in reference to Mr Fairlie, I soon recovered the serenity
of temper of which my employer's haughty familiarity and impudent politeness
had, for the moment, deprived me. The remaining hours of the morning passed
away pleasantly enough, in looking over the drawings, arranging them in
sets, trimming their ragged edges, and accomplishing the other necessary
preparations in anticipation of the business of mounting them. I ought,
perhaps, to have made more progress than this; but, as the luncheon-time
drew near, I grew restless and unsettled, and felt unable to fix my attention
on work, even though that work was only of the humble manual kind.

<P>At two o'clock I descended again to the breakfast-room, a little anxiously.
Expectations of some interest were connected with my approaching reappearance
in that part of the house. My introduction to Miss Fairlie was now close
at hand; and, if Miss Halcombe's search through her mother's letters had
produced the result which she anticipated, the time had come for clearing
up the mystery of the woman in white.
