Chapter 25</H1></CENTER>
The next event that occurred was of so singular a nature that it might
have caused me a feeling of superstitious surprise, if my mind had not
been fortified by principle against any pagan weakness of that sort. The
uneasy sense of something wrong in the family which had made me wish myself
away from Blackwater Park, was actually followed, strange to say, by my
departure from the house. It is true that my absence was for a temporary
period only, but the coincidence was, in my opinion, not the less remarkable
on that account.

<P>My departure took place under the following circumstances --

<P>A day or two after the servants all left I was again sent for to see
Sir Percival. The undeserved slur which he had cast on my management of
the household did not, I am happy to say, prevent me from returning good
for evil to the best of my ability, by complying with his request as readily
and respectfully as ever. It cost me a struggle with that fallen nature,
which we all share in common, before I could suppress my feelings. Being
accustomed to self-discipline, I accomplished the sacrifice. I found Sir
Percival and Count Fosco sitting together again. On this occasion his lordship
remained present at the interview, and assisted in the development of Sir
Percival's views. The subject to which they now requested my attention
related to the healthy change of air by which we all hoped that Miss Halcombe
and Lady Glyde might soon be enabled to profit. Sir Percival mentioned
that both the ladies would probably pass the autumn (by invitation of Frederick
Fairlie, Esquire) at Limmeridge House, Cumberland. But before they went
there, it was his opinion, confirmed by Count Fosco (who here took up the
conversation and continued it to the end). that they would benefit by a
short residence first in the genial climate of Torquay. The great object,
therefore, was to engage lodgings at that place, affording all the comforts
and advantages of which they stood in need, and the great difficulty was
to find an experienced person capable of choosing the sort of residence
which they wanted. In this emergency the Count begged to inquire, on Sir
Percival's behalf, whether I would object to give the ladies the benefit
of my assistance, by proceeding myself to Torquay in their interests. It
was impossible for a person in my situation to meet any proposal, made
in these terms, with a positive objection. I could only venture to represent
the serious inconvenience of my leaving Blackwater Park in the extraordinary
absence of all the indoor servants, with the one exception of Margaret
Porcher. But Sir Percival and his lordship declared that they were both
willing to put up with inconvenience for the sake of the invalids. I next
respectfully suggested writing to an agent at Torquay, but I was met here
by being reminded of the imprudence of taking lodgings without first seeing
them. I was also informed that the Countess (who would otherwise have gone
to Devonshire herself) could not, in Lady Glyde's present condition, leave
her niece, and that Sir Percival and the Count had business to transact
together which would oblige them to remain at Blackwater Park. In short,
it was clearly shown me that if I did not undertake the errand, no one
else could be trusted with it. Under these circumstances, I could only
inform Sir Percival that my services were at the disposal of Miss Halcombe
and Lady Glyde.

<P>It was thereupon arranged that I should leave the next morning, that
I should occupy one or two days in examining all the most convenient houses
in Torquay, and that I should return with my report as soon as I conveniently
could. A memorandum was written for me by his lordship, stating the requisites
which the place I was sent to take must be found to possess, and a note
of the pecuniary limit assigned to me was added by Sir Percival.

<P>My own idea on reading over these instructions was, that no such residence
as I saw described could be found at any watering-place in England, and
that, even if it could by chance be discovered, it would certainly not
be parted with for any period on such terms as I was permitted to offer.
I hinted at these difficulties to both the gentlemen, but Sir Percival
(who undertook to answer me) did not appear to feel them. It was not for
me to dispute the question. I said no more, but I felt a very strong conviction
that the business on which I was sent away was so beset by difficulties
that my errand was almost hopeless at starting.

<P>Before I left I took care to satisfy myself that Miss Halcombe was going
on favourably.

<P>There was a painful expression of anxiety in her face which made me
fear that her mind, on first recovering itself, was not at ease. But she
was certainly strengthening more rapidly than I could have ventured to
anticipate, and she was able to send kind messages to Lady Glyde, saying
that she was fast getting well, and entreating her ladyship not to exert
herself again too soon. I left her in charge of Mrs Rubelle, who was still
as quietly independent of every one else in the house as ever. When I knocked
at Lady Glyde's door before going away, I was told that she was still sadly
weak and depressed, my informant being the Countess, who was then keeping
her company in her room. Sir Percival and the Count were walking on the
road to the lodge as I was driven by in the chaise. I bowed to them and
quitted the house, with not a living soul left in the servants' offices
but Margaret Porcher.

<P>Every. one must feel what I have felt myself since that time, almost
suspicious. Let me, however, say again that it was impossible for me, in
my dependent position, to act otherwise than I did.

<P>The result of my errand at Torquay was exactly what I had fore-seen.
No such lodgings as I was instructed to take could be found in the whole
place, and the terms I was permitted to give were much too low for the
purpose, even if I had been able to discover what I wanted. I accordingly
returned to Blackwater Park, and informed Sir Percival, who met me at the
door, that my journey had been taken in vain. He seemed too much occupied
with some other subject to care about the failure of my errand, and his
first words informed me that even in the short time of my absence another
remarkable change had taken place in the house.

<P>The Count and Countess Fosco had left Blackwater Park for their new
residence in St John's Wood.

<P>I was not made aware of the motive for this sudden departure -- I was
only told that the Count had been very particular in leaving his kind compliments
to me. When I ventured on asking Sir Percival whether Lady Glyde had any
one to attend to her comforts in the absence of the Countess, he replied
that she had Margaret Porcher to wait on her, and he added that a woman
from the village had been sent for to do the work downstairs.

<P>The answer really shocked me -- there was such a glaring impropriety
in permitting an under-housemaid to fill the place of confidential attendant
on Lady Glyde. I went upstairs at once, and met Margaret on the bedroom
landing. Her services had not been required (naturally enough), her mistress
having sufficiently recovered that morning to be able to leave her bed.
I asked next after Miss Halcombe, but I was answered in a slouching, sulky
way, which left me no wiser than I was before. I did not choose to repeat
the question, and perhaps provoke an impertinent reply. It was in every
respect more becoming to a person in my position to present myself immediately
in Lady Glyde's room.

<P>I found that her ladyship had certainly gained in health during the
last few days. Although still sadly weak and nervous, she was able to get
up without assistance, and to walk slowly about her room, feeling no worse
effect from the exertion than a slight sensation of fatigue. She had been
made a little anxious that morning about Miss Halcombe, through having
received no news of her from any one. I thought this seemed to imply a
blamable want of attention on the part of Mrs Rubelle, but I said nothing,
and remained with Lady Glyde to assist her to dress. When she was ready
we both left the room together to go to Miss Halcombe.

<P>We were stopped in the passage by the appearance of Sir Percival. He
looked as if he had been purposely waiting there to see us.

<P>`Where are you going?' he said to Lady Glyde.

<P>`To Marian's room,' she answered.

<P>`It may spare you a disappointment,' remarked Sir Percival, `if I tell
you at once that you will not find her there.'

<P>`Not find her there!'

<P>`No. She left the house yesterday morning with Fosco and his wife.'

<P>Lady Glyde was not strong enough to bear the surprise of this extraordinary
statement. She turned fearfully pale, and leaned back against the wall,
looking at her husband in dead silence.

<P>I was so astonished myself that I hardly knew what to say. I asked Sir
Percival if he really meant that Miss Halcombe had left Blackwater Park.

<P>`I certainly mean it,' he answered.

<P>`In her state, Sir Percival! Without mentioning her intentions to Lady
Glyde!'

<P>Before he could reply her ladyship recovered herself a little and spoke.

<P>`Impossible!' she cried out in a loud, frightened manner, taking a step
or two forward from the wall. `Where was the doctor? where was Mr Dawson
when Marian went away?'

<P>`Mr Dawson wasn't wanted, and wasn't here,' said Sir Percival. `He left
of his own accord, which is enough of itself to show that she was strong
enough to travel. How you stare! If you don't believe she has gone, look
for yourself. Open her room door, and all the other room doors if you like.'

<P>She took him at his word, and I followed her. There was no one in Miss
Halcombe's room but Margaret Porcher, who was busy setting it to rights.
There was no one in the spare rooms or the dressing-rooms when we looked
into them afterwards. Sir Percival still waited for us in the passage.
As we were leaving the last room that we had examined Lady Glyde whispered,
`Don't go, Mrs Michelson! don't leave me, for God's sake!' Before I could
say anything in return she was out again in the passage, speaking to her
husband.

<P>`What does it mean, Sir Percival? I insist -- I beg and pray you will
tell me what it means.'

<P>`It means,' he answered, `that Miss Halcombe was strong enough yesterday
morning to sit up and be dressed, and that she insisted on taking advantage
of Fosco's going to London to go there too.'

<P>`To London!'

<P>`Yes -- on her way to Limmeridge.'

<P>Lady Glyde turned and appealed to me.

<P>`You saw Miss Halcombe last,' she said. `Tell me plainly, Mrs Michelson,
did you think she looked fit to travel?'

<P>`Not in my opinion, your ladyship.'

<P>Sir Percival, on his side, instantly turned and appealed to me also.

<P>`Before you went away,' he said, `did you, or did you not, tell the
nurse that Miss Halcombe looked much stronger and better?'

<P>`I certainly made the remark, Sir Percival.'

<P>He addressed her ladyship again the moment I offered that reply.

<P>`Set one of Mrs Michelson's opinions fairly against the other,' he said,
`and try to be reasonable about a perfectly plain matter. If she had not
been well enough to be moved do you think we should any of us have risked
letting her go? She has got three competent people to look after her --
Fosco and your aunt, and Mrs Rubelle, who went away with them expressly
for that purpose. They took a whole carriage yesterday, and made a bed
for her on the seat in case she felt tired. Today, Fosco and Mrs Rubelle
go on with her themselves to Cumberland --'

<P>`Why does Marian go to Limmeridge and leave me here by myself?' said
her ladyship, interrupting Sir Percival.

<P>`Because your uncle won't receive you till he has seen your sister first,'
he replied. `Have you forgotten the letter he wrote to her at the beginning
of her illness? It was shown to you, you read it yourself, and you ought
to remember it.'

<P>`I do remember it.'

<P>`If you do, why should you be surPrised at her leaving you? You want
to be back at Limmeridge, and she has gone there to get your uncle's leave
for you on his own terms.'

<P>Poor Lady Glyde's eyes filled with tears.

<P>`Marian never left me before,' she said, `without bidding me good-bye.'

<P>`She would have bid you good-bye this time,' returned Sir Percival,
`if she had not been afraid of herself and of you. She knew you would try
to stop her, she knew you would distress her by crying. Do you want to
make any more objections? If you do, you must come downstairs and ask questions
in the dining-room. These worries upset me. I want a glass of wine.'

<P>He left us suddenly.

<P>His manner all through this strange conversation had been very unlike
what it usually was- He seemed to be almost as nervous and fluttered, every
now and then, as his lady herself. I should never have supposed that his
health had been so delicate, or his composure so easy to upset.

<P>I tried to prevail on Lady Glyde to go back to her room, but it was
useless. She stopped in the passage, with the look of a woman whose mind
was panic-stricken.

<P>`Something has happened to my sister!' she said.

<P>`Remember, my lady, what surprising energy there is in Miss Halcombe,'
I suggested. `She might well make an effort which other ladies in her situation
would be unfit for. I hope and believe there is nothing wrong -- I do indeed.'

<P>`I must follow Marian,' said her ladyship, with the same panic-stricken
look. `I must go where she has gone, I must see that she is alive and well
with my own eyes. Come! come down with me to Sir Percival.'

<P>I hesitated, fearing that my presence might be considered an intrusion.
I attempted to represent this to her ladyship, but she was deaf to me.
She held my arm fast enough to force me to go downstairs with her, and
she still clung to me with all the little strength she had at the moment
when I opened the dining-room door.

<P>Sir Percival was sitting at the table with a decanter of wine before
him. He raised the glass to his lips as we went in and drained it at a
draught. Seeing that he looked at me angrily when he put it down again,
I attempted to make some apology for my

<P>accidental presence in the room.

<P>`Do you suppose there are any secrets going on here?' he broke out suddenly;
`there are none -- there is nothing underhand, nothing kept from you or
from any one.' After speaking those strange words loudly and sternly, he
filled himself another glass of wine and asked Lady Glyde what she wanted
of him.

<P>`If my sister is St to travel I am fit to travel,' said her ladyship,
with more firmness than she had yet shown. `I come to beg you will make
allowances for my anxiety about Marian, and let me follow her at once by
the afternoon train.'

<P>`You must wait till tomorrow,' replied Sir Percival, `and then if you
don't hear to the contrary you can go. I don't suppose you are at all likely
to hear to the contrary, so I shall write to Fosco by tonight's post.'

<P>He said those last words holding his glass up to the light, and looking
at the wine in it instead of at Lady Glyde. Indeed he never once looked
at her throughout the conversation. Such a singular want of good breeding
in a gentleman of his rank impressed me, I own, very painfully.

<P>`Why should you write to Count Fosco?' she asked, in extreme surprise.

<P>`To tell him to expect you by the midday train,' said Sir Percival.
`He will meet you at the station when you get to London, and take you on
to sleep at your aunt's in St John's Wood.'

<P>Lady Glyde's hand began to tremble violently round my arm -- why I could
not imagine.

<P>`There is no necessity for Count Fosco to meet me,' she said. `I would
rather not stay in London to sleep.'

<P>`You must. You can't take the whole journey to Cumberland in one day.
You must rest a night in London -- and I don't choose you to go by yourself
to an hotel. Fosco made the offer to your uncle to give you house-room
on the way down, and your uncle has accepted. Here! here is a letter from
him addressed to yourself. I ought to have sent it up this morning, but
I forgot. Read it and see what Mr Fairlie himself says to you.'

<P>Lady Glyde looked at the letter for a moment and then placed it in my
hands.

<P>`Read it,' she said faintly. `I don't know what is the matter with me.
I can't read it myself.'

<P>It was a note of only four lines -- so short and so careless that it
quite struck me. If I remember correctly it contained no more than these
words --

<P>`Dearest Laura, Please come whenever you like. Break the journey by
sleeping at your aunt's house. Grieved to hear of dear Marian's illness.
Affectionately yours, Frederick Fairlie.'

<P>`I would rather not go there -- I would rather not stay a night in London,'
said her ladyship, breaking out eagerly with those words before I had quite
done reading the note, short as it was. `Don't write to Count Fosco! Pray,
pray don't write to him!'

<P>Sir Percival filled another glass from the decanter so awkwardly that
he upset it and spilt all the wine over the table. `My sight seems to be
failing me,' he muttered to himself, in an odd, muffled voice. He slowly
set the glass up again, refilled it, and drained it once more at a draught.
I began to fear, from his look and manner, that the wine was getting into
his head.

<P>`Pray don't write to Count Fosco,' persisted Lady Glyde, more earnestly
than ever.

<P>`Why not, I should like to know?' cried Sir Percival, with a sudden
burst of anger that startled us both. `Where can you stay more properly
in London than at the place your uncle himself chooses for you -- at your
aunt's house? Ask Mrs Michelson.

<P>The arrangement proposed was so unquestionably the right and the proper
one, that I could make no possible objection to it. Much as I sympathised
with Lady Glyde in other respects, I could not sympathise with her in her
unjust prejudices against Count Fosco. I never before met with any lady
of her rank and station who was so lamentably narrow-minded on the subject
of foreigners. Neither her uncle's note nor Sir Percival's increasing impatience
seemed to have the least effect on her. She still objected to staying a
night in London, she still implored her husband not to write to the Count.

<P>`Drop it!' said Sir Percival, rudely turning his back on us. `If you
haven't sense enough to know what is best for yourself other people must
know for you. The arrangement is made, and there is an end of it. You are
only wanted to do what Miss Halcombe has done before you --'

<P>`Marian?' repeated her ladyship, in a bewildered manner; `Marian sleeping
in Count Fosco's house!'

<P>`Yes, in Count Fosco's house. She slept there last night to break the
journey, and you are to follow her example, and do what your uncle tells
you. You are to sleep at Fosco's tomorrow night, as your sister did, to
break the journey. Don't throw too many obstacles in my way! don't make
me repent of letting you go at all!'

<P>He started to his feet, and suddenly walked out into the verandah through
the open glass doors.

<P>`Will your ladyship excuse me,' I whispered, `if I suggest that we had
better not wait here till Sir Percival comes back? I am very much afraid
he is over-excited with wine.'

<P>She consented to leave the room in a weary, absent manner.

<P>As soon as we were safe upstairs again, I did all I could to compose
her ladyship's spirits. I reminded her that Mr Fairlie's letters to Miss
Halcombe and to herself did certainly sanction, and even render necessary,
sooner or later, the course that had been taken. She agreed to this, and
even admitted, of her own accord, that both letters were strictly in character
with her uncle's peculiar disposition -- but her fears about Miss Halcombe,
and her unaccountable dread of sleeping at the Count's house in London,
still remained unshaken in spite of every consideration that I could urge.
I thought it my duty to protest against Lady Glyde's unfavourable opinion
of his lordship, and I did so, with becoming forbearance and respect.

<P>`Your ladyship will pardon my freedom,' I remarked, in conclusion, `but
it is said, ``by their fruits ye shall know them.'' I am sure the Count's
constant kindness and constant attention, from the very beginning of Miss
Halcombe's illness, merit our best confidence and esteem. Even his lordship's
serious misunderstanding with Mr Dawson was entirely attributable to his
anxiety on Miss Halcombe's account.'

<P>`What misunderstanding?' inquired her ladyship, with a look of sudden
interest.

<P>I related the unhappy circumstances under which Mr Dawson had withdrawn
his attendance -- mentioning them all the more readily because I disapproved
of Sir Percival's continuing to conceal what had happened (as he had done
in my presence) from the knowledge of Lady Glyde.

<P>Her ladyship started up, with every appearance of being additionally
agitated and alarmed by what I had told her.

<P>`Worse! worse than I thought!' she said, walking about the room, in
a bewildered manner. `The Count knew Mr Dawson would never consent to Marian's
taking a journey -- he purposely insulted the doctor to get him out of
the house.'

<P>`Oh, my lady! my lady!' I remonstrated.

<P>`Mrs Michelson!' she went on vehemently, `no words that ever were spoken
will persuade me that my sister is in that man's power and in that man's
house with her own consent- My horror of him is such, that nothing Sir
Percival could say, and no letters my uncle could write, would induce me,
if I had only my own feelings to consult, to eat, drink, or sleep under
his roof. But my misery of suspense about Marian gives me the courage to
follow her anywhere, to follow her even into Count Fosco's house.'

<P>I thought it right, at this point, to mention that Miss Halcombe had
already gone on to Cumberland, according to Sir Percival's account of the
matter.

<P>`I am afraid to believe it!' answered her ladyship. `I am afraid she
is still in that man's house. If I am wrong, if she has really gone to
Limmeridge I am resolved I will not sleep tomorrow night under Count Fosco's
roof. My dearest friend in the world, next to my sister, lives near London.
You have heard me, you have heard Miss Halcombe, speak of Mrs Vesey? I
mean to write, and propose to sleep at her house. I don't know how I shall
get there -- I don't know how I shall avoid the Count -- but to that refuge
I will escape in some way, if my sister has gone to Cumberland. All I ask
of you to do, is to see yourself that my letter to Mrs Vesey goes to London
tonight, as certainly as Sir Percival's letter goes to Count Fosco. I have
reasons for not trusting the post-bag downstairs. Will you keep my secret,
and help me in this? it is the last favour, perhaps, that I shall ever
ask of you.'

<P>I hesitated, I thought it all very strange, I almost feared that her
ladyship's mind had been a little affected by recent anxiety and suffering.
At my own risk, however, I ended by giving my consent. If the letter had
been addressed to a stranger, or to any one but a lady so well known to
me by report as Mrs Vesey, I might have refused. I thank God -- looking
to what happened afterwards -- I thank God I never thwarted that wish,
or any other, which Lady Glyde expressed to me, on the last day of her
residence at Blackwater Park.

<P>The letter was written and given into my hands. I myself put it into
the post-box in the village that evening.

<P>We saw nothing more of Sir Percival for the rest of the day.

<P>I slept, by Lady Glyde's own desire, in the next room to hers, with
the door open between us. There was something so strange and dreadful in
the loneliness and emptiness of the house, that I was glad, on my side,
to have a companion near me. Her ladyship sat up late, reading letters
and burning them, and emptying her drawers and cabinets of little things
she prized, as if she never expected to return to Blackwater Park. Her
sleep was sadly disturbed when she at last went to bed -- she cried out
in it several times, once so loud that she woke herself. Whatever her dreams
were, she did not think fit to communicate them to me. Perhaps, in my situation,
I had no right to expect that she should do so. It matters little now.
I was sorry for her, I was indeed heartily sorry for her all the same.

<P>The next day was fine and sunny. Sir Percival came up, after breakfast,
to tell us that the chaise would be at the door at a quarter to twelve
-- the train to London stopping at our station at twenty minutes after.
He informed Lady Glyde that he was obliged to go out, but added that he
hoped to be back before she left. If any unforeseen accident delayed him,
I was to accompany her to the station, and to take special care that she
was in time for the train. Sir Percival communicated these directions very
hastily -- walking here and there about the room all the time. Her ladyship
looked attentively after him wherever he went. He never once looked at
her in return.

<P>She only spoke when he had done, and then she stopped him as he approached
the door, by holding out her hand.

<P>`I shall see you no more,' she said. in a very marked manner. `This
is our parting -- our parting, it may be for ever. Will you try to forgive
me, Percival, as heartily as I forgive <I>you</I>?'

<P>His face turned of an awful whiteness all over, and great beads of perspiration
broke out on his bald forehead. `I shall come back,' he said, and made
for the door, as hastily as if his wife's farewell words had frightened
him out of the room.

<P>I had never liked Sir Percival, but the manner in which he left Lady
Glyde made me feel ashamed of having eaten his bread and lived in his service.
I thought of saying a few comforting and Christian words to the poor lady,
but there was something in her face, as she looked after her husband when
the door closed on him, that made me alter my mind and keep silence

<P>At the time named the chaise drew up at the gates. Her ladyship was
right -- Sir Percival never came back. I waited for him till the last moment,
and waited in vain.

<P>No positive responsibility lay on my shoulders, and yet I did not feel
easy in my mind. `It is of your own free will,' I said, as the chaise drove
through the lodge-gates, `that your ladyship goes to London?'

<P>`I will go anywhere,' she answered, `to end the dreadful suspense that
I am suffering at this moment.'

<P>She had made me feel almost as anxious and as uncertain about Miss Halcombe
as she felt herself. I presumed to ask her to write me a line, if all went
well in London. She answered, `Most willingly, Mrs Michelson.'

<P>`We all have our crosses to bear, my lady,' I said, seeing her silent
and thoughtful, after she had promised to write.

<P>She made no reply -- she seemed to be too much wrapped up in her own
thoughts to attend to me.

<P>`I fear your ladyship rested badly last night,' I remarked, after waiting
a little.

<P>`Yes,' she said, I was terribly disturbed by dreams.'

<P>`Indeed, my lady?' I thought she was going to tell me her dreams, but
no, when she spoke next it was only to ask a question.

<P>`You posted the letter to Mrs Vesey with your own hands?'

<P>`Yes, my Lady.'

<P>`Did Sir Percival say, yesterday, that Count Fosco was to meet me at
the terminus in London?'

<P>`He did, my lady.'

<P>She sighed heavily when I answered that last question, and said no more.

<P>We arrived at the station, with hardly two minutes to spare. The gardener
(who had driven us) managed about the luggage, while I took the ticket.
The whistle of the train was sounding when I joined her ladyship on the
platform. She looked very strangely, and pressed her hand over her heart,
as if some sudden pain or fright had overcome her at that moment.

<P>`I wish you were going with me!' she said, catching eagerly at my arm
when I gave her the ticket.

<P>If there had been time, if I had felt the day before as I felt then,
I would have made my arrangements to accompany her, even though the doing
so had obliged me to give Sir Percival warning on the spot. As it was,
her wishes, expressed at the last moment only, were expressed too late
for me to comply with them. She seemed to understand this herself before
I could explain it, and did not repeat her desire to have me for a travelling
companion. The train drew up at the platform. She gave the gardener a present
for his children, and took my hand, in her simple hearty manner, before
she got into the carriage.

<P>`You have been very kind to me and to my sister,' she said -- `kind
when we were both friendless. I shall remember you gratefully, as long
as I live to remember any one. Good-bye -- and God bless you!'

<P>She spoke those words with a tone and a look which brought the tears
into my eyes -- she spoke them as if she was bidding me farewell for ever.

<P>`Good-bye, my lady,' I said, putting her into the carriage, and trying
to cheer her; `good-bye, for the present only; good-bye, with my best and
kindest wishes for happier times.'

<P>She shook her head, and shuddered as she settled herself in the carriage.
The guard closed the door. `Do you believe in dreams?' she whispered to
me at the window. `My dreams, last night, were dreams I have never had
before. The terror of them is hanging over me still.' The whistle sounded
before I could answer, and the train moved. Her pale quiet face looked
at me for the last time -- looked sorrowfully and solemnly from the window.
She waved her hand, and I saw her no more.

<P>Towards five o'clock on the afternoon of that same day, having a little
time to myself in the midst of the household duties which now pressed upon
me, I sat down alone in my own room, to try and compose my mind with the
volume of my husband's Sermons. For the first time in my life I found my
attention wandering over those pious and cheering words. Concluding that
Lady Glyde's departure must have disturbed me far more seriously than I
had myself supposed, I put the book aside, and went out to take a turn
in the garden. Sir Percival had not yet returned, to my knowledge, so I
could feel no hesitation about showing myself in the grounds.

<P>On turning the corner of the house, and gaining a view of the garden,
I was startled by seeing a stranger walking in it. The stranger was a woman
-- she was lounging along the path with her hack to me. and was gathering
the flowers.

<P>As I approached she heard me, and turned round.

<P>My blood curdled in my veins. The strange woman in the garden was Mrs
Rubelle!

<P>I could neither more nor speak. She came up to me, as composedly as
ever, with her flowers in her hand.

<P>`What is the matter, ma'am?' she said quietly.

<P>`You here!' I gasped out. `Not gone to London! Not gone to Cumberland!'

<P>Mrs Rubelle smelt at her flowers with a smile of malicious pity.

<P>`Certainly not,' she said. `I have never left Blackwater Park.'

<P>I summoned breath enough and courage enough for another question.

<P>`Where is Miss Halcombe?'

<P>Mrs Rubelle fairly laughed at me this time, and replied in these words
--

<P>`Miss Halcombe, ma'am, has not left Blackwater Park either.'
