Concerning Politics

Said I:"How do you manage with politics?"

Said Hammond, smiling: "I am glad that it is of _me_that you ask that
question; I do believe that anybody else would make you explain
yourself, or try to do so, till you were sick of asking questions.
Indeed, I believe I am the only man in England who would know what you
mean; and since I know, I will answer your question briefly by saying
that we are very well off as to politiics,--because we have none. If
ever you make a book out4 of this conversation, put this in a chapter
by itself, after the model of old Horrebow's Snakes in Iceland."

"I will," said I.
