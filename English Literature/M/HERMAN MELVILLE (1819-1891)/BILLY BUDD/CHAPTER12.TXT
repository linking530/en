                   Lawyers, Experts, Clergy

                          AN EPISODE



    By the way, can it be the phenomenon, disowned or at least

concealed, that in some criminal cases puzzles the courts? For this

cause have our juries at times not only to endure the prolonged

contentions of lawyers with their fees, but also the yet more

perplexing strife of the medical experts with theirs?- But why leave

it to them? Why not subpoena as well the clerical proficients? Their

vocation bringing them into peculiar contact with so many human

beings, and sometimes in their least guarded hour, in interviews

very much more confidential than those of physician and patient;

this would seem to qualify them to know something about those

intricacies involved in the question of moral responsibility;

whether in a given case, say, the crime proceeded from mania in the

brain or rabies of the heart. As to any differences among themselves

these clerical proficients might develop on the stand, these could

hardly be greater than the direct contradictions exchanged between the

remunerated medical experts.

    Dark sayings are these, some will say. But why? Is it because they

somewhat savor of Holy Writ in its phrase "mysteries of iniquity"?

If they do, such savor was far from being intended, for little will it

commend these pages to many a reader of to-day.

    The point of the present story turning on the hidden nature of the

Master-at-arms has necessitated this chapter. With an added hint or

two in connection with the incident at the mess, the resumed narrative

must be left to vindicate, as it may, its own credibility.
