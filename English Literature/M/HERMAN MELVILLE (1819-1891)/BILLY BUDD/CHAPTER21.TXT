    Full of disquietude and misgiving the Surgeon left the cabin.

Was Captain Vere suddenly affected in his mind, or was it but a

transient excitement, brought about by so strange and extraordinary

a happening? As to the drum-head court, it struck the Surgeon as

impolitic, if nothing more. The thing to do, he thought, was to

place Billy Budd in confinement and in a way dictated by usage, and

postpone further action in so extraordinary a case to such time as

they should rejoin the squadron, and then refer it to the Admiral.

He recalled the unwonted agitation of Captain Vere and his excited

exclamations so at variance with his normal manner. Was he unhinged?

But assuming that he is, it is not so susceptible of proof. What

then can he do? No more trying situation is conceivable than that of

an officer subordinate under a Captain whom he suspects to be, not mad

indeed, but yet not quite unaffected in his intellect. To argue his

order to him would be insolence. To resist him would be mutiny.

    In obedience to Captain Vere he communicated what had happened

to the lieutenants and Captain of Marines; saying nothing as to the

Captain's state. They fully shared his own surprise and concern.

Like him too they seemed to think that such a matter should be

referred to the Admiral.
