<H2>
Tom Is Expected</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>IT was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to
go with her father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the Academy;
but the morning was too wet, Mrs Tulliver said, for a little girl to go
out in her best bonnet. Maggie took the opposite view very strongly, and
it was a direct consequence of this difference of opinion, that when her
mother was in the act of brushing out the reluctant black crop, Maggie
suddenly rushed from under her hands and dipped her head in a basin of
water standing near, - in the vindictive determination that there should
be no more chance of curls that day. `Maggie, Maggie,' exclaimed Mrs Tulliver,
sitting stout and helpless with the brushes on her lap, `what is to become
of you, if you're so naughty? I'll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet
when they come next week, and they'll never love you any more. O dear,
O dear, look at your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom. Folks 'ull
think it's a judgment on me as I've got such a child - they'll think I've
done summat wicked.'

<P>Before this remonstrance was finished Maggie was already out of hearing,
making her way towards the great attic that ran under the old high-pitched
roof, shaking the water from her black locks as she ran, like a Skye terrier
escaped from his bath. This attic was Maggie's favourite retreat on a wet
day, when the weather was not too cold: here she fretted out all her ill-humours,
and talked aloud to the worm-eaten floors and the worm-eaten shelves and
the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs, and here she kept a Fetish which
she punished for all her misfortunes. This was the trunk of a large wooden
doll, which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of
cheeks, but was now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering.
Three nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie's
nine years of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been suggested
to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old Bible. The last
nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual, for the Fetish
on that occasion represented aunt Glegg. But immediately afterwards Maggie
had reflected that if she drove many nails in, she would not be so well
able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall,
nor to comfort it, and make believe to poultice it when her fury was abated;
for even aunt Glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much,
and thoroughly humiliated, so as to beg her niece's pardon. Since then,
she had driven no more nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately
grinding and beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great
chimneys that made two square pillars supporting the roof. That was what
she did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with
a passion that expelled every other form of consciousness - even the memory
of the grievance that had caused it. As at last the sobs were getting quieter
and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of sunshine, falling through
the wire lattice across the worm-eaten shelves, made her throw away the
Fetish and run to the window. The sun was really breaking out, the sound
of the mill seemed cheerful again, the granary doors were open, and there
was Yap, the queer white and brown terrier with one ear turned back, trotting
about and sniffing vaguely as if he were in search of a companion. It was
irresistible: Maggie tossed her hair back and ran downstairs, seized her
bonnet without putting it on, peeped and then dashed along the passage
lest she should encounter her mother, and was quickly out in the yard,
whirling round like a Pythoness and singing as she whirled, `Yap, Yap,
Tom's coming home', while Yap pranced and barked round her, as much as
to say, if there was any noise wanted, he was the dog for it.

<P>`Hegh, hegh, Miss, you'll make yourself giddy an' tumble down i' the
dirt,' said Luke, the head miller, a tall broad-shouldered man of forty,
black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a general mealiness, like an auricula.

<P>Maggie paused in her whirling and said, staggering a little, `O no,
it doesn't make me giddy. Luke, may I go into the mill with you?'

<P>Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came
out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark
eyes flash out with new fire. The resolute din, the unresting motion of
the great stones giving her a dim delicious awe as at the presence of an
uncontrollable force, the meal for ever pouring, pouring, the fine white
powder softening all surfaces and making the very spider-nets look like
faery lace-work, the sweet pure scent of the meal - all helped to make
Maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from her outside everyday
life. The spiders were especially a subject of speculation with her: she
wondered if they had any relations outside the mill, for in that case there
must be a painful difficulty in their family intercourse: a fat and floury
spider, accustomed to take his fly well dusted with meal, must suffer a
little at a cousin's table where the fly was <I>au naturel</I>, and the
lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other's appearance. But the
part of the mill she liked best was the topmost story - the corn-hutch
where there were the great heaps of grain which she could sit on and slide
down continually. She was in the habit of taking this recreation as she
conversed with Luke, to whom she was very communicative, wishing him to
think well of her understanding, as her father did.

<P>Perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the
present occasion, for, as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near which
he was busying himself, she said, at that shrill pitch which was requisite
in mill-society,

<P>`I think you never read any book but the Bible, did you, Luke?'

<P>`Nay, Miss - an' not much o' that,' said Luke, with great frankness.
`I'm no reader, I arn't.'

<P>`But if I lent you one of my books, Luke? I've not got any <I>very</I>
pretty books that would be easy for you to read; but there's "Pug's Tour
of Europe" - that would tell you all about the different sorts of people
in the world, and if you didn't understand the reading, the pictures would
help you - they show the looks and ways of the people and what they do.
There are the Dutchmen, very fat, and smoking, you know - and one sitting
on a barrel.'

<P>`Nay, Miss, I'n no opinion o' Dutchmen. There ben't much good i' knowin'
about <I>them</I>.'

<P>`But they're our fellow-creatures, Luke - we ought to know about our
fellow-creatures.'

<P>`Not much o' fellow-creaturs, I think, Miss: all I know - my old master,
as war a knowin' man, used to say, says he, `If e'er I sow my wheat wi'out
brinin', I'm a Dutchman,' says he; an' that war as much as to say as a
Dutchman war a fool, or next door. Nay, nay, I arn't goin' to bother mysen
about Dutchmen. There's fools enoo - an' rogues enoo - wi'out lookin' i'
books for 'em.'

<P>`O well,' said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke's unexpectedly decided
views about Dutchmen, `perhaps you would like "Animated Nature" better
- that's not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants, and kangaroos, and the
civet cat, and the sun-fish, and a bird sitting on its tail - I forget
its name. There are countries full of those creatures, instead of horses
and cows, you know. Shouldn't you like to know about them, Luke?'

<P>`Nay, Miss, I'n got to keep 'count o' the flour an' corn - I can't do
wi' knowin' so many things besides my work. That's what brings folk to
the gallows - knowin' everything but what they'n got to get their bread
by. An' they're mostly lies, I think, what's printed i' the books: them
printed sheets are, anyhow, as the men cry i' the streets.'

<P>`Why you're like my brother Tom, Luke,' said Maggie, wishing to turn
the conversation agreeably, `Tom's not fond of reading. I love Tom so dearly,
Luke - better than any-body else in the world. When he grows up, I shall
keep his house, and we shall always live together. I can tell him everything
he doesn't know. But I think Tom's clever, for all he doesn't like books:
he makes beautiful whip-cord and rabbit-pens.'

<P>`Ah,' said Luke, `but he'll be fine an' vexed as the rabbits are all
dead.'

<P>`Dead!' screamed Maggie, jumping up from her sliding seat on the corn.
`O, dear Luke! What, the lop-eared one, and the spotted doe, that Tom spent
all his money to buy?'

<P>`As dead as moles,' said Luke, fetching his comparison from the unmistakable
corpses nailed to the stable wall.

<P>`O dear Luke,' said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big tears rolled
down her cheek, `Tom told me to take care of'em, and I forgot. What <I>shall</I>
I do?'

<P>`Well, you see, Miss, they war in that far toolhouse, an'it was nobody's
business to see to 'em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to feed 'em, but
there's no countin' on Harry - <I>he's</I> a offal creatur as iver come
about the primises, he is. He remembers nothin' but his own inside - an'
I wish it 'ud gripe him.'

<P>`O Luke, Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day -
but how could I, when they did not come into my head, you know? O, he will
be so angry with me, I know he will, and so sorry about his rabbits - and
so am I sorry. O what <I>shall</I> I do?'

<P>`Don't you fret, Miss,' said Luke, soothingly, `they're nash things,
them lop-eared rabbits - they'd happen ha'died, if they'd been fed. Things
out o' natur niver thrive. God A'mighty doesn't like 'em. He made the rabbits'
ears to lie back, an' it's nothin' but contrairiness to make 'em hing down
like a mastiff dog's. Master Tom 'ull know better nor buy such things another
time. Don't you fret, Miss. Will you come along home wi' me, and see my
wife? I'm agoin' this minute.'

<P>The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie's grief, and
her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke's side to his
pleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and with the
added dignity of a lean-to pig-sty, close by the brink of the Ripple. Mrs
Moggs, Luke's wife, was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance: she exhibited
her hospitality in bread and treacle and possessed various works of art.
Maggie actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning,
as she stood on a chair to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing
the Prodigal Son in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that,
as might have been expected from his defective moral character, he had
not, like that accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense
with a wig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her
mind caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak
young man, particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned
against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned
and his wig awry, while the swine, apparently of some foreign breed, seemed
to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks.

<P>`I'm very glad his father took him back again aren't you, Luke?' she
said. `For he was very sorry, you know, and wouldn't do wrong again.'

<P>`Eh, Miss,' said Luke, `he'd be no great shakes, I doubt, let's feyther
do what he would for him.'

<P>That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the subsequent
history of the young man had not been left a blank.
