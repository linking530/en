Confidential Moments</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>WHEN Maggie went up to her bedroom that night it appeared that she
was not all inclined to undress. She set down her candle on the first table
that presented itself, and began to walk up and down her room, which was
a large one, with a firm, regular and rather rapid step, which showed that
the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong excitement. Her eyes and
cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy; her head was thrown backward
and her hands were clasped with the palms outward and with that tension
of the arms which is apt to accompany mental absorption. Had anything remarkable
happened?

<P>Nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree unimportant.
She had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass voice - but then
it was sung in a provincial amateur fashion, such as would have left your
critical ear much to desire. And she was conscious of having been looked
at a great deal in rather a furtive manner from beneath a pair of well-marked
horizontal eyebrows, with a glance that seemed somehow to have caught the
vibratory influence of the voice. Such things could have had no perceptible
effect on a thoroughly well-educated young lady with a perfectly balanced
mind, who had had all the advantages of fortune, training and refined society.
But if Maggie had been that young lady, you would probably have known nothing
about her; her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could hardly
have been written; for the happiest women, like the happiest nations, have
no history.

<P>In poor Maggie's highly strung, hungry nature - just come away from
a third rate schoolroom, with all its jarring sounds and petty round of
tasks - these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and exalting
her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself. It was not that
she thought distinctly of Mr Stephen Guest or dwelt on the indications
that he looked at her with admiration; it was rather that she felt the
half-remote presence of a world of love and beauty and delight, made up
of vague, mingled images from all the poetry and romance she had ever read,
or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries. Her mind glanced back once or
twice to the time when she had courted privation, when she had thought
all longing, all impatience was subdued, but that condition seemed irrecoverably
gone, and she recoiled from the remembrance of it. No prayer, no striving
now would bring back that negative peace: the battle of her life, it seemed,
was not to be decided in that short and easy way - by perfect renunciation
at the very threshold of her youth. The music was vibrating in her still
- Purcell's music with its wild passion and fancy - and she could not stay
in the recollection of that bare lonely past. She was in her brighter a&euml;rial
world again when a little tap came at the door: of course it was her cousin,
who entered in ample white dressing-gown.

<P>`Why, Maggie, you naughty child, haven't you begun to undress?' said
Lucy, in astonishment. `I promised not to come and talk to you, because
I thought you must be tired. But here you are, looking as if you were ready
to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your dressing-gown and unplait
your hair.'

<P>`Well, <I>you</I> are not very forward,' retorted Maggie, hastily reaching
her own pink cotton gown, and looking at Lucy's light brown hair brushed
back in curly disorder.

<P>`O I have not much to do. I shall sit down and talk to you, till I see
you are really on the way to bed.'

<P>While Maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink drapery,
Lucy sat down near the toilette table, watching her with affectionate eyes,
and head a little aside, like a pretty spaniel. If it appears to you at
all incredible that young ladies should be led on to talk confidentially
in a situation of this kind, I will beg you to remember that human life
furnishes many exceptional cases.

<P>`You really <I>have</I> enjoyed the music tonight, haven't you, Maggie?'

<P>`O yes, that is what prevents me from feeling sleepy. I think I should
have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It
seems to infuse strength into my limbs and ideas into my brain. Life seems
to go on without effort, when I am filled with music. At other times one
is conscious of carrying a weight.'

<P>`And Stephen has a splendid voice, hasn't he?'

<P>`Well, perhaps we are neither of us judges of that,' said Maggie, laughing,
as she seated herself and tossed her long hair back. `You are not impartial,
and <I>I</I> think any barrel organ splendid.'

<P>`But tell me what you think of him, now. Tell me exactly - good and
bad too.'

<P>`O I think you should humiliate him a little. A lover should not be
so much at ease and so self-confident. He ought to tremble more.'

<P>`Nonsense, Maggie! As if any one could tremble at me!You think he is
conceited - I see that. But you don't dislike him, do you?'

<P>`Dislike him! No. Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people,
that I should be very difficult to please? Besides how could I dislike
any one that promised to make you happy, you dear thing!' Maggie pinched
Lucy's dimpled chin.

<P>`We shall have more music tomorrow evening,' said Lucy, looking happy
already, `for Stephen will bring Philip Wakem with him.'

<P>`O Lucy, I can't see him,' said Maggie, turning pale. `At least, I could
not see him without Tom's leave.'

<P>`Is Tom such a tyrant as that?' said Lucy, surprised. `I'll take the
responsibility then - tell him it was my fault.'

<P>`But, dear,' said Maggie, faltering, `I promised Tom very solemnly -
before my father's death - I promised him I would not speak to Philip without
his knowledge and consent. And I have a great dread of opening the subject
with Tom - of getting into a quarrel with him again.'

<P>`But I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable. What harm
can poor Philip have done? May I speak to Tom about it?'

<P>`O no, pray don't, dear,' said Maggie. `I'll go to him myself tomorrow,
and tell him that you wish Philip to come. I've thought before of asking
him to absolve me from my promise, but I've not had the courage to determine
on it.'

<P>They were both silent for some moments, and then Lucy said,

<P>`Maggie, you have secrets from me, and I have none from you.'

<P>Maggie looked meditatively away from Lucy. Then she turned to her and
said, `I <I>should</I> like to tell you about Philip. But, Lucy, you must
not betray that you know it to any one - least of all to Philip himself,
or to Mr Stephen Guest.'

<P>The narrative lasted long, for Maggie had never before known the relief
of such an outpouring: she had never before told Lucy anything of her inmost
life; and the sweet face bent towards her with sympathetic interest, and
the little hand pressing hers, encouraged her to speak on. On two points
only she was not expansive. She did not betray fully what still rankled
in her mind as Tom's great offence - the insults he had heaped on Philip.
Angry as the remembrance still made her, she could not bear that any one
else should know it all - both for Tom's sake and Philip's. And she could
not bear to tell Lucy of the last scene between her father and Wakem -
though it was this scene which she had ever since felt to be a new barrier
between herself and Philip. She only told Lucy that she saw now, Tom was
on the whole right in regarding any prospect of love and marriage between
her and Philip as put out of the question by the relation of the two families.
Of course Philip's father would never consent.

<P>`There, Lucy, you have had my story,' said Maggie, smiling with the
tears in her eyes. `You see I am like Sir Andrew Ague-cheek - <I>I</I>
was adored once.'

<P>`Ah, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have
learned so much since you felt school - which always seemed to me witchcraft
before - part of your general uncanniness,' said Lucy.

<P>She mused a little with her eyes downward and then added, looking at
Maggie, `It is very beautiful that you should love Philip: I never thought
such a happiness would befall him. And in my opinion, you ought not to
give him up. There are obstacles now, but they may be done away with in
time.'

<P>Maggie shook her head.

<P>`Yes, yes,' persisted Lucy. `I can't help being hopeful about it. There
is something romantic in it - out of the common way - just what everything
that happens to you ought to be. And Philip will adore you like a husband
in a fairy tale. O I shall puzzle my small brain to contrive some plot
that will bring everybody into the right mind - so that you may marry Philip,
when I marry - somebody else. Wouldn't that be a pretty ending to all my
poor, poor Maggie's troubles?'

<P>Maggie tried to smile, but shivered, as if she felt a sudden chill.

<P>`Ah, dear, you are cold,' said Lucy. `You must go to bed; and so must
I. I dare not think what time it is.'

<P>They kissed each other and Lucy went away - possessed of a confidence
which had a strong influence over her subsequent impressions. Maggie had
been thoroughly sincere: her nature had never found it easy to be otherwise.
But confidences are sometimes blinding even when they are sincere.
