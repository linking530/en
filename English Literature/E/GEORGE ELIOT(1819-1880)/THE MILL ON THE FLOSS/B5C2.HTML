<H2>
Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob's Thumb</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>WHILE Maggie's life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her own
soul, one shadowy army fighting another, and the slain shadows for ever
rising again, Tom was engaged in a dustier, noisier warfare, grappling
with more substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests. So
it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of horses: inside
the gates, the women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers,
watching the world's combat from afar, filling their long, empty days with
memories and fears: outside, the men in fierce struggle with things divine
and human, quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose, losing the
sense of dread and even of wounds in the hurrying ardour of action. From
what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you would
prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished: the wagers are likely
to be on his side notwithstanding his small success in the classics. For
Tom had never desired success in this field of enterprise: and for getting
a fine flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out
on a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest. But
now Tom's strong will bound together his integrity, his pride, his family
regrets and his personal ambition, and made them one force, concentrating
his efforts and surmounting discouragements. His uncle Deane, who watched
him closely, soon began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud
that he had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared
to be made of such good commercial stuff. The real kindness of placing
him in the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in the hints his uncle
began to throw out that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to travel
at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm various vulgar commodities
with which I need not shock refined ears in this place; and it was doubtless
with a view to this result that Mr Deane, when he expected to take his
wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with him an hour, and would
pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising concerning articles of
export and import, with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility
on the relative advantages to the merchants of St Ogg's of having goods
brought in their own and in foreign bottoms - a subject on which Mr Deane,
as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few sparks when he got warmed with
talk and wine. Already, in the second year, Tom's salary was raised; but
all except the price of his dinner and clothes went home into the tin box;
and he shunned comradeship, lest it should lead him into expenses in spite
of himself. Not that Tom was moulded on the spooney type of the Industrious
Apprentice; he had a very strong appetite for pleasure - would have liked
to be a Tamer of horses, and to make a distinguished figure in all neighbouring
eyes, dispensing treats and benefits to others with well-judged liberality,
and being pronounced one of the finest young fellows of those parts; nay,
he determined to achieve these things sooner or later; but his practical
shrewdness told him that the means to such achievements could only lie
for him in present abstinence and self-denial: there were certain milestones
to be passed and one of the first was the payment of his father's debts.
Having made up his mind on that point, he strode along without swerving,
contracting some rather saturnine sternness, as a young man is likely to
do who has a premature call upon him for self-reliance. Tom felt intensely
that common cause with his father which springs from family pride, and
was bent on being irreproachable as a son; but his growing experience caused
him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his
father's past conduct: their dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom's
face showed little radiance during his few home hours. Maggie had an awe
of him, against which she struggled, as something unfair to her consciousness
of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no use to struggle.
A character at unity with itself - that performs what it intends, subdues
every counteracting impulse and has no visions beyond the distinctly possible,
is strong by its very negations.

<P>You may imagine that Tom's more and more obvious unlikeness to his father
was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and Mr Deane's
favourable reports and predictions to Mr Glegg concerning Tom's qualifications
for business, began to be discussed amongst them with various acceptance.
He was likely, it appeared, to do the family credit, without causing it
any expense and trouble. Mrs Pullet has always thought it strange if Tom's
excellent complexion, so entirely that of the Dodsons, did not argue a
certainty that he would turn out well, his juvenile errors of running down
the peacock and general disrespect to his aunts only indicating a tinge
of Tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown. Mr Glegg, who had contracted
a cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behaviour
when the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution
to further his prospects actively - some time, when an opportunity offered
of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs Glegg observed
that she was not given to speak without book, as some people were that
those who said least were mostly likely to find their words made good,
and that when the right moment came, it would be seen who could do something
better than talk. Uncle Pullet, after silent meditation for a period of
several lozenges, came distinctly to the conclusion, that when a young
man was likely to do well, it was better not to meddle with him.

<P>Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself,
though, with a natural sensitiveness towards all indications of favourable
opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him sometimes in
a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be invited to dine at
his house, though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he
was not sure of being punctual. But about a year ago something had occurred
which induced Tom to test his uncle Glegg's friendly disposition.

<P>Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing
Tom and Maggie, awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from St
Ogg's one evening, that they might have a little private talk, He took
the liberty of asking if Mr Tom had ever thought of making money by trading
a bit on his own account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know. Why, by sending
out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had a particular friend
who had offered to do a little business for him in that way, in Laceham
goods, and would be glad to serve Mr Tom on the same footing. Tom was interested
at once, and begged for full explanation; wondering he had not thought
of this plan before. He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation
that might change the slow process of addition into multiplication, that
he at once determined to mention the matter to his father and get his consent
to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a
small cargo. He would rather not have consulted his father, but he had
just paid his last quarter's money into the tin box, and there was no other
resource. All the savings were there: for Mr Tulliver would not consent
to put the money out at interest lest he should lose it. Since he had speculated
in the purchase of some corn and had lost by it, he could not be easy without
keeping the money under his eye.

<P>Tom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth
with his father that evening, and Mr Tulliver listened, learning forward
in his armchair and looking up in Tom's face with a sceptical glance. His
first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some awe of
Tom's wishes, and since he had had the sense of being an `unlucky' father,
he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master.
He took the key of the bureau from his pocket, got out the key of the large
chest, and fetched down the tin box - slowly, as if he were trying to defer
the moment of a painful parting. Then he seated himself against the table
and opened the box with that little padlock-key which he fingered in his
waistcoat pocket in all vacant moments. There they were, the dingy bank
notes and the bright sovereigns, and he counted them out on the table -
only a hundred and sixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching.

<P>`How much do you want, then?' he said, speaking as if the words burnt
his lips.

<P>`Suppose I begin with the thirty six pounds, father?' said Tom.

<P>Mr Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over
it, said,

<P>`It's as much as I can save out o' my pay in a year.'

<P>`Yes, father: it is such work - saving out of the little money we get.
And in this way we might double our savings.'

<P>`Ay, my lad,' said the father, keeping his hand on the money, `but you
might lose it - you might lose a year o' my life - and I haven't got many.'

<P>Tom was silent.

<P>`And you know I wouldn't pay a dividend with the first hundred, because
I wanted to see it all in a lump - and when I see it, I'm sure on't. If
you trust to luck, it's sure to be against me. It's Old Harry's got the
luck in his hands. And if I lose one year, I shall never pick it up again
- death 'ull o'ertake me.'

<P>Mr Tulliver's voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes before
he said,

<P>`I'll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly.'

<P>But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask
his uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving five
per cent of the profits. That was really a very small thing to ask. So
when Bob called the next day at the Wharf to know the decision, Tom proposed
that they should go together to his uncle Glegg's to open the business;
for his diffident pride clung to him, and made him feel that Bob's tongue
would relieve him from some embarrassment.

<P>Mr Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August
day, was naturally counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the sum
total had not varied since yesterday. To him entered Tom, in what appeared
to Mr Glegg very questionable companionship - that of a man with a pack
on his back - for Bob was equipped for a new journey - and of a huge brindled
bull-terrier, who walked with a slow swaying movement from side to side,
and glanced from under his eyelids with a surly indifference which might
after all be a cover to the most offensive designs. Mr Glegg's spectacles,
which had been assisting him in counting the fruit, made these suspicious
details alarmingly evident to him.

<P>`Heigh! Heigh! Keep that dog back, will you,' he shouted, snatching
up a stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were
within three yards of him.

<P>`Get out wi' you, Mumps,' said Bob, with a kick. `He's as quiet as a
lamb, sir,' - an observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as
he retreated behind his master's legs.

<P>`Why, whatever does this mean, Tom?' said Mr Glegg. `Have you brought
information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?' If Bob came in the character
of `information,' Mr Glegg saw reasons for tolerating some irregularity.

<P>`No, sir,' said Tom. `I came to speak to you about a little matter of
business of my own.'

<P>`Ay - well - but what has this dog got to do with it?' said the old
gentleman, getting mild again.

<P>`It's my dog, sir,' said the ready Bob. `An' it's me as put Mr Tom up
to the bit o' business, for Mr Tom's been a friend o' mine iver since I
wor little chap - fust thing iver I did was frightenin' the birds for th'
old master. An' if a bit o' luck turns up, I'm allays thinkin' if I can
let Mr Tom have a pull at it. An' it's a downright roarin' shame, as when
he's got the chance o' making a bit o' money wi' sending goods out - ten
or twelve per zent clear when freight an' commission's paid - as he shouldn't
lay hold o' the chance for want o' money. An' when there's the Laceham
goods - lors, they're made o' purpose for folks as want to send out a little
carguy - light, an' take up no room; you may pack twenty pound so as you
can't see the passill - an' they're manifacturs as please fools, so I reckon
they aren't like to want a market. An' I'd go to Laceham an' buy in the
goods for Mr Tom along wi' my own; an' there's the shupercargo o' the bit
of a vessel as is goin' to take 'em out - I know him partic'lar; he's a
solid man, an' got a family i' the town here: - Salt his name is - an'
a briny chap he is, too - an' if you don't believe me, I can take you to
him.'

<P>Uncle Glegg stood open-mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed
loquacity, with which his understanding could hardly keep pace. He looked
at Bob first over his spectacles, then through them, then over them again;
while Tom, doubtful of his uncle's impression, began to wish he had not
brought this singular Aaron or mouthpiece: Bob's talk appeared less seemly
now some one besides himself was listening to it.

<P>`You seem to be a knowing fellow,' said Mr Glegg, at last.

<P>`Ay, sir, you say true,' returned Bob, nodding his head aside, `I think
my head's all alive inside like an old cheese, for I'm so full o' plans,
one knocks another over. If I hadn't Mumps to talk to, I should get top-heavy
an' tumble in a fit. I suppose it's because I niver went to school much.
That's what I jaw my old mother for - I says, "you should ha' sent me to
school a bit more - " I says - "an' then I could ha' read i' the books
like fun, an' kep' my head cool an' empty." Lors, she's fine an' comfor'ble
now, my old mother is - she ates here baked meat an' taters as often as
she likes. For I'm gettin' so full o' money, I must hev a wife to spend
it for me - but it's botherin' a wife is and Mumps mightn't like her.'

<P>Uncle Glegg, who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired
from business, who beginning to find Bob amusing, but he had still a disapproving
observation to make, which kept his face serious.

<P>`Ah,' he said, `I should think you're at a loss for ways o'spending
your money, else you wouldn't keep that big dog, to eat as much as two
Christians. It's shameful - shameful!' But he spoke more in sorrow than
in anger, and quickly added,

<P>`But, come now, let's hear more about this business, Tom. I suppose
you want a little sum to make a venture with. But where's all your own
money? - You don't spend it all, eh?'

<P>`No, sir,' said Tom, colouring. `But my father is unwilling to risk
it, and I don't like to press him. If I could get twenty or thirty pounds
to begin with I could pay five per cent for it, and then I could gradually
make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan.'

<P>`Ay... Ay,' said Mr Glegg, in an approving tone. `That's not a bad notion,
and I won't say as I wouldn't be your man. But it'll be as well for me
to see this Salt, as you talk on. And then... here's this friend o' yours
offers to buy the goods for you. Perhaps you've got somebody to stand surety
for you, if the money's put into your hands?' added the cautious old gentleman,
looking over his spectacles at Bob.

<P>`I don't think that's necessary, uncle,' said Tom. `At least, I mean
it would not be necessary for me, because I know Bob well; but perhaps
it would be right for you to have some security.'

<P>`You get your per-centage out o' the purchase, I suppose?' said Mr Glegg,
looking at Bob.

<P>`No, sir,' said Bob, rather indignantly, `I didn't offer to get a apple
for Mr Tom, o' purpose to hev a bite out of it myself. When I play folks
tricks there'll be more fun in 'em nor that.'

<P>`Well, but it's nothing but right you should have a small per-centage,'
said Mr Glegg. `I've no opinion o' transactions where folks do things for
nothing. It allays looks bad.'

<P>`Well, then,' said Bob, whose keenness saw at once what was implied,
`I'll tell you what I get by't, an' it's money in my pocket in the end.
I make myself look big, wi' makin' a bigger purchase. That's what I'm thinking
on. Lors, I'm a 'cute chap, I am.'

<P>`Mr Glegg, Mr Glegg,' said a severe voice from the open parlour window,
`pray are you coming in to tea? - or are you going to stand talking with
packmen till you get murdered in th' open daylight?'

<P>`Murdered?' said Mr Glegg; `what's the woman talking of? Here's your
nevvy Tom come about a bit o' business.'

<P>`Murdered - yes - it isn't many 'sizes ago, since a packman murdered
a young woman in a lone place and stole her thimble and threw here body
into a ditch.'

<P>`Nay, nay,' said Mr Glegg, soothingly, `you're thinking o' the man wi'
no legs, as drove a dog-cart.'

<P>`Well, it's the same thing, Mr Glegg - only you're found o' contradicting
what I say. And if my nevvy's come about business, it 'ud be more fitting
if you'd bring him into the house, and let his aunt know about it, instead
o' whispering in corners, in that plotting, underminding way.'

<P>`Well, well,' said Mr Glegg, `we'll come in now.'

<P>`You needn't stay here,' said the lady to Bob, in a loud voice, adapted
to the moral not the physical distance between them. `We don't want anything.
I don't deal wi' packmen. Mind you shut the gate after you.'

<P>`Stop a bit; not so fast,' said Mr Glegg: `I haven't done with this
young man yet. Come in, Tom, come in,' he added, stepping in at the French
window.

<P>`Mr Glegg,' said Mrs G. in a fatal tone. `If you're going to let that
man and his dog in on my carpet before my very face, be so good as to let
me know. A wife's got a right to ask that, I hope.'

<P>`Don't you be uneasy, mum,' said Bob, touching his cap. He saw at once
that Mrs Glegg was a bit of game worth running down, and longed to be at
the sport. `We'll stay out upo' the gravel here, Mumps and me will. Mumps
knows his company - he does. I might hish at him by th' hour together before
he'd fly at a real gentlewoman like you. It's wonderful how he knows which
is the good-looking ladies - and's partic'lar fond of 'em when they've
good shapes. Lors,' added Bob, laying down his pack on the gravel, `it's
a thousand pities such a lady as you shouldn't deal with a packman, i'stead
o' goin' into these newfangled shops where there's half a dozen fine gents
wi' their chins propped up wi' a stiff stock, a-looking like bottles wi'
ornamental stoppers, an' all got to get their dinner out of a bit o' calico
- it stan's to reason you mun pay three times the price you pay a packman,
as is the nat'ral way o' gettin' goods - an' pays no rent, an' isn't forced
to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on him, whether he will
or no. But lors, mum, you know what it is better nor I do - <I>you</I>
can see through them shopmen, I'll be bound.'

<P>`Yes, I reckon I can, and through the packmen too,' observed Mrs Glegg,
intending to imply that Bob's flattery had produced no effect on <I>her</I>;
while her husband standing behind her with his hands in his pockets and
legs apart, winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the probability
of his wife's being circumvented.

<P>`Ay, to be sure, mum,' said Bob. `Why, you must ha' dealt wi' no end
o' packmen when you war a young lass - before the master here had the luck
to set eyes on you. I know where you lived, I do - seen th' house many
a time - close upon Squire Darleigh's - a stone house wi' steps... '

<P>`Ah, that it had,' said Mrs Glegg, pouring out the tea. `You know something
o' my family then... are you akin to that packman with a squint in his
eye, as used to bring th' Irish linen?'

<P>`Look you there now!' said Bob evasively. `Didn't I know as you'd remember
the best bargains y'ever made in your life was made wi' packmen? Why, you
see, even a squintin' packman's better nor a shopman as can see straight.
Lors, if I'd had the luck to call at the stone house wi' my pack as lies
here,' - stooping and thumping the bundle emphatically with his fist -
`an' th' handsome young lasses all stannin' out on the stone steps, it
'ud ha' been summat like openin' a pack - that would. It's on'y the poor
houses now as a packman calls on, if it isn't for the sake o' the sarvant-maids.
They're paltry times, there are. Why, mum, look at the printed cottons
now, an' what they was when you wore 'em - why, you wouldn't put such a
thing on now, I can see. It must be first-rate quality - the manifactur
as you'd buy - summat as 'ud wear as well as your own faitures.'

<P>`Yes, better quality nor any you're like to carry: you've got nothing
first-rate but brazenness, I'll be bound,' said Mrs Glegg, with a triumphant
sense of her insurmountable sagacity. `Mr Glegg, are you going ever to
sit down to your tea? Tom, there's a cup for you.'

<P>`You speak true there, mum,' said Bob. `My pack isn't for ladies like
you. The time's gone by for that. Bargains picked up dirt cheap - a bit
o' damage here an' there, as can be cut out or else niver seen i' the wearin';
but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o' things as
nobody sees. I'm not the man as 'ud offer t' open my pack to you, mum:
no, no; I'm imperent chap, as you say - these times makes folks imperent
- but I'm not to put the mark o' that.'

<P>`Why, what goods to you carry in your pack?' said Mrs Glegg. `Fine-coloured
things, I suppose, shawls an' that.'

<P>`All sorts, mum, all sorts,' said Bob, thumping his bundle, `but let
us say no more about that, if <I>you</I> please. I'm here upo' Mr Tom's
business an' I'm not the man to take up the time wi' my own.'

<P>`And pray, what <I>is</I> this business as is to be kept from me?' said
Mrs Glegg, who, solicited by a double curiosity, was obliged to let the
one half wait.

<P>`A little plan o' nevvy Tom's here,' said good-natured Mr Glegg; `and
not altogether a bad un, I think. A little plan for making money that's
the right sort o' plan for young folks as have got their fortin to make,
eh, Jane?'

<P>`But I hope it isn't a plan where he expects iverything to be done for
him by his friends - that's what the young folks think of mostly nowadays.
And pray, what has this pack-man got to do wi' what goes on in our family?
Can't you speak for yourself Tom, and let your aunt know things, as a nevvy
should?'

<P>`This is Bob Jakin, aunt,' said Tom, bridling the irritation that aunt
Glegg's voice always produced. `I've known him ever since we were little
boys. He's a very good fellow, and always ready to do me a kindness. And
he has had some experience in sending goods out - a small part of a cargo
as a private speculation; and he thinks if I could begin to do a little
in the same way, I might make some money. A large interest is got in that
way.'

<P>`Large int'rest?' said aunt Glegg, with eagerness, `and what do you
call large int'rest?'

<P>`Ten or twelve per cent,' Bob says, `after expenses are paid.'

<P>`Then why wasn't I let to know o' such things before, Mr Glegg?' said
Mrs Glegg, turning to her husband, with a deep grating tone of reproach.
`Haven't you allays told me as there was no getting more nor five per cent.'

<P>`Pooh, pooh, nonsense, my good woman,' said Mr Glegg. `You couldn't
go into trade, could you? You can't get more than five per cent with security.'

<P>`But I can turn a bit o' money for you, an' welcome, mum,' said Bob,
`if you'd like to risk it - not as there's any risk to speak on. But if
you'd a mind to lend a bit o' money to Mr Tom, he'd pay you six or seven
per zent an' get a trifle for himself as well an' a good-natur'd lady like
you 'ud like the feel o' the money better if your nevvy took part on it.'

<P>`What do you say, Mrs G.?' said Mr Glegg. `I've a notion, when I've
made a bit more inquiry, as I shall perhaps start Tom here with a bit of
a nest-egg - he'll pay me int'rest, you know - an' if you've got some little
sums lyin' idle twisted up in a stockin' toe, or that... '

<P>`Mr Glegg, it's beyond iverything! You'll go and give information to
the tramps next, as they may come and rob me.'

<P>`Well, well, as I was sayin', if you like to join me wi' twenty pounds,
you can - I'll make it fifty. That'll be a pretty good nest-egg - eh, Tom?'

<P>`You're not counting on me, Mr Glegg, I hope,' said his wife. `You could
do fine things wi' my money, I don't doubt.' `Very well,' said Mr Glegg,
rather snappishly, `then we'll do without you. I shall go with you to see
this Salt,' he added, turning to Bob.

<P>`And now, I suppose, you'll go all the other way, Mr Glegg,' said Mrs
G., `and want to shunt me out o' my own nevvy's business. I never said
I wouldn't put money into it - I don't say as it shall be twenty pounds,
though you're so ready to say it for me - but he'll see some day as his
aunt's in the right not to risk the money she's saved for him till it's
proved as it won't be lost.'

<P>`Ay, that's a pleasant sort o' risk, that is,' said Mr Glegg, indiscreetly
winking at Tom, who couldn't avoid smiling. But Bob stemmed the injured
lady's outburst.

<P>`Ay, mum,' he said, admiringly, `you know what's what, you do. An' it's
nothing but fair. <I>You</I> see how the first bit of a job answers, an'
then you'll come down handsome. Lors, it's a fine thing to hev good kin.
I got my bit of a nest-egg as the master calls it, all by my own sharpness
- ten suvreigns it was - wi' dousing the fire at Torry's mill, an' it's
growed an' growed by a bit an' a bit, till I'n got a matter o' thirty pound
to lay out, besides makin' my mother comfor'ble. I should get more, on'y
I'm such a soft wi' the women - I can't help lettin' 'em hev such good
bargains. There's this bundle, now' (thumping it lustily), `any other chap
'ud make a pretty penny out on it. But me!... lors, I shall sell 'em for
pretty near what I paid for 'em.'

<P>`Have you got a bit of good net, now?' said Mrs Glegg, in a patronising
tone, moving from the tea-table, and folding her napkin.

<P>`Eh, mum, not what you'd think it worth your while to look at. I'd scorn
to show it you. It 'ud be an insult to you.'

<P>`But let me see,' said Mrs Glegg, still patronising. `If they're damaged
goods, they're like enough to be a bit the better quality.'

<P>`No, mum. I know my place,' said Bob, lifting up his pack and shouldering
it. `I'm not going t' expose the lowness o' my trade to a lady like you.
Packs is come down i' the world: it 'ud cut you to th' heart to see the
difference. I'm at your service, sir, when you've a mind to go an' see
Salt.'

<P>`All in good time,' said Mr Glegg, really unwilling to cut short the
dialogue. `Are you wanted at the wharf, Tom?'

<P>`No, sir; I left Stowe in my place.'

<P>`Come, put down you pack, and let me see,' said Mrs Glegg, drawing a
chair to the window, and seating herself with much dignity.

<P>`Don't you ask it, mum,' said Bob, entreatingly.

<P>`Make no more words,' said Mrs Glegg, severely, `but do as I tell you.'

<P>`Eh, mum, I'm loth - that I am,' said Bob, slowly depositing his pack
on the step, and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers. `But what
you order shall be done' (much fumbling in pauses between the sentences).
`It's not as you'll buy a single thing on me... I'd be sorry for you to
do it... for think o' them poor women up i' the villages there, as niver
stir a hundred yards from home... it 'ud be a pity for anybody to buy up
their bargains. Lors, it's as good as a junketing to 'em when they see
me wi' my pack... an' I shall niver pick up such bargains for 'em again.
Least ways, I've no time now, for I'm off to Laceham. See here, now,' Bob
went on, becoming rapid again, and holding up a scarlet woollen kerchief
with an embroidered wreath in the corner - `Here's a thing to make a lass's
mouth water, an' on'y two shillin' - an' why? Why, 'cause there's a bit
of a moth-hole i' this plain end. Lors, I think the moths an' the mildew
was sent by Providence o' purpose to cheapen the goods a bit for the good
lookin' women as han't got much money. If it hadn't been for the moths,
now, every hankicher on 'em 'ud ha' gone to the rich handsome ladies like
you, mum, at five shillin' apiece - not a farthin' less - but what does
the moth do? Why, it nibbles off three shillin' o' the price i' no time,
an' then a packman like me can carry't to the poor lasses as live under
the dark thack, to make a bit of a blaze for 'em. Lors, it's as good as
a fire, to look at such a hankicher!'

<P>Bob held at a distance for admiration, but Mrs Glegg said sharply,

<P>`Yes, but nobody wants a fire this time o' year. Put these coloured
things by - let me look at your nets, if you've got 'em.'

<P>`Eh, mum, I told you how it 'ud be,' said Bob, flinging aside the coloured
things with an air of desperation. `I knowed it 'ud turn again' you to
look at such paltry articles as I carry. Here's a piece o' figured muslim
now - what's the use o' your lookin' at it? You might as well look at poor
folks's victual, mum - it 'ud on'y take away your appetite. There's a yard
i' the middle on't, as the pattern's all missed - lors, why it's a muslin
as the Princess Victoree might ha' wore - but,' added Bob, flinging it
behind him on to the turf, as if to save Mrs Glegg's eyes, `it'll be bought
up by th' huckster's wife at Fibb's End - that's where <I>it</I>'ll go
- ten shillin' for the whole lot - ten yards, countin' the damaged 'un
- five-an'-twenty shillin' 'ud ha' been the price - not a penny less. But
I'll say no more, mum, it's nothing to you - a piece o' muslim like that
- you can afford to pay three times the money for a thing as isn't half
so good. It's nets <I>you</I> talked on - well, I've got a piece as 'ull
serve you to make fun on... '

<P>`Bring me that muslin,' said Mrs Glegg, `it's a buff - I'm partial to
buff.'

<P>`Eh, but a <I>damaged</I> thing,' said Bob, in a tone of deprecating
disgust. `You'd do nothing with it, mum - you'd give it to the cook, I
know you would - an' it 'ud be a pity - she'd look too much like a lady
in it - it's unbecoming for sarvants.'

<P>`Fetch it and let me see you measure it,' said Mrs Glegg, authoritatively.

<P>Bob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance.

<P>`See what there is over measure!' he said, holding forth the extra half
yard, while Mrs Glegg was busy examining the damaged yard and throwing
her head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a distant view.

<P>`I'll give you six shilling for it,' she said, throwing it down with
the air of a person who mentions an ultimatum.

<P>`Didn't I tell you, now, mum, as it 'ud hurt your feelings to look at
my pack? That damaged bit's turned your stomach now, I see it has,' said
Bob, wrapping the muslim up with the utmost quickness, and apparently about
to fasten up his pack. `You're used to seein' a different sort o' article
carried by packmen, when you lived at the Stone House. Packs is come down
i' the world, I told you that: <I>my</I> goods are for common folks. Mrs
Pepper 'ull give me ten shillin' for that muslin, an' be sorry as I didn't
ask her more. Such articles answer i' the wearin' - they keep their colour
till the threads melt away i' the wash-tub, an' that won't be while <I>I</I>'m
a young un.'

<P>`Well, seven shilling,' said Mrs Glegg.

<P>`Put it out o' your mind, mum, now do,' said Bob. `Here's a bit o' net,
then, for you to look at before I tie my pack: just for you to see what
my trade's come to: spotted and sprigged, you see, beautiful, but yallow--'s
been lyin' by an' got the wrong colour. I could niver ha' bought such net,
if it hadn't been yallow. Lors, it's took me a deal o' study to know the
vally o' such articles: when I begun to carry a pack I was as ignirant
as a pig - net or calico was all the same to me. I thought them things
the most vally as was the thickest. I was took in dreadful - for I'm a
strait-forrard chap - up to no tricks, mum. I can on'y say my nose is my
own, for if I went beyond, I should lose myself pretty quick. An' I gev
five an' eightpence for that piece o' net - if I was to tell y' anything
else I should be tellin' you fibs: an' five an' eightpence I shall ask
for it - not a penny more - for it's a woman's article, an' I like to 'commodate
the women. Five an' eightpence for six yards - as cheap as if it was only
the dirt on it was paid for.'

<P>`I don't mind having three yards of it,' said Mrs Glegg.

<P>`Why, there's but six altogether,' said Bob - `no, mum, it isn't worth
your while: you can go to the shop tomorrow an' get the same pattern ready
whitened. It's on'y three times the money - what's that to a lady like
you?' He gave an emphatic tie to his bundle.

<P>`Come, lay me out that muslin,' said Mrs Glegg. `Here's eight shilling
for it.'

<P>`You <I>will</I> be jokin', mum,' said Bob, looking up with a laughing
face. `I see'd you was a pleasant lady, when I fust come to the winder.'

<P>`Well, put it me out,' said Mrs Glegg, peremptorily.

<P>`But if I let you have it for ten shillin', mum, you'll be so good as
not tell nobody. I should be a laughin'-stock - the trade, 'ud hoot me,
if they knowed it. I'm obliged to make believe as I ask more nor I do for
my goods, else they'd find out I war a flat. I'm glad you don't insist
upo' buyin' the net, for then I should ha' lost my two best bargains for
Mrs Pepper o' Fibb's End - an' she's a rare customer.'

<P>`Let me look at the net again,' said Mrs Glegg, yearning after the cheap
spots and sprigs now they were vanishing.

<P>`Well, I can't deny <I>you</I>, mum,' said Bob, handing it out. `Eh
see what a pattern now! Real Laceham goods. Now, this is the sort o' article
I'm recommendin' Mr Tom to send out. Lors, it's a fine thing for anybody
as has got a bit o' money - these Laceham goods 'ud make it breed like
maggits. If I was a lady wi' a bit o' money! - why, I know one as put thirty
pound into them goods - a lady wi' a cork leg, but as sharp - you wouldn't
catch <I>her</I> runnin' her head into a sack: <I>she</I>'d see her way
clear out o' anything afore she'd be in a hurry to start. Well, she let
out thirty pound to a young man in the drapering line, and he laid it out
i' Laceham goods, an' a shupercargo o' my acquinetance (not Salt) took
'em out, an' she got her eight per zent fust go off - an' now you can't
hold her but she must be sendin' out carguies wi' every ship, till she's
gettin' as rich as a Jew. Bucks her name is - she doesn't live i' this
town. Now, then, mum, if you'll please to give me the net... '

<P>`Here's fifteen shilling, then, for the two,' said Mrs Glegg. `But it's
a shameful price.'

<P>`Nay, mum, you'll niver say that when you're upo' your knees i' church
i' five years' time. I'm makin' you a present o' th' articles - I am, indeed.
That eightpence shaves off my profit as clean as a razor. Now then, sir,'
continued Bob, shouldering his pack, `if <I>you</I> please, I'll be glad
to go and see about makin' Mr Tom's fortin. Eh, I wish I'd got another
twenty pound to lay out for <I>my</I>sen: I shouldn't stay to say my Catechism
afore I know'd what to do wi't.'

<P>`Stop a bit, Mr Glegg,' said the lady, as her husband took his hat,
`you never <I>will</I> give me the chance o' speaking. You'll go away now,
and finish everything about this business, and come back and tell me it's
too late for me to speak. As if I wasn't my nevvy's own aunt, and th' head
o' the family on his mother's side! and laid by guineas, all full weight
for him - as he'll know who to respect when I'm laid in my coffin.'

<P>`Well, Mrs G., say what you mean,' said Mr G. hastily.

<P>`Well, then, I desire as nothing may be done without my knowing. I don't
say as I shan't venture twenty pounds, if you make out as everything's
right and safe. And if I do, Tom,' concluded Mrs Glegg, turning impressively
to her nephew, `I hope you'll allays bear it in mind and be grateful for
such an aunt - I mean you to pay me interest, you know - I don't approve
o' giving: we niver looked for that in <I>my</I> family.'

<P>`Thank you, aunt,' said Tom, rather proudly. `I prefer having the money
only lent to me.'

<P>`Very well: that's the Dodson sperrit,' said Mrs Glegg, rising to get
her knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would be
bathos.

<P>Salt - that eminently `briny chap' - having been discovered in a cloud
of tobacco smoke at the Anchor Tavern, Mr Glegg commenced inquiries which
turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the `nest-egg,'
to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds; and in this modest beginning
you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise surprise you, namely,
Tom's accumulation of a fund, unknown to his father, that promised in no
very long time to meet the more tardy process of saving and quite cover
the deficit. When once his attention had been turned to this source of
gain, Tom determined to make the most of it, and lost no opportunity of
obtaining information and extending his small enterprises. In not telling
his father, he was influenced by that strange mixture of opposite feelings
which often gives equal truth to those who blame an action and those who
admire it: partly, it was that disinclination to confidence which is seen
between near kindred - that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred
relations of our lives; partly, it was the desire to surprise his father
with a great joy. He did not see that it would have been better to soothe
the interval with a new hope, and prevent the delirium of a too sudden
elation.

<P>At the time of Maggie's first meeting with Philip, Tom had already nearly
a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital, and while they were walking
by the evening light in the Red Deeps, he, by the same evening light, was
riding into Laceham, proud of being on his first journey on behalf of Guest
and Co., and revolving in his mind all the chances that by the end of another
year he should have doubled his gains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from
his father's name, and perhaps - for he should be twenty-one - have got
a new start for himself, on a higher platform of employment. Did he not
deserve it? He was quite sure that he did.
