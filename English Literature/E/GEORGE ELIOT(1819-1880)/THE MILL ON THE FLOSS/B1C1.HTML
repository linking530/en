had half of it been taken from him. 

He had only come here because he was ill and somebody was hunting him--

somebody was after him he had told nobody anything, he had kept

his mouth shut.  Bulstrode, not knowing the significance of

these symptoms, interpreted this new nervous susceptibility into

a means of alarming Raffles into true confessions, and taxed him

with falsehood in saying that he had not told anything, since he

had just told the man who took him up in his gig and brought him

to Stone Court.  Raffles denied this with solemn adjurations;

the fact being that the links of consciousness were interrupted in him,

and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to Caleb Garth had been

delivered under a set of visionary impulses which had dropped back

into darkness.



Bulstrode's heart sank again at this sign that he could get no

grasp over the wretched man's mind, and that no word of Raffles

could be trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know,

namely, whether or not he had really kept silence to every one in

the neighborhood except Caleb Garth.  The housekeeper had told him

without the least constraint of manner that since Mr. Garth left,

Raffles had asked her for beer, and after that had not spoken,

seeming very ill.  On that side it might be concluded that there

had been no betrayal.  Mrs. Abel thought, like the servants at

The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the unpleasant "kin"

who are among the troubles of the rich; she had at first referred

the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property left,

the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural enough. 

How he could be "kin" to Bulstrode as well was not so clear,

but Mrs. Abel agreed with her husband that there was "no knowing,"

a proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her,

so that she shook her head over it without further speculation.



In less thanew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak

further on the subject.



As for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set

off for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.



His mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language

to his hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations

which shake our whole system.  The deep humiliation with which he

had winced under Caleb Garth's knowledge of his past and rejection

of his patronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense

of safety in the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man

to whom Raffles had spoken.  It seemed to him a sort of earnest

that Providence intended his rescue from worse consequences;

the way being thus left open for the hope of secrecy.  That Raffles

should be afflicted with illness, that he should have been led

to Stone Court rather than elsewhere--Bulstrode's heart fluttered

at the vision of probabilities which these events conjured up. 

If it should turn out that he was freed from all danger of disgrace--

if he could breathe in perfect liberty--his life should be more

consecrated than it had ever been before.  He mentally lifted

up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed for--

he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution--

its potency to determine death.  He knew that he ought to say,

"Thy will be done;" and he said it often.  But the intense desire

remained that the will of God might be the death of that hated man.



Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change

in Raffles without a shock.  But for his pallor and feebleness,

Bulstrode would have called the change in him entirely mental. 

Instead of his loud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror,

and seemed to deprecate Bulstrode's anger, because the money was

all gone--he had been robbed--it the trees.

<P>Now I can turn my eyes towards the mill again and watch the unresting
wheel sending out its diamond jets of water. That little girl is watching
it too: she has been standing on just the same spot at the edge of the
water ever since I paused on the bridge. And that queer white cur with
the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance
with the wheel; perhaps he is jealous because his playfellow in the beaver
bonnet is so rapt in its movement. It is time the little playfellow went
in, I think; and there is a very bright fire to tempt her: the red light
shines out under the deepening grey of the sky. It is time too for me to
leave off resting my arms on the cold stone of this bridge... .

<P>Ah, my arms are really benumbed. I have been pressing my elbows on the
arms of my chair and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front
of Dorlcote Mill as it looked one February afternoon many years ago. Before
I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr and Mrs Tulliver were talking
about as they sat by the bright fire in the left-hand parlour on that very
afternoon I have been dreaming of.
