Tom's `First Half'</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>TOM TULLIVER'S sufferings during the first quarter he was at King's
Lorton under the distinguished care of the Rev. Walter Stelling were rather
severe. At Mr Jacobs' Academy, life had not presented itself to him as
a difficult problem: there were plenty of fellows to play with, and Tom
being good at all active games, fighting especially, had that precedence
among them which appeared to him inseparable from the personality of Tom
Tulliver; Mr Jacobs himself, familiarly known as Old Goggles, from his
habit of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful awe; and if it was the
property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write like copperplate and
surround their signatures with arabesques, to spell without forethought,
and to spout `My name is Norval' without bungling, Tom for his part was
rather glad he was not in danger of those mean accomplishments. He was
not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster - he; but a substantial man, like
his father, who used to go hunting when he was younger, and rode a capital
black mare - as pretty a bit of horse-flesh as ever you saw: Tom had heard
what her points were a hundred times. <I>He</I> meant to go hunting too,
and to be generally respected. When people were grown up, he considered,
nobody inquired about their writing and spelling: when he was a man, he
should be master of everything and do just as he liked. It had been very
difficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea that his school-time
was to be prolonged, and that he was not to be brought up to his father's
business, which he had always thought extremely pleasant, for it was nothing
but riding about, giving orders, and going to market; and he thought that
a clergyman would give him a great many Scripture lessons, and probably
make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a Sunday as well as the Collect.
But in the absence of specific information, it was impossible for him to
imagine that school and a schoolmaster would be something entirely different
from the Academy and Mr Jacobs. So, not to be at a deficiency, in case
of his finding genial companions, he had taken care to carry with him a
small box of percussion caps; not that there was anything particular to
be done with them, but they would serve to impress strange boys with a
sense of his familiarity with guns. Thus poor Tom, though he saw very clearly
through Maggie's illusions, was not without illusions of his own, which
were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at King's Lorton.
He had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that life,
complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new standard of
English pronunciation, was a very difficult business, made all the more
obscure by a thick mist of bashfulness. Tom, as you have observed, was
never an exception among boys for ease of address; but the difficulty of
enunciating a monosyllable in reply to Mr or Mrs Stelling was so great,
that he even dreaded to be asked at table whether he would have more pudding.
As to the percussion caps, he had almost resolved, in the bitterness of
his heart that he would throw them into a neighbouring pond: for not only
was he the solitary pupil, but he began even to have a certain scepticism
about guns, and a general sense that his theory of life was undermined.
For Mr Stelling thought nothing of guns, or horses either, apparently;
and yet it was impossible for Tom to despise Mr Stelling as he had despised
Old Goggles. If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about
Mr Stelling, it lay quite beyond Tom's power to detect it: it is only by
a wide comparison of facts that the wisest full-grown man can distinguish
well-rolled barrels from more supernal thunder.

<P>Mr Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with
flaxen hair standing erect, and large lightish-grey eyes, which were always
very wide open; he had a sonorous bass voice, and an air of defiant self-confidence
inclining to brazenness. He had entered on his career with great vigour,
and intended to make a considerable impression on his fellow-men. The Rev.
Walter Stelling was not a man who would remain among the `inferior clergy'
all his life. He had a true British determination to push his way in the
world. As a schoolmaster, in the first place: for there were capital masterships
of grammar-schools to be had, and Mr Stelling meant to have one of them.
But as a preacher also, for he meant always to preach in a striking manner,
so as to have his congregation swelled by admirers from neighbouring parishes,
and to produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a
brother clergyman of minor gifts. The style of preaching he had chosen
was the extemporaneous, which was held little short of the miraculous in
rural parishes like King's Lorton. Some passages of Massillon and Bourdaloue,
which he knew by heart, were really very effective when rolled out in Mr
Stelling's deepest tones, but as comparatively feeble appeals of his own
were delivered in the same loud and impressive manner, they were often
thought quite as striking by his hearers. Mr Stelling's doctrine was of
no particular school: if anything, it had a tinge of evangelicalism, for
that was `the telling thing' just then in the diocese to which King's Lorton
belonged. In short, Mr Stelling was a man who meant to rise in his profession,
and to rise by merit, clearly, since he had no interest beyond what might
be promised by a problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not
yet become Lord Chancellor. A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions
naturally gets a little into debt at starting: it is not to be expected
that he will live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate
all his life, and if the few hundreds Mr Timpson advanced towards his daughter's
fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture together
with a stock of wine, a grand piano, and the laying-out of a superior flower-garden,
it followed in the most rigorous manner, either that these things must
be procured by some other means, or else, that the Rev. Mr Stelling must
go without them - which last alternative would be an absurd procrastination
of the fruits of success, where success was certain. Mr Stelling was so
broad-chested and resolute that he felt equal to anything: he would become
celebrated by shaking the consciences of his hearers, and he would by and
by edit a Greek play, and invent several new readings. He had not yet selected
the play, for having been married little more than two years, his leisure
time had been much occupied with attentions to Mrs Stelling; but he had
told that fine woman what he meant to do some day, and she felt great confidence
in her husband, as a man who understood everything of that sort.

<P>But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver
during this first half-year; for, by a singular coincidence, there had
been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same neighbourhood,
and it might further a decision in Mr Stelling's favour, if it were understood
that young Tulliver, who, Mr Stelling observed in conjugal privacy, was
rather a rough cub, had made prodigious progress in a short time. It was
on this ground that he was severe with Tom about his lessons: he was clearly
a boy whose powers would never be developed through the medium of the Latin
grammar without the application of some sternness. Not that Mr Stelling
was a harsh-tempered or unkind man - quite the contrary: he was jocose
with Tom at table, and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment
in the most playful manner: but poor Tom was only the more cowed and confused
by this double novelty, for he had never been used to jokes at all like
Mr Stelling's, and for the first time in his life he had a painful sense
that he was all wrong somehow. When Mr Stelling said, as the roast beef
was being uncovered, `Now, Tulliver! which would you rather decline, roast
beef or the Latin for it?' - Tom, to whom in his coolest moments a pun
would have been a hard nut, was thrown into a state of embarrassed alarm
that made everything dim to him except the feeling that he would rather
not have anything to do with Latin: of course he answered, `Roast beef,'
- whereupon there followed much laughter and some practical joking with
the plates, from which Tom gathered that he had in some mysterious way
refused beef, and, in fact, made himself appear `a silly.' If he could
have seen a fellow-pupil undergo these painful operations and survive them
in good spirits, he might sooner have taken them as a matter of course.
But there are two expensive forms of education, either of which a parent
may procure for his son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman:
one is, the enjoyment of the reverend gentleman's undivided neglect; the
other is, the endurance of the reverend gentleman's undivided attention.
It was the latter privilege for which Mr Tulliver paid a high price in
Tom's initiatory months at King's Lorton.

<P>That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind and driven
homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction. He considered that it
was a happy moment for him when he had thought of asking Riley's advice
about a tutor for Tom. Mr Stelling's eyes were so wide open, and he talked
in such an off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every difficult slow
remark of Mr Tulliver's with, `I see, my good sir, I see,' `To be sure,
to be sure,' `You want your son to be a man who will make his way in the
world,' that Mr Tulliver was delighted to find in him a clergyman whose
knowledge was so applicable to the everyday affairs of this life. Except
Counsellor Wylde, whom he had heard at the last sessions, Mr Tulliver thought
the Rev. Mr Stelling was the shrewdest fellow he had ever met with; not
unlike Wylde, in fact - he had the same way of sticking his thumbs in the
armholes of his waistcoat. Mr Tulliver was not by any means an exception
in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness: most laymen thought Stelling shrewd,
and a man of remarkable powers generally: it was chiefly by his clerical
brethren that he was considered rather a dull fellow. But he told Mr Tulliver
several stories about `Swing' and incendiarism, and asked his advice about
feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a manner, with so much
polished glibness of tongue, that the miller thought, here was the very
thing he wanted for Tom. He had no doubt this first-rate man was acquainted
with every branch of information, and knew exactly what Tom must learn
in order to become a match for the lawyers - which poor Mr Tulliver himself
and did <I>not</I> know, and so was necessarily thrown for self-direction
on this wide kind of inference. It is hardly fair to laugh at him, for
I have known much more highly-instructed persons than he make inferences
quite as wide, and not at all wiser.

<P>As for Mrs Tulliver, finding that Mrs Stelling's views as to the airing
of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy, entirely
coincided with her own, moreover, that Mrs Stelling, though so young a
woman, and only anticipating her second confinement, had gone through very
nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the behaviour and
fundamental character of the monthly nurse - she expressed great contentment
to her husband when they drove away, at leaving Tom with a woman who, in
spite of her youth, seemed quite sensible and motherly, and asked advice
as prettily as could be.

<P>`They must be very well off, though,' said Mrs Tulliver, `for everything's
as nice as can be all over the house, and that watered silk she had on
cost a pretty penny. Sister Pullet has got one like it.'

<P>`Ah,' said Mr Tulliver, `he's got some income besides the curacy, I
reckon - perhaps her father allows 'em something. There's Tom 'ull be another
hundred to him - and not much trouble either, by his own account: he says
teaching comes natural to him. That's wonderful, now,' added Mr Tulliver,
turning his head on one side and giving his horse a meditative tickling
on the flank.

<P>Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr Stelling that he
set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of circumstances
which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be under the immediate
teaching of nature. Mr Broderip's amiable beaver, as that charming naturalist
tells us, busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam, in a room
up three pairs of stairs in London, as if he had been laying his foundation
in a stream or lake in Upper Canada. It was `Binny's' function to build:
the absense of water or of possible progeny was an accident for which he
was not accountable. With the same unerring instinct Mr Stelling set to
work at his natural method of instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into
the mind of Tom Tulliver. This, he considered, was the only basis of solid
instruction: all other means of education were mere charlatanism, and could
produce nothing better than smatterers. Fixed on this firm basis, a man
might observe the display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly
educated people with a pitying smile: all that sort of thing was very well,
but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions. In holding
this conviction Mr Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors have been,
by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship, and as to his
views about Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from personal partiality.
Mr Stelling was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm, either religious
or intellectual: on the other hand, he had no secret belief that everything
was humbug. He thought religion was a very excellent thing, and Aristotle
a great authority, and deaneries and prebends useful institutions, and
Great Britain the providential bulwark of Protestantism, and faith in the
unseen a great support to afflicted minds: he believed in all these things
as a Swiss hotel keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him,
and in the pleasure it gives to artistic visitors. And in the same way
Mr Stelling believed in his method of education: he had no doubt that he
was doing the very best thing for Mr Tulliver's boy. Of course, when the
miller talked of mapping and summing in a vague and diffident manner, Mr
Stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he understood what
was wanted; for how was it possible the good man could form any reasonable
judgement about the matter? Mr Stelling's duty was to teach the lad in
the only right way - indeed, he knew no other: he had not wasted his time
in the acquirement of anything abnormal.

<P>He very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though
by hard labour he could get particular declensions into his brain, anything
so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations could by no
means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to recognise a chance
genitive or dative. This struck Mr Stelling as something more than natural
stupidity: he suspected obstinacy, or at any rate, indifference, and lectured
Tom severely on his want of thorough application. `You feel no interest
in what you're doing, sir,' Mr Stelling would say, and the reproach was
painfully true. Tom had never found any difficulty in discerning a pointer
from a setter, when once he had been told the distinction, and his perceptive
powers were not at all deficient. I fancy they were quite as strong as
those of the Rev. Mr Stelling; for Tom could predict with accuracy what
number of horses were cantering behind him, he could throw a stone right
into the centre of a given ripple, he could guess to a fraction how many
lengths of his stick it would take to reach across the playground, and
could draw almost perfect squares on his slate without any measurement.
But Mr Stelling took no note of these things: he only observed that Tom's
faculties failed him before the abstractions hideously symbolised to him
in the pages of the Eton Grammar, and that he was in a state bordering
on idiocy with regard to the demonstration that two given triangles must
be equal - though he could discern with great promptitude and certainty
the fact that they <I>were</I> equal. Whence Mr Stelling concluded that
Tom's brain being peculiarly impervious to etymology and demonstrations,
was peculiarly in need of being ploughed and harrowed by these patent implements:
it was his favourite metaphor, that the classics and geometry constituted
that culture of the mind which prepared it for the reception of any subsequent
crop. I say nothing against Mr Stelling's theory: if we are to have one
regimen for all minds his seems to me as good as any other. I only know
it turned out as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as if he had been plied
with cheese in order to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from
digesting it. It is astonishing what a different result one gets by changing
the metaphor! Once call the brain an intellectual stomach, and one's ingenious
conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to
settle nothing. But then, it is open to some one else to follow great authorities
and call the mind a sheet of white paper or a mirror, in which case one's
knowledge of the digestive process becomes quite irrelevant. It was doubtless
an ingenious idea to call the camel the ship of the desert, but it would
hardly lead one far in training that useful beast. O Aristotle! if you
had had the advantage of being `the freshest modern' instead of the greatest
ancient, would you not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech
as a sign of high intelligence, with a lamentation that intelligence so
rarely shows itself in speech without metaphor, - that we can so seldom
declare what a thing is, except by saying it is something else?

<P>Tom Tulliver being abundant in no form of speech, did not use any metaphor
to declare his views as to the nature of Latin: he never called it an instrument
of torture; and it was not until he had got on some way in the next half-year
and in the Delectus, that he was advanced enough to call it a `bore' and
`beastly stuff'. At present, in relation to this demand that he should
learn Latin declensions and conjugations, Tom was in a state of as blank
unimaginativeness concerning the cause and tendency of his sufferings,
as if he had been an innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split trunk
of an ash tree in order to cure lameness in cattle. It is doubtless almost
incredible to instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve,
not belonging strictly to `the masses' who are now understood to have the
monopoly of mental darkness, should have had no distinct idea how there
came to be such a thing as Latin on this earth: yet so it was with Tom.
It would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there
ever existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen and transacted
the everyday affairs of life through the medium of this language, and still
longer to make him understand why he should be called upon to learn it,
when its connection with those affairs had become entirely latent. So far
as Tom had gained any acquaintance with the Romans at Mr Jacobs' Academy,
his knowledge was strictly correct, but it went no farther than the fact
that they were `in the New Testament.' And Mr Stelling was not the man
to enfeeble and emasculate his pupil's mind by simplifying and explaining,
or to reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering,
extraneous information such as is given to girls.

<P>Yet, strange to say, under this vigorous treatment Tom became more like
a girl than he had ever been in his life before. He had a large share of
pride, which had hitherto found itself very comfortable in the world, despising
Old Goggles, and reposing in the sense of unquestioned rights: but now
this same pride met with nothing but bruises and crushings. Tom was too
clear-sighted not to be aware that Mr Stelling's standard of things was
quite different, was certainly something higher in the eyes of the world,
than that of the people he had been living amongst, and that brought in
contact with it, he, Tom Tulliver, appeared uncouth and stupid: he was
by no means indifferent to this, and his pride got into an uneasy condition
which quite nullified his boyish self-satisfaction, and gave him something
of the girl's susceptibility. He was of a very firm, not to say obstinate,
disposition, but there was no brute-like rebellion and recklessness in
his nature: the human sensibilities predominated, and if it had occurred
to him that he could enable himself to show some quickness at his lessons
and so acquire Mr Stelling's approbation, by standing on one leg for an
inconvenient length of time or rapping his head moderately against the
wall, or any voluntary action of that sort, he would certainly have tried
it. But no - Tom had never heard that these measures would brighten the
understanding, or strengthen the verbal memory; and he was not given to
hypothesis and experiment. It did occur to him that he could perhaps get
some help by praying for it, but as the prayers he said every evening were
forms learned by heart, he rather shrank from the novelty and irregularity
of introducing an extempore passage on a topic of petition for which he
was not aware of any precedent. But one day when he had broken down for
the fifth time in the supines of the third conjugation, and Mr Stelling,
convinced that this must be carelessness, since it transcended the bounds
of possible stupidity, had lectured him very seriously, pointing out that
if he failed to seize the present golden opportunity of learning supines,
he would have to regret it when he became a man, - Tom, more miserable
than usual, determined to try his sole resource, and that evening, after
his usual form of prayer for his parents and `little sister' (he had begun
to pray for Maggie when she was a baby) and that he might be able always
to keep God's commandments, he added, in the same low whisper, `And please
to make me always remember my Latin.' He paused a little to consider how
he should pray about Euclid - Whether he should ask to see what it meant,
or whether there was any other mental state which would be more applicable
to the case. But at last he added - `And make Mr Stelling say I shan't
do Euclid any more. Amen.'

<P>The fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day,
encouraged him to persevere in this appendix to his prayers, and neutralised
any scepticism that might have arisen from Mr Stelling's continued demand
for Euclid. But his faith broke down under the apparent absence of all
help when he got into the irregular verbs. It seemed clear that Tom's despair
under the caprices of the present tense did not constitute a <I>nodus</I>
worthy of interference, and since this was the climax of his difficulties,
where was the use of praying for help any longer? He made up his mind to
this conclusion in one of his dull, lonely evenings, which he spent in
the study, preparing his lessons for the morrow. His eyes were apt to get
dim over the page - though he hated crying and was ashamed of it: he couldn't
help thinking with some affection even of Spouncer whom he used to fight
and quarrel with; he would have felt at home with Spouncer, and in a condition
of superiority. And then the mill, and the river, and Yap pricking up his
ears, ready to obey the least sign when Tom said `Hoigh!' would all come
before him in a sort of calenture, when his fingers played absently in
his pocket with his great knife and his coil of whip-cord, and other relics
of the past. Tom, as I said, had never been so much like a girl in his
life before, and at that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further
depressed by a new means of mental development, which had been thought
of for him out of school hours. Mrs Stelling had lately had her second
baby, and as nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself
useful, Mrs Stelling considered she was doing Tom a service by setting
him to watch the little cherub Laura, while the nurse was occupied with
the sickly baby. It was quite a pretty employment for Tom to take little
Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day - it would help to make
him feel that Lorton Parsonage was a home for him, and that he was one
of the family. The little cherub Laura, not being an accomplished walker
at present, had a ribbon fastened round her waist, by which Tom held her
as if she had been a little dog, during the minutes in which she chose
to walk, but as these were rare, he was for the most part carrying this
fine child round and round the garden, within sight of Mrs Stelling's window
- according to orders. If any one considers this unfair and even oppressive
towards Tom, I beg him to consider that there are feminine virtues which
are with difficulty combined, even if they are not incompatible. When the
wife of a poor curate contrives under all her disadvantages to dress extremely
well, and to have a style of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall
occasionally officiate as lady's maid, - when, moreover, her dinner parties
and her drawing-room show that effort at elegance and completeness of appointment
to which ordinary women might imagine a large income necessary, it would
be unreasonable to expect of her that she should employ a second nurse
or even act as a nurse herself. Mr Stelling knew better: he saw that his
wife did wonders already, and was proud of her: it was certainly not the
best thing in the world for young Tulliver's gait, to carry a heavy child,
but he had plenty of exercise in long walks with himself, and next half-year
Mr Stelling would see about having a drilling-master. Among the many means
whereby Mr Stelling intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his
fellow-men, he had entirely given up that of having his own way in his
own house. What then? he had married `as kind a little soul as ever breathed'
according to Mr Riley, who had been acquainted with Mrs Stelling's blond
ringlets and smiling demeanour throughout her maiden life and on the strength
of that knowledge would have been ready any day to pronounce that whatever
domestic differences might arise in her married life must be entirely Mr
Stelling's fault.

<P>If Tom had had a worse disposition, he would certainly have hated the
little cherub Laura, but he was too kind-hearted a lad for that - there
was too much in him of the fibre that turns to true manliness, and to protecting
pity for the weak. I am afraid he hated Mrs Stelling, and contracted a
lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits as directly associated
with haughtiness of manner and a frequent reference to other people's `duty.'
But he couldn't help playing with little Laura, and liking to amuse her:
he even sacrificed his percussion-caps for her sake, in despair of their
ever serving a greater purpose - thinking the small flash and bang would
delight her, and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from Mrs Stelling
for teaching her child to play with fire. Laura was a sort of playfellow
- and O how Tom longed for playfellows! In his secret heart, he yearned
to have Maggie with him, and was almost ready to doat on her exasperating
acts of forgetfulness; though when he was at home, he always represented
it as a great favour on his part to let Maggie trot by his side on his
pleasure excursions.

<P>And before this dreary half year was ended, Maggie actually came. Mrs
Stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and
stay with her brother; so when Mr Tulliver drove over to King's Lorton
late in October, Maggie came too, with the sense that she was taking a
great journey and beginning to see the world. It was Mr Tulliver's first
visit to see Tom, for the lad must learn not to think too much about home.

<P>`Well, my lad,' he said to Tom, when Mr Stelling had left the room to
announce the arrival to his wife, and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom freely,
`you look rarely! School agrees with you.'--

<P>Tom wished he had looked rather ill.

<P>`I don't think I <I>am</I> well, father,' said Tom. `I wish you'd ask
Mr Stelling not to let me do Euclid - it brings on the toothache, I think.'

<P>(The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject.)

<P>`Euclid, my lad - why, what's that?' said Mr Tulliver.

<P>`O I don't know: it's definitions and axioms and triangles and things.
It's a book I've got to learn in - there's no sense in it.'

<P>`Go, go!' said Mr Tulliver, reprovingly, `you mustn't say so. You must
learn what your master tells you. He knows what it's right for you to learn.'

<P>`<I>I'll</I> help you now, Tom,' said Maggie, with a little air of patronising
consolation. `I'm come to stay ever so long, if Mrs Stelling asks me. I've
brought my box and my pinafores, haven't I, father?'

<P>`<I>You</I> help me, you silly little thing!' said Tom, in such high
spirits at this announcement, that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding
Maggie by showing her a page of Euclid. `I should like to see you doing
one of <I>my</I> lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never learn such
things. They're too silly.'

<P>`I know what Latin is very well,' said Maggie, confidently. `Latin's
a language. There are Latin words in the Dictionary. There's bonus, a gift.'

<P>`Now, you're just wrong there, Miss Maggie!' said Tom, secretly astonished.
`You think you're very wise! But "bonus" means "good," as it happens -
bonus, bona, bonum.'

<P>`Well, that's no reason why it shouldn't mean "gift," ' said Maggie,
stoutly. `It may mean several things. Almost every word does. There's `lawn'
- it means the grass plot, as well as the stuff pocket-handkerchiefs are
made of.'

<P>`Well done, little 'un,' said Mr Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt
rather disgusted with Maggie's knowingness, though beyond measure cheerful
at the thought that she was going to stay with him. Her conceit would soon
be overawed by the actual inspection of his books.

<P>Mrs Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time
than a week for Maggie's stay, but Mr Stelling, who took her between his
knees and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from, insisted that she
must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr Stelling was a charming man, and
Mr Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench where she would have
an opportunity of showing her cleverness to appreciating strangers. So
it was agreed that she should not be fetched home till the end of the fortnight.

<P>`Now then, come with me into the study, Maggie,' said Tom, as their
father drove away. `What do you shake and toss your head now for, you silly?'
he continued; for though her hair was now under a new dispensation and
was brushed smoothly behind her ears, she seemed still in imagination to
be tossing it out of her eyes. `It makes you look as if you were crazy.'

<P>`O, I can't help it,' said Maggie impatiently. `Don't tease me, Tom.
O what books!' she exclaimed, as she saw the bookcases in the study. `How
I should like to have as many books as that!'

<P>`Why, you couldn't read one of 'em,' said Tom, triumphantly. `They're
all Latin.'

<P>`No, they aren't,' said Maggie. `I can read the back of this... History
of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'

<P>`Well, what does that mean? <I>You</I> don't know,' said Tom, wagging
his head.

<P>`But I could soon find out,' said Maggie, scornfully.

<P>`Why, how?'

<P>`I should look inside and see what it was about.'

<P>`You'd better not, Miss Maggie,' said Tom, seeing her hand on the volume.
`Mr Stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave, and <I>I</I> shall
catch it, if you take it out.'

<P>`O very well! Let me see all <I>your</I> books, then,' said Maggie,
turning to throw her arms round Tom's neck, and rub his cheek with her
small round nose.

<P>Tom, in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute
with and crow over again, seized her round the waist and began to jump
with her round the large library table. Away they jumped with more and
more vigour, till Maggie's hair flew from behind her ears and twirled about
like an animated mop. But the revolutions round the table became more and
more irregular in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr Stelling's reading-stand,
they sent it thundering down with its heavy lexicons to the floor. Happily
it was the ground-floor, and the study was a one-storied wing to the house,
so that the downfall made no alarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy
and aghast for a few minutes, dreading the appearance of Mr or Mrs Stelling.

<P>`O, I say, Maggie,' said Tom at last, lifting up the stand, `we must
keep quiet here, you know. If we break anything, Mrs Stelling 'll make
us cry peccavi.'

<P>`What's that?' said Maggie.

<P>`O it's the Latin for a good scolding,' said Tom, not without some pride
in his knowledge.

<P>`Is she a cross woman?' said Maggie.

<P>`I believe you!' said Tom, with an emphatic nod.

<P>`I think all women are crosser than men,' said Maggie. `Aunt Glegg's
a great deal crosser than Uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than father
does.'

<P>`Well, <I>you'll</I> be a woman some day,' said Tom, `so <I>you</I>
needn't talk.'

<P>`But I shall be a <I>clever</I> woman,' said Maggie, with a toss.

<P>`O, I dare say, and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody'll hate you.'

<P>`But you oughtn't to hate me, Tom: it'll be very wicked of you, for
I shall be your sister.'

<P>`Yes, but if you're a nasty disagreeable thing, I <I>shall</I> hate
you.'

<P>`O but, Tom, you won't! I shan't be disagreeable. I shall be very good
to you - and I shall be good to everybody. You won't hate me really, will
you, Tom?'

<P>`O bother! never mind! Come, it's time for me to learn my lessons. See
here! what I've got to do,' said Tom, drawing Maggie towards him and showing
her his theorem, while she pushed her hair behind her ears and prepared
herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid. She began to
read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently becoming quite
bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was unavoidable - she
must confess her incompetence and she was not fond of humiliation.

<P>`It's nonsense!' she said. `And very ugly stuff - nobody need want to
make it out.'

<P>`Ah, there now, Miss Maggie!' said Tom, drawing the book away and wagging
his head at her, `you see you're not so clever as you thought you were.'

<P>`O,' said Maggie, pouting, `I dare say I could make it out, if I'd learned
what goes before, as you have.'

<P>`But that's what you just couldn't, Miss Wisdom,' said Tom. `For it's
all the harder when you know what goes before: for then you've got to say
what Definition 3 is and what Axiom V. is. But get along with you now:
I must go on with this. Here's the Latin Grammar. See what you can make
of that.'

<P>Maggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical
mortification; for she delighted in new words, and quickly found that there
was an English Key at the end, which would make her very wise about Latin
at slight expense. She presently made up her mind to skip the rules in
the Syntax, - the examples became so absorbing. These mysterious sentences
snatched from an unknown context, - like strange horns of beasts leaves
of unknown plants, brought from some far-off region, gave boundless scope
to her imagination, and were all the more fascinating because they were
in a peculiar tongue of their own, which she could learn to interpret.
It was really very interesting - the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no
girls could learn: and she was proud because she found it interesting.
The most fragmentary examples were her favourites. <I>Mors omnibus est
communis</I> would have been jejune, only she liked to know the Latin;
but the fortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he had
a son `endowed with <I>such</I> a disposition' afforded her a great deal
of pleasant conjecture, and she was quite lost in the `thick grove penetrable
by no star,' when Tom called out,

<P>`Now, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!'

<P>`O Tom, it's such a pretty book!' she said, as she jumped out of the
large arm-chair to give it him, `it's much prettier than the Dictionary.
I could learn Latin very soon. I don't think it's at all hard.'

<P>`O I know what you've been doing,' said Tom, `you've been reading the
English at the end. And donkey can do that.'

<P>Tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like
air as much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys would
find themselves equal to. Maggie, rather piqued, turned to the bookcases
to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles.

<P>Presently Tom called to her: `Here, Magsie, come and hear if I can say
this. Stand at that end of the table, where Mr Stelling sits when he hears
me.'

<P>Maggie obeyed and took the open book.

<P>`Where do you begin, Tom?'

<P>`O, I begin at `<I>Appellativa arborum</I>,' because I say all over
again what I've been learning this week.'

<P>Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning
to forget her office of prompter, in speculating as to what <I>mas</I>
could mean, which came twice over, when he stuck fast at <I>Sunt etiam
volucrum</I>.

<P>`Don't tell me, Maggie; <I>Sunt etiam volucrum... Sunt etiam volucrum...
ut ostrea, cetus</I>... '

<P>`No,' said Maggie, opening her mouth and shaking her head.

<P>`<I>Sunt etiam volucrum</I>,' said Tom, very slowly, as if the next
words might be expected to come sooner, when he gave them this strong hint
that they were waited for.

<P>`C, e, u,' said Maggie, getting impatient.

<P>`O, I know - hold your tongue,' said Tom. `<I>Ceu passer, hirundo, ferarum...
ferarum</I>... ' Tom took his pencil and made several hard dots with it
on his book-cover... `<I>ferarum</I>... '

<P>`O dear, O dear Tom,' said Maggie, `what a time you are! <I>Ut</I>...
'

<P>`<I>Ut, ostrea</I>... '

<P>`No, no,' said Maggie, `<I>ut, tigris</I>... '

<P>`O yes, now I can do,' said Tom, `it was <I>tigris, vulpes</I>, I'd
forgotten: <I>ut tigris, vulpes, et piscium</I>.'

<P>With some further stammering and repetition, Tom got through the next
few lines.

<P>`Now then,' he said `the next is what I've just learnt for to-morrow.
Give me hold of the book a minute.'

<P>After some whispered gabbling, assisted by the beating of his fist on
the table, Tom returned the book.

<P>`<I>Mascula nomina in a</I>,' he began.

<P>`No, Tom,' said Maggie, `that doesn't come next. It's <I>Nomen non creskens
genittivo</I>... '

<P>`<I>Creskens genittivo</I>,' exclaimed Tom, with a derisive laugh, for
Tom had learned this omitted passage for his yesterday's lesson, and a
young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance
with Latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false quantity.
`<I>Creskens genittivo</I>! What a little silly you are, Maggie!'

<P>`Well, you needn't laugh, Tom, for you didn't remember it at all. I'm
sure it's spelt so. How was I to know?'

<P>`Phee-e-e-h! I told you girls couldn't learn Latin. It's <I>Nomen non
crescens genitivo</I>.'

<P>`Very well, then,' said Maggie, pouting. `I can say that as well as
you can. And you Don't mind your stops. For you ought to stop twice as
long at a semicolon as you do at a comma, and you make the longest stops
where there ought to be no stop at all.'

<P>`O well, don't chatter. Let me go on.'

<P>They were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the
drawing-room, and Maggie became so animated with Mr Stelling, who she felt
sure, admired her cleverness, that Tom was rather amazed and alarmed at
her audacity. But she was suddenly subdued by Mr Stelling's alluding to
a little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away to the gypsies.

<P>`What a very odd little girl that must be!' said Mrs Stelling, meaning
to be playful, but a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was
not at all to Maggie's taste. She feared Mr Stelling, after all, did not
think much of her, and went to bed in rather low spirits. Mrs Stelling,
she felt, looked at her as if she thought her hair was very ugly because
it hung down straight behind.

<P>Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie - this visit to
Tom. She was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons, and in
her various readings got very deep into the examples in the Latin Grammar.
The astronomer who hated women generally caused her so much puzzling speculation
that she one day asked Mr Stelling if all astronomers hated women, or whether
it was only this particular astronomer. But, forestalling his answer, she
said,

<P>`I suppose it's all astronomers: because you know, they live up in high
towers, and if the women came there, they might talk and hinder them from
looking at the stars.'

<P>Mr Stelling liked her prattle immensely, and they were on the best terms.
She told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr Stelling, as he did,
and learn just the same things. She knew she could do Euclid, for she had
looked into it again, and she saw what A B C meant: they were the names
of the lines.

<P>`I'm sure you couldn't do it, now,' said Tom. `And I'll just ask Mr
Stelling if you could.'

<P>`I don't mind,' said the little conceited minx. `I'll ask him myself.'

<P>`Mr Stelling,' she said, that same evening, when they were in the drawing-room,
`couldn't I do Euclid, and all Tom's lessons, if you were to teach me instead
of him?'

<P>`No; you couldn't,' said Tom, indignantly. `Girls can't do Euclid: can
they, sir?'

<P>`They can pick up a little of everything, I daresay,' said Mr Stelling.
`They've a great deal of superficial cleverness: but they couldn't go far
into anything. They're quick and shallow.'

<P>Tom, delighted with this verdict, telegraphed his triumph by wagging
his head at Maggie behind Mr Stelling's chair. As for Maggie, she had hardly
ever been so mortified: she had been so proud to be called `quick' all
her little life, and now it appeared that this quickness was the brand
of inferiority. It would have been better to be slow, like Tom.

<P>`Ha, ha! Miss Maggie!' said Tom, when they were alone, `you see it's
not such a fine thing to be quick. You'll never go far into anything, you
know.'

<P>And Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no
spirit for a retort.

<P>But when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away
in the gig by Luke, and the study was once more quite lonely for Tom, he
missed her grievously. He had really been brighter and had got through
his lessons better since she had been there; and she had asked Mr Stelling
so many questions about the Roman Empire, and whether there really ever
was a man who said in Latin, `I would not buy it for a farthing or a rotten
nut,' or whether that had only been turned into Latin - that Tom had actually
come to a dim understanding of the fact that there had once been people
upon the earth who were so fortunate as to know Latin without learning
it through the medium of the Eton Grammar. This luminous idea was a great
addition to his historical acquirements during this half year which were
otherwise confined to an epitomised History of the Jews.

<P>But the dreary half year <I>did</I> come to an end. How glad Tom was
to see the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind! The dark
afternoons and the first December snow seemed to him far livelier than
the August sunshine; and that he might make himself the surer about the
flight of the days that were carrying him homeward, - he stuck twenty-one
sticks deep in a corner of the garden when he was three weeks from the
holidays, and pulled one up every day with a great wrench, throwing it
to a distance, with a vigour of will which would have carried it to limbo,
if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far.

<P>But it was worth purchasing, even at the heavy price of the Latin Grammar
- the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlour at home as the
gig passed noiselessly over the snow-covered bridge: the happiness of passing
from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles of that familiar
hearth where the pattern of the rug and the grate and the fire-irons were
`first ideas' that it was no more possible to criticise than the solidity
and extension of matter. There is no sense of ease like the ease we felt
in those scenes where we were born, where objects became dear to us before
we had known the labour of choice, and where the outer world seemed only
an extension of our own personality: we accepted and loved it as we accepted
our own sense of existence and our own limbs. Very commonplace, even ugly,
that furniture of our early home might look if it were put up to auction:
an improved taste in upholstery scorns it; and is not the striving after
something better and better in our surroundings, the grand characteristic
that distinguishes man from the brute - or, to satisfy a scrupulous accuracy
of definition, that distinguishes the British man from the foreign brute?
But heaven knows where that striving might lead us, if our affections had
not a trick of twining round those old inferior things, if the loves and
sanctities of our life had no deep immovable roots in memory. One's delight
in an elderberry bush overhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow bank
as a more gladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading
itself on the softest undulating turf, is an entirely unjustifiable preference
to a landscape-gardener, or to any of those severely regulated minds who
are free from the weakness of any attachment that does not rest on a demonstrable
superiority of qualities. And there is no better reason for preferring
this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory - that it is no
novelty in my life speaking to me merely through my present sensibilities
to form and colour, but the long companion of my existence that wove itself
into my joys when joys were vivid.
