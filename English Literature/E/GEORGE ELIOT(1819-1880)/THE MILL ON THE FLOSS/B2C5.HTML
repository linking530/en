Maggie's Second Visit</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>THIS last breach between the two lads was not readily mended and for
some time they spoke to each other no more than was necessary. Their natural
antipathy of temperament made resentment an easy passage to hatred, and
in Philip the transition seemed to have begun: there was no malignity in
his disposition, but there was a susceptibility that made him peculiarly
liable to a strong sense of repulsion. The ox - we may venture to assert
it on the authority of a great classic - is not given to use his teeth
as an instrument of attack; and Tom was an excellent bovine lad, who ran
at questionable objects in a truly ingenuous bovine manner; but he had
blundered on Philip's tenderest point, and had caused him as much acute
pain as if he had studied the means with the nicest precision and the most
envenomed spite. Tom saw no reason why they should not make up this quarrel
as they had done many others, by behaving as if nothing had happened; for
though he had never before said to Philip that his father was a rogue,
this idea had so habitually made part of his feeling as to the relation
between himself and his dubious schoolfellow, whom he could neither like
nor dislike, that the mere utterance did not make such an epoch to him
as it did to Philip. And he had a right to say so, when Philip hectored
over <I>him</I> and called him names. But perceiving that his first advances
towards amity were not met, he relapsed into his least favourable disposition
towards Philip, and resolved never to appeal to him either about drawing
or exercises again. They were only so far civil to each other as was necessary
to prevent their state of feud from being observed by Mr Stelling, who
would have `put down' such nonsense with great vigour. When Maggie came,
however, she could not help looking with growing interest at the new school-fellow,
although he was the son of that wicked Lawyer Wakem who made her father
so angry. She had arrived in the middle of school- hours, and had sat by
while Philip went through his lessons with Mr Stelling. Tom, some weeks
ago, had sent her word that Philip knew no end of stories - not stupid
stories like hers - and she was convinced now from her own observation
that he must be very clever: she hoped he would think <I>her</I> rather
clever too, when she came to talk to him. Maggie moreover had rather a
tenderness for deformed things; she preferred the wry-necked lambs, because
it seemed to her that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn't
mind so much about being petted, and she was especially fond of petting
objects that would think it very delightful to be petted by her. She loved
Tom very dearly, but she often wished that he <I>cared</I> more about her
loving him.

<P>`I think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy, Tom,' she said, when they went
out of the study together into the garden, to pass the interval before
dinner. `He couldn't choose his father, you know; and I've read of very
bad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad children.
And if Philip is good, I think we ought to be the more sorry for him because
his father is not a good man. <I>You</I> like him, don't you?'

<P>`O, he's a queer fellow,' said Tom, curtly, `and he's as sulky as can
be with me, because I told him his father was a rogue. And I'd a right
to tell him so, for it was true - and <I>he</I> began it, with calling
me names. But you can stop here by yourself a bit, Magsie, will you? I've
got something I want to do upstairs.'

<P>`Can't I go too?' said Maggie, who, in this first day of meeting again,
loved Tom's shadow.

<P>`No, it's something I'll tell you about by and by, not yet,' said Tom,
skipping away.

<P>In the afternoon, the boys were at their books in the study, preparing
the morrow's lessons, that they might have a holiday in the evening in
honour of Maggie's arrival. Tom was hanging over his Latin grammar, moving
his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic repeating his tale
of paternosters, and Philip, at the other end of the room, was busy with
two volumes, with a look of contented diligence that excited Maggie's curiosity:
he did not look at all as if he were learning a lesson. She sat on a low
stool at nearly right angle with the two boys, watching first one and then
the other, and Philip looking off his book once towards the fireplace,
caught the pair of questioning dark eyes fixed upon him. He thought this
sister of Tulliver's seemed a nice little thing, quite unlike her brother:
he wished <I>he</I> had a little sister. What was it, he wondered, that
made Maggie's dark eyes remind him of the stories about princesses being
turned into animals?... I think it was, that her eyes were full of unsatisfied
intelligence and unsatisfied, beseeching affection.

<P>`I say, Magsie,' said Tom at last, shutting his books and putting them
away with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of `leaving
off,' `I've done my lessons now. Come upstairs with me.'

<P>`What is it?' said Maggie when they were outside the door, a slight
suspicion crossing her mind as she remembered Tom's Preliminary visit upstairs.
`It isn't trick you're going to play me, now?'

<P>`No, no, Maggie,' said Tom, in his most coaxing tone. `It's something
you'll like <I>ever</I> so.'

<P>He put his arm round her neck, and she put hers round his waist, and
twined together in this way, they went upstairs.

<P>`I say, Magsie, you must not tell anybody, you know,' said Tom, `else
I shall get fifty lines.'

<P>`Is it alive?' said Maggie, whose imagination had settled for the moment
on the idea that Tom kept a ferret clandestinely.

<P>`O, I shan't tell you,' said he. `Now you go into that corner and hide
your face while I reach it out,' he added as he locked the bedroom door
behind them. `I'll tell you when to turn round. You mustn't squeal out,
you know'

<P>`O, but if you frighten me, I shall,' said Maggie, beginning to look
rather serious.

<P>`You won't be frightened, you silly thing,' said Tom. `Go and hide your
face and mind you don't peep.'

<P>`Of course I shan't peep,' said Maggie, disdainfully: and she buried
her face in the pillow like a person of strict honour.

<P>But Tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet; then he stepped
into the narrow space, and almost closed the door. Maggie kept her face
buried without the aid of principle, for in that dream-suggestive attitude
she had soon forgotten where she was, and her thoughts were busy with the
poor deformed boy who was so clever, when Tom called out, `Now then, Magsie!'

<P>Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects
could have enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he did to Maggie
when she looked up. Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a face which
had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow, together with a pair
of amiable blue-grey eyes and round pink cheeks that refused to look formidable
let him frown as he would before the looking-glass - (Philip had once told
him of a man who had a horseshoe frown, and Tom had tried with all his
frowning might to make a horseshoe on his forehead) - he had had recourse
to that unfailing source of the terrible, burnt cork, and had made himself
a pair of black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose
and were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin.
He had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air
of a turban, and his red comforter across his breast as a scarf - an amount
of red which, with the tremendous frown on his brow, and the decision with
which he grasped the sword as he held it with its point resting on the
ground, would suffice to convey an approximate idea of his fierce and bloodthirsty
disposition.

<P>Maggie looked bewildered for a moment, and Tom enjoyed that moment keenly;
but in the next, she laughed, clapped her hands together and said, `O Tom,
You've made yourself like Bluebeard at the show.'

<P>It was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword
- it was not unsheathed. Her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal
to its sense of the terrible, and Tom prepared for his masterstroke. Frowning
with a double amount of intention, if not of corrugation, he (carefully)
drew the sword from its sheath and pointed it at Maggie.

<P>`O Tom, please don't,' exclaimed Maggie, in a tone of suppressed dread,
shrinking away from him into the opposite corner, `I <I>shall</I> scream
- I'm sure I shall! O don't! I wish I'd never come upstairs!'

<P>The corners of Tom's mouth showed an inclination to a smile of complacency
that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the severity of a great
warrior. Slowly he let down the scabbard on the floor, lest it should make
too much noise, and then said, sternly,

<P>`I'm the Duke of Wellington! March!' stamping forward with the right
leg a little bent, and the sword still pointing towards Maggie, who, trembling,
and with tear-filled eyes, got upon the bed, as the only means of widening
the space between them.

<P>Tom, happy in this spectator of his military performances, even though
the spectator was only Maggie, proceeded with the utmost exertion of his
force, to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would necessarily
be expected of the Duke of Wellington.

<P>`Tom, I <I>will not</I> bear it - I <I>will</I> scream,' said Maggie,
at the first movement of the sword. `You'll hurt yourself, you'll cut your
head off!'

<P>`One - two,' said Tom, resolutely, though at `two' his wrist trembled
a little. `Three,' came more slowly, and with it the sword swung downwards,
and Maggie gave a loud shriek. The sword had fallen, with its edge on Tom's
foot, and in a moment after, he had fallen too. Maggie leaped from the
bed, still shrieking, and immediately there was a rush of footsteps towards
the room. Mr Stelling, from his upstairs study, was the first to enter.
He found both the children on the floor. Tom had fainted and Maggie was
shaking him by the collar of his jacket, screaming, with wild eyes. She
thought he was dead, poor child! and yet she shook him as if that would
bring him back to life. In another minute she was sobbing with joy because
Tom had opened his eyes. She couldn't sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot
- it seemed as if all happiness lay in his being alive.
